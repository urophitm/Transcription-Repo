Welcome to Stem Talk. Stem Talk. Stem Talk. Stem Talk. Stem Talk. Welcome to Stem Talk, where we introduce you to fascinating people who passionately inhabit the scientific and technical frontiers of our society. Hi, I'm your host Don Conegis, and joining me to introduce today's podcast is a man behind the curtain, Dr. Ken Ford, HMC's director and chairman of the Double Secret Selection Committee that sucks all the guests who appear in Stem Talk. Hi Don, great to be here today. So our guest today is HMC's high-performance director Joe Gomes. Joe became our colleague a little more than a year ago after spending three years as the head strength and conditioning coach for the NFL's Oakland Raiders. He was with that team for the 2016 season when the Raiders won 12 games and went to the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. And although Joe has spent most of his career helping professional and amateur athletes, he also spent five years at Fort Bragg and North Carolina as a senior advisor and performance director for the United States Army Special Operations Command. So Joe came to HMC to be part of a new biologically oriented team that is searching for innovative ways to extend the capabilities and resilience of high-performing humans who operate in extreme environments. In today's interview, you're going to hear Joe talk about a number of projects, including his work with HMC's engineers and NASA to develop an exercise machine for deep space missions, such as a trip to Mars. But before we get to today's interview with Joe, we have some housekeeping to take care of. First, we really appreciate all of you who have subscribed to StemTalk and we are especially appreciative of all the wonderful five-star reviews.

Well, thank you Gas Passer-PK and thank you to all of our other StemTalk listeners who have helped StemTalk become such a great success. And just as a note, unfortunately, I was not able to be here for Joe's interview, so Ken is going solo on this one. So without further ado, here's Ken's interview with Joe. StemTalk is done to StemTalk. StemTalk. StemTalk. Hi, this is Ken Ford. Don is busy playing hooky today, so I will be on my own. Today, our guest is Joe Gomes. Welcome, Joe. Hey Ken, great to be here. Glad to have you. So let's start right at the beginning. Where did you grow up and what was your childhood like? Well, I was born in Bristol, England. I lived my younger years in rural Norfolk, about two to three hours north east of London. And then on to London for about eight years prior to moving to the United States. Somewhat of a mixed breed on my mother's side. I have an English grandmother and a Polish grandfather. They met post-laboration of Europe in London after World War II. On my dad's side, he's a native Caribbean, so Indigenous South American. Family heritage in Guyana, and we have family in Trinidad and Barbados. Norfolk was a great place to grow up for young kids amongst the farming communities. It was also my first real exposure to the military. What kind of kid were you? I suspect you must have played a lot of sports when you were young. I say perception is 9-10's reality, and I think my perception of reality as I was an awesome kid. I'm sure to my mom who I grew up with, I was probably more of an awesome pain than the ass, but I definitely graduated towards sports, specifically team sports and love competing and being outdoors. I performed decently well in track and field, but definitely had a passion for competing as a team and rugby soccer and basketball were all fun to me as a kid. What drew you to rugby particularly? Was it the teamwork? I think so. Physically, I was a big strong young kid. I played intimately rugby throughout early high school, but I schooled it and actually had a team and all my friends played soccer and they were both winter sports. So there was no real opportunity for me to play it early on. And then around 15 or 16, I was at a track and field meet against some local high schools. And I was competing in the shot in the 100 meters and they were butted up against each other in the schedule. And I had warmed up for the 100, run over to the shot and got a good throw in and then ran back to competing 100. And that event ended up winning both in the coach of the rival school, happened to be the regional rugby coach and he said, we need to get you back into a rugby jersey and a full disclaimer. This is rural England high school track and field. It wasn't particularly competitive level, but it led to a fun time and a fun career. The physicality and the camera audio of rugby that brought a lot to my life. You don't typically see shot putters running the 100 yard dash except for comedic purposes. Exactly. Exactly. You and a friend decided to take some time off from school and you bought airplane tickets as I understand it to Australia. Can you tell us about that and what motivated that adventure? You know, I've found memories of that trip. The education system in the self led for that opportunity to kind of take a gap year and it was pretty common within England. High school, you know, from 10 to 16 years old, we do about eight to 10 subjects. Like college, we go to 16 to 18 years, two to four subjects and then we go to university around 18 through 21 and do study one to two subjects and that gap between college and university had an opportunity moment to take the trip. And at about 17, I had raised money as a bartending and lifeguarding and myself and a friend and two girls we happen to be dating at the time flew out to Darwin right at the top of northern Australia. We bought an old bright yellow Volvo sedan and drove to the middle of Australia and then across to the east coast and all the way down and the plan was to do about six months. We had working visas and after some sporadic and interesting work experiences we decided to cut it short into three months. You know, if we'll go the working and then have a great time and join the country. Sounds interesting. You returned to London after Australia and went back to school where you played varsity rugby and majored in sports rehab and sports science. I can see the connection as an athlete but is there more to it. I always had a fascination with sport certainly at a young age I enjoyed competing and learning about the human body. College I studied sports science and human biology and so the two complemented each other really well. Specifically, it became interested in excise physiology and skill acquisition to improve sports performance and you know, the sports science field really helped kind of fill that interest and that curiosity. You know, I'd also completed a work experience at high school with a local physiotherapist and that was the perfect complement to sports science was the sports rehabilitation and understanding, you know, healing and reconditioning. I understand that even when you were a young fellow you were interested in the science of how the human body worked and that this interest led you to start questioning some of the training techniques that were offered you such as when your rugby coach would say go run two laps. I had similar experiences of questioning the techniques offered by coaches. Could you elaborate on that? Yeah, I think the epiphany was probably too followed there. One from my own learning and understanding academically and then just personal research due to an active interest. The second was exposure as I was entering into, you know, different tiers of rugby throughout the the varsity system there and we got a lot of exposure to different coaches and their own ability. Particularly inspired by an Australian female strength and conditioning coach that had a track and field background, she was able to blend well concepts from physical therapy along with strength conditioning and a track background, you know, provided some really good insight into how we should warm up and prepare for sport. In college, you worked with a gentleman named John Allen who was a physiotherapist and worked with the British track and field team. You helped him set up a hydro therapy program to assist injured athletes with their rehabilitation. It was during this time that you also became involved in a UK program to screen elite athletes who were potential medalists. This sounds like it was a really great opportunity for you. Can you talk a little bit about this? Yeah, that was a great experience. I had done my clinical practice with John and he was a lead physio within the UK athletics system and he had a partner called John Matthews who focused more centric on the tennis side of sport. But post Sydney 2000, there was an influx of antipodian therapists and practitioners from Australia and New Zealand and they introduced to the UK this concept of musculoskeletal screening and looking to identify, you know, structural limiting factors in an athlete in order to help improve their overall performance. And John had invited me along to these screenings and it was a, you know, at the time at a young age and still a still student, it was a fascinating exposure into, you know, what was possible and how you could help complement an athlete to achieve that goals. Although the UK had a lot of good exercise physiologists at the time, strength conditioning was still early days you might even say in its infancy. Could you talk a little bit about how you became expressly interested in strength conditioning? I would say that that's correct in the sense that systematically we had great sports scientists across exercise physiology and biomechanics and, you know, some very talented technical coaches and the strength conditioning field was left to the more sport of Olympic lifting and we had some great technical Olympic lifting coaches as well. But there was no real form of form or part of education or a specific entity until I think about 2004 when the UK Strength Conditioning Association stood up. And so in the early 2000s, there was this kind of this void I had a strong background in sports rehabilitation and in sport and exercise science. But, you know, where I saw the void being is in the delivery of that. And you ended up taking out a career development loan and coming out to the US and visiting, you know, handfuls of great track and field coaches and coaches of physical preparation in sport to, you know, inspire a mum to bring back to the work I was doing in the UK. You attended a sports medicine conference on Las Vegas and must have made a good impression on someone there. Can you share with us how that meeting Las Vegas led to you actually moving to Phoenix? Colleagues of mine from from the UK, one of them was named Scott Perry and he was actually a former professional soccer player. He had actually attended a place called IPI, the international performance institute in Braydenton, Florida and they're part of the famous IMG Academy, the Nick Ballotary-Tennis and Dave Lebetta-Golf and a gentleman named Mark Verstegen had stood up IPI and he left in 1999 to create a company called Athletes Performance and they were headquartered out of Tempe, Arizona. And a friend of mine in the industry, Lauren C. Grave, he's a famous track and field coach, happened to be speaking on speed and acceleration and during a breakout session, I was a I met a gentleman named Daletto and he and I struck a bond and turned out he worked for Athletes Performance when he, Scott and I were kind of spoke, he said, hey, let's we'd love to have you down, come visit us anytime. That continued to develop into a great relationship and in 2005, Athletes Performance signed a contract with the DFB, the German national soccer team and you know, I was congratulating Mark on the on the contract and he mentioned there'd be an opportunity to come out full time and what I'd be interested in moving to Arizona to they were adding new facilities to their business. They had one in Arizona already, they had a facility in LA at the Home Depot Center and they were actually getting ready to stand up, a Florida location which ended up being locally here in Gulf Breeze. And I took that opportunity, I came on board to help, you know, support development of internal education and expand on the core business of trained professional athletes. And they had an outward facing education program called the Mentorship where we would invite strength coaches and physical therapists from professional teams and organizations and personal trainers and shared training methodology and training systems with them. In 2007, you received a call from the Argentinian national rugby team. What did they want? Were they calling you via Athletes Performance or was it Joe all by himself? That came through Athletes Performance. So they had a relationship with the Ditas and the history of rugby is interesting and in Argentina. Rugby as a hall became professional, not till the mid 90s and in terms of kind of world sports, it was very much behind certainly soccer. It should have been professional for a really long time. To this day, I think the club system is still amateur in Argentina and all the players that contracted and played their club rugby in Europe. And they played in France and Italy and England and they understood the need to have a professional support system around them in order to have success. And over 2005, 2006, they've been sliding up the world's rankings and they had a great core group of players that were you know towards the end of their professional careers and they knew they had a great opportunity to do something special. And so they had reached out to us through through an Adidas contact and you know I came down to to golf breads here in Florida and met representatives from the organization and they brought the entire World Cup roster out to the chain here in golf breads and I supported them for two weeks and then ended up going on the road with them through a holding camp in Buenos Aires into eventually Europe and Paris, France for the World Cup. In addition to the physical training that you did with the team, you also worked with the team as I understand it on instilling or creating a winning mindset and as everyone knows in sport that's so important. Can you talk about that as well as what it was like to watch the team's performance in the World Cup? Absolutely. I think it comes down to to anything that we ultimately do. It's it's about not just what we're doing but it's about how we're doing it. You know we're ultimately through our work. We were creating small cultural changes and the shift in perspective. You know we laid out a plan with true conviction. We were purposeful with our intent and our execution and it was all around our winning. You know due to the history and the heritage and the relationships of the players in France and the World Cup being in France, the opening game was actually against the home nation in Paris. You know so we centered a lot of the energy and the emotional prioritization if you like on what we needed to do and how we needed to do it to get the guys ready for that that opening game and we ended up beating France on the home tough and outstanding opening game. We went on an incredible run and eventually lost to South Africa who are the eventual winners of the World Cup in the semi-finals and then we replayed France again for the for the bronze medal and beat them again this time we stuffed them hatchfully in Paris again and so that caused for great celebration. But when we look at all the things that we were ultimately trying to achieve, you know the education and awareness of what we're doing and how we're doing it and still instills you know parts of belief and the more I've kind of been involved in professional sport and business and working with different organizations and through the department of defense and government agencies, you know belief in the process and ultimately belief in themselves is really important. A great friend and colleague Scott Pelton from Tignum, he says you can't outperform your own self image and I think that's true in sport at work and at home. Following up on this theme, I understand and that you're passionate about teaching athletes the importance of self accountability. Is that something that you'd like to talk about? Yeah I think you know when we look at anything that we do from a practitioner standpoint, we're ultimately trying to support a certain level of behavioral change and you know I'm not a shrink by trade. I know a lot of good ones employed them in various capacities as practitioners and consultants on some of the different projects we work on and I think we're only going to have a certain amount of access to the guys and there's only so much we're going to be able to do and support when we're with them and it may be take for example the NFL when you have limited time a certain periods of of the year we may only have two hours with them and that means there's 22 hours in the day that they can ultimately undo what you did or support what you're trying to achieve and so I think education goes a long way and ultimately if you can help facilitate small behavioral changes that's going to pay its dividends in the long run and then ultimately in the short term as well in terms of gain and trust. Looking back on your experience with the Argentinian national team, was there one or two big takeaway findings that seemed key to you in optimizing these athletes? I think the biggest part was probably time management. You have your own plan and then you need to be operationally agile. This was challenging because I didn't speak a lick of Spanish. You're running around trying to wearing several hats trying to make sure that things are done in the best interest of the players and ultimately back with planning from key things such as games or key practices. I think the intent with everyone involved in sport is to including players and coaches and management is to achieve the same thing but often what they're doing or the ordering which they're doing isn't always conducive to the best possible result and so I think time management was a big part of the lessons learned there and I carried deep lessons learned from that experience into you know throughout my entire career. After you finished up your work with the Argentinian national team, you spent the next three years doing what you refer to as your own world tour. That sounds interesting working with different national teams and various national governing bodies and as I understand it you logged something like 300,000 miles a year during this time. Can you tell us a little bit about that time in your life and what was it about? I guess it was exciting coming off the performance in the World Cup. Yeah that was an exciting period. Looking back it was probably more stressful on myself and my body but I was young and audacious enough and wanting to you know really go after the opportunities that were in front of us. Yeah I think it was probably about 340,000 miles for about three years straight. Well in the biggest things I learned and as we were supporting groups across you know South America, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Monaco, London, Paris, Beijing, you know I didn't speak any of those languages and so you really learned to be very deliberate and purposeful about how you're coaching, how you're working, how you're supporting the staff that are on the ground and really you know trying to augment the practitioner and help give them the things they need to do to help support the athletes and the teams and the organizations that they're taking care of. After a period of time, Athletes Performance changed its name to Exos and for about nine years you were the director of performance for Exos and as you mentioned earlier they opened a branch, affiliated with the Andrews Institute which is just a few miles from our labs here at IHMC in Pensacola. You ran the annual NFL Scouting Combine and helped train 35 first round draft picks in a three year period. Can you elaborate further on this program and on this period in your life and in particular if you could focus on the kind of training modalities employed to improve performance specifically at the Combine? Absolutely yeah I would say I don't take any credit for the the work that was done within preparing these athletes. I mean genetically you're looking at the top 1% of the top 1% of athletes that are preparing for this. Our job is there's just really essentially help them prepare for the the biggest job interview of their careers. The NFL is unique in many ways and one of it is its compensation and contracts with players and the only money they're guaranteed is actually the money they guaranteed up front in that initial contract and the second part of that is the average career length is extremely short. We're talking three and a half years maybe less and we would always educate the players coming into this process that you know the NFL stands for not for long and you get an opportunity here to put your best foot forward take care of yourself and your family and potentially have a great career and you know in terms of the preparation and the specifics of that it's a well-alled machine exos and form the athletes performance as it has a great heritage in developing systems and training methodology and complementing practitioners across multiple disciplines all working together under one roof for that for that common goal which is performance in Indianapolis at the at the Combine. You know our weeks and our strategies and our phases were all deliberate we had planned stimulus of teaching and education of certain mechanics and of different drills mechanics of speed of acceleration of starting of maximum velocity and ultimately we're just trying to find choose the physical and model learning attributes so they can go and express that out on for that four day period at the end of February that's coming up now. In many ways the NFL Combine seems quite artificial and quite apart from the game of football and very focused on explosive power and strength and I wonder if the training was aimed at stiffening tendons for better power and strength transfer and that's interesting to me you know one can imagine that you could optimize the athlete from the Combine have them very stiff tendons and find them actually playing football in spring training or the beginning of the season and have the tendons stiffer than the muscle is strong and I wonder if there's been anybody looking at whether there's increased injury rate associated with that and if there is is that mostly down to how the team handled them coming off the Combine. I think that year and of itself for those players is probably the most stressful year that they're physically and probably psychologically that are ever going to go through in their careers. If you imagine you have you know a three or four year collegiate athlete that has you know all the training and the mileage and the games he probably gone to a to a ball game and then he's then training for six to eight weeks in an intensive way and a very specific way to to showcase his physical attributes at the Combine and then few weeks later after a limited time off he then gets to jump into the offseason program and then he goes all the way through the offseason program which is nine to eleven weeks depending on if you've got a new head coach you have a short break and then you go into preseason and camp and then the seasons and when you look at the volume that they've come off accumatively over that part of their careers that the risk is extremely high and we definitely saw a spike in the rookies and I think the same is you know across across all the different teams in the league good teams and teams that you do a good job of educating the you know the coaching staff and other personnel around the athlete understand this and they're able to mitigate that but I would say when you look at the Combine preparation it is a very specific set of developmental drills and training stimulus this designed to help showcase those physical attributes does it build the tissue tolerance needed to play you know an entire season of football probably not and so I think when the player arrives to the team it's responsibility of the practitioner is there to evaluate that much like walking around and you use Carlot you know you know you may have an understanding of how many miles they've done you don't know how hard those miles were and you need to evaluate and test and build a system is going to help prepare them for the long long haul how did you end up working for the United States Army special operations command Fort Bragg in North Carolina how did that evolution take place I would say my understanding is the early 2000s they were a big initiative of one of the soft truths so the special operation forces truths is that humans are more important in hardware and as far as they advance in weapons equipment machines technology vehicles how they looked at the human body was wasn't particularly being addressed and so systematically the so-com entities were looking for universities professional teams private organizations that had a tried and tested history of providing great physical development for individuals and during 2006 we had members of the United States Army special operations command visit us that led to injured guys coming out post deployment with either orthopedic injuries or potentially combat injuries as well we had some some great success in supporting them and that practitioners and getting these guys back into active duty status and you know that led to an opportunity for us to be contracted for providing Humve of Olm's program services for United States Army special operations command it was that Fort Bragg when we first met and I was impressed with your good work there you worked with a lot of soldiers to help them keep their bodies healthier longer these folks are one percentors or less and the goal is to keep them one percentors I saw a lot of good work while I was there you also did that for NFL players and it seems that the NFL and the Army are in some ways similar though in most ways not in that they both have dedicated professionals who are pushing their bodies to the limit what kind of similarities do you see in terms of the training that you did for NFL players and for the elite soldiers that's a great question so I would say number one when you're building out a program it's it's really dependent on your your resources to a certain extent but the the people and the practitioners and the skill and the execution capabilities that they have building a great team around you which is a single most important component of of any program I believe the second would be to philosophically take a look at it what is it you're trying to achieve everyone jumps to the the bigger faster stronger higher you know kind of Olympic standards of physical preparation but often when you really look at what it is you're trying to support it's not to make the best guy in the weight room or the best guy on the track it's how can you help them make the most accurate decision in the shortest amount of time and physical properties will you know important component of you know execution of skill but there are many others such as cognitive and emotional and psychological even spiritual components that go into you know supporting an individual and that program at the within the United States Army and then the same within the NFL we tried to build a really great network of skill practitioners that would help support the individual and we know if we make you know ultimately a great guy that's going to the collection of great guys is going to make a great team you've been hurt to say that your work at Fort Bragg was the most important work you've ever done and I don't have any problem believing that but could you elaborate a little more on that I think it's extremely meaningful from well not only what they stood for as an organization on what they do and how they you know help help this country and the world but it's the type of people they are as well extremely humble when I first got there when I was coaching in the gym a gentleman came up and he was a physical specimen and a very respected veteran of that organization and he said you know Joe I've never worked in so hard in my life just to be average and that just that mindset of the standard of excellence that they have amongst that appears it's very tough to come across I can say I felt it there in that environment and then obviously coming here into IHMC extremely humbled by the level and the standard of the peers and the folks that I get to work with to help help people achieve their goals in life and you know it's an interesting component when you compare the two different groups of people both are highly skilled both have gone through numerous selection periods in order to get there the second distinction I think that is important is that when you're preparing for someone for sport it's largely entertainment and it's you know although it is a extremely fun and rich and challenging environment to work the meaning behind supporting a special operations unit and preparing for the thing them for the things and the jobs that they have to do you know there is a distinct difference and just that you know if if the United States had a national team of all sports I think you know these units would represent that and you know it's not entertainment it is it is war and it's preparing people for you know short-term impact and long-term career sustainability that is you know we take that job and that responsibility really seriously. Stem Talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition for research lab pioneering groundbreaking technologies aimed at leveraging and extending human cognition perception locomotion and resilience. While at Fort Bragg you received a call from Jack Del Rio who was at the time the new head coach of the Oakland Raiders is it true that after the phone call you essentially bought a one-way ticket to Oakland and off you went. There's some truth of that story except I wasn't the one that bought the ticket. My job in Fort Bragg as supporting the organization was really only meant to be a two to three-year deal I remember talking to my wife and saying it's an amazing opportunity to support these guys I felt a distinct responsibility to help them get it right from the start they're extremely fast learners I'm sure will be two to three years and then you know we'll be good and we can move on to the next chapter and so that ended up being you know a five-year amazing experience and towards the end of that my time there yeah I happen to get a call from Jack and after the interview process and we're talking late at night in in in Oakland we said well you know as you make your decision understand that I bought your home-wifeless glass ticket for a reason so I hope to see you in the office tomorrow. Wow that's a method. When you arrived in Oakland you helped plan and open a new performance center and I was pleased to visit it very impressive performance center and the goal of course was to give the Oakland players a stage-of-the-art training facility. How did you go about that pulling that all together and what does a stage-of-the-art training facility either for the elite forces or in this case for the Oakland Raiders what what what what such a facility look like in a nutshell. I think what's important to understand the conceptually success goes beyond a brick and mortar facility you know good practitioners should be out of the execute many shed or patch of dud anywhere on the planet and get the get the job done. The goal of of that performance center in in particular was to create a dynamic and inspiring training environment that we could be really efficient based on the time constraints that we had with the guys and have as much impact as possible and that goes with the size of the facility, the space we wanted to get as much bang for our buck with the square footage and the flow from the locker room through to the nutrition bar and our monitoring systems and our warm-ups our activation series our strength our power our speed work and rolling straight out onto the practice field afterwards and so we wanted to create this you know quote unquote experience for the athlete to come through and create an environment where they we know we they would want to come and hang out and so true to my heritage of being English and enjoying a drink every now and then we didn't just create a feeling station we actually created a fuel bar and we had you know a great boss set up where the guys would come and sit down enjoy pre-juring and post you know training beverages you know create a sense of camaraderie out around it you know shed effort and and shed work which was great and Joe I wonder if the team this year has expanded the bar concept to include tequila and martinis it might explain something no comment there no comment there with respect to optimizing an individual NFL's player performance it would seem that a very personalized approach to training and nutrition might be necessary when one thinks of the needs of say an offensive lineman they seem pretty different from those of a wide receiver how did you and your team accommodate all the different training needs that comes back down to our baseline assessment I think that provided huge insight into the level of the the athlete you take into account also biological age training age they may have and what training systems they used to prior to coming into your environment that baseline evaluation essentially goes from the top of the head down to the bottom of their feet combined with you know physical therapy insight and athletic trainer insight when we profile the guy we want him to make sure that we can provide the best training program and training stimulus for them is based on that individual deficits and prescribe a calling to that within a team setting and that's that's a lot easier to say than it is to execute especially when you're looking at 63 guys during the season you go 53 on the on the roster and 10 practice squad guys and then during the offseason you're looking at 90 guys plus or minus that are going to be you know coming through your your weight room and in college is even higher and so one of the things that we looked to address was okay we were taken individual quality such as strength and make sure we're addressing it to you know this level of specificity that he needed based off his testing results and so if they were limited in peak power or force we would put him on a forced deficit strategy if it was true power it would be more of an a power and explosive strategy and so the entire team would come in to lift at the you know the same time often or different position groups at different times but even within the group setting they've got individualized loading parameters to include sets and reps and targeted velocities for the given loads as well you know to maximize the adaptation we're trying to achieve injuries in the NFL and really in all sports are a common occurrence and clearly can be catastrophic to a season how did you use technology and science to deploy strategies intended to mitigate risk of injury great question there so a large amount of data can be collected on practice on games and what was done in the weight room you know we tried to be as non-invasive as possible to the athlete we try to capture a good understanding of the loads they've been exposed to and secondary to that we look at physiological monitoring and identifying what was the cost of their exposure to those given loads and then pretty quickly we can build a nice model of stress and response and once we're to establish some normative values for a given marker when they breached a certain threshold we knew that they were at risk and we couldn't say what specifically they were at risk for but we knew that there was a strong chance that some of these you know non-contact soft injuries had the potential to occur so the strategy was twofold one we looked at key muscle groups at a high-proud propensity to a for injuries such as a hamstring we individually tested them for strength and endurance and to see if they were at risk during fatigue states and then we looked at the load they were exposed to and that gave us a good indication of what that tissue tolerance could potentially be like and over time if they breached that threshold for say high velocity running then we knew that we had a potential risk and we would modify the practice accordingly in order to support the athlete everyone appreciates the importance of nutrition and performance training for the athletes but what about the coaches and staff it would seem that they must often be not attended to in the same way yeah that's a that's a great point I think when you look at speed and accuracy of decisions not only is it important for a player on game day but is equally important to the coaching staff as well and I think you know as we looked at our program as a whole one of the things that we realized that we could support the team and then still some positive cultural changes as well was you know trying to get the coaches to engage in optimal nutrition health sleep and recovery strategies to improve them and that is where we utilize Scott Pelton and his team from TIGNUM to provide insight to the coaches and education to them and an awareness on the importance of you know cognitive performance and how they can use simple things that's just light exercise or just movement in general to activate the brain the importance of hydration the importance of sleep and how to regulate caffeine in order to make sure that you can you know create an optimal state for brain function. What kind of strategies do you recommend in terms of the preservation of strength and muscle mass both for athletes and for the rest of us. Great question I think the importance of supporting athletic skill and prevention of injury strength is an important physical quality it's also a big parent so maximal strength is a big parent physical quality that supports other strength related qualities such as strength endurance power power endurance as well not to mention you know tissue tolerance and resistance to localized muscle resistance to to fatigue so one of the things we learned and certainly amongst the latter parts of my career is that definitely less less is way more and certainly when you look at accumulation of stress being exposed and we found that you know we looked for what's the least amount we could you know stress the guys with and still get positive adaptation and you know one of the ways we used that was through velocity based training you know wasn't just necessarily a heavy load we found out that you know in season we could get away with still high intensities but for a smaller volume and so we would just do one working set of a high load of anything from 85 up to 95% of an estimated or real one RM if we if we had it and then we would use a lot of high velocity movements tracking speed and you know once they achieved the target velocity for a given load then we would bump them up into the to the next category and a slightly high load and so that was a really good gauge for us that in season we could actually get some positive adaptation and guys still feel strong but with with with limited load on on that body the other concept is a notion of accommodating resistance and you know we we utilize those big strength bands so for squatting activities we're in squatting movements we were attached the bands to the barbell and so at the bottom of the squat we actually found that we had about a you know 25 to 35 kilo of less weight and so at the bottom of the lift when more pressure is on the low back and the and the knees they had some some relief and this is important suddenly in season then but as they came through the sticking point that I still able to accelerate and and achieve you know target loads at target speeds and we found that as a great way to help you know I provide some back off on the total stress I know you feel strongly about the importance of sleep in terms of an athletes recovery and performance and we all have those days when we just don't get enough sleep and that's gonna happen that's real life I've heard you talk though about the importance of keeping a rolling total number of hours of sleep can you elaborate on that explain what you mean by a rolling total of number of hours absolutely we'd work a lot of the times in imperfect populations in the sense that they live and operate in an imperfect world and so three to four hours or maybe even two hours on on no hours of sleep is it could be a distinct reality and the context we tried to put behind it is if you get limited sleep it's fine you can we've got countermeasures to help support you but if your total for the week is say 35 hours first your rolling total for the week is 50 hours that two or three hours night of sleep depth is going to have a distinct difference between while what your your rolling total is and so when the individual looks at it from that perspective they could get yeah they feel comfortable and being able to replenish that sleep after the case or on the front end preload and get additional sleep where possible in order to keep that that sweet spot following up on the sleep theme and working with NFL players I know that you spent a lot of time ensuring that travel particularly the really long haul flights didn't negatively impact the players performance can you share some of your most effective methods for handling long haul flights and still performing well on the other end yeah there's a few different components to go into this I would say the first is is hydration and travel we would individualize each of the players electrolyte profile and get a good understanding of how much sodium they dumped when they threw through sweat and provide an individual electrolyte solution for them based off that you know what they typically excrete it and so intraflight we would make sure that you know they they achieve optimal hydration based off that profile and the volume they needed depending on the length of the flight and the second thing was to support circulation and yeah this is important both pre-game and post-game and so you know we issued each guy a set of recovery socks and then we compounded that with a firefly and the firefly is a as a non-fotiguing stem device that actually came across in probably the mid to late 2000s in the UK and it you know it was up until a couple years ago I think it got FDA approval for use here in the US but essentially it's a non-fotiguing stem device you put on your perinil nerve just off the off your fibular head and it creates a light circulation of your blood and prevents that that pooling in the in the low extremity that you experienced typically on long haul flights so that feeling of heavy legs that feeling of just fatigue in general fatigue because because the blood is pulled down to your low extremity is mitigated and we found that to be a really useful countermeasure for for guys you know it helps really well with injury and swelling as well and then recovery post-game we found it you know a great tool it's great for long drives too Joe gave me some of those things and my wife and I frequently drive from Pensacola to the mountains of Maine this is a really long drive and I think it was helpful for sure absolutely absolutely working with the Department of Defense as well as professional athletes you must have seen a wide range of body types ability and level of commitment from your experience what are some standout things that high performers consistently do and what are some common pitfalls that you've seen hinder progress the most common red thread that I've seen throughout has been a son amount of consistency and purposefulness and and how people prepare the guys that have had long careers the guys that have gone on in tough environments and continue to take care of themselves and their bodies and ultimately their families through a lot of you know extended periods of occupational stress they consistently do the right things and you know these aren't big necessary impactful things in the moment but that the little and often things is making the right decision consistently with respect to nutrients nutrient quality nutrient timing hydration utilizing recovery strategies and having a good solid routine that you're going to stick to I think it goes a long way what mechanisms do you rely on to gauge the success of any specific intervention that is how do you balance investment it could be time and money for example with performance improvement how does one essentially not waste time or effort and then only make a negligible improvement how do you balance that there's a few things to address I think with that that question the first is the notion of individualization I think there are some certainly generic countermeasures and generic solutions that that can have an impact across a team or group but it's also important to understand the end of one and what works for someone may very not work for the other and it might be in fact maybe the exact opposite and you can take caffeine is a great example while caffeine may be a great resource for pregame or pre workout for one individual and it may have the complete opposite effect for another and based off genetics and how they metabolize and you know the impact it has on the central nervous system I think the second thing to look at is is the cumulative impact of small incremental gains and you know where one thing in isolation may not stand out but when you add up all the small little things and you gain 1% here and 1% there that can have a profound cumulative impact on on a sense of well-being and recovery for an individual and then ultimately that's going to you know roll into performance on game day. So these days technology allows us all to collect an absolute ton of data about ourselves and I know some recreational athletes like to collect as much data as possible but if a person was interested in keeping things simple by collecting a minimal amount of data data that matters what is the data they should be collecting in terms of optimizing performance what would be the most important to look at. I think the most important things to look at is once you've established baselines in any different data point is is it actionable is there something that you can actually help you is you can modify behavior modify the intervention and modify your strategy you know teams and organizations have you know had a number of different experiences over over the last few years of wanting to collect tons of data on players and individuals and that's often highly invasive and you know can count against the culture of what you're trying to achieve especially when you look at imposing on player association restrictions and you know ultimately it's the player's data and they've got to have you know a certain level of access to it and it's important that it's actionable to them as well some of the most invaluable data that we've collected over the time that's helped shape behavior has been sleep and you know the different technologies and certainly the emerging ones to get better looking at distinct components of your not just your sleep or the quality of your sleep and your sleep architecture but even if you take a general look at snapshot of total amount of sleep you've achieved and the amount you've got over a given period suddenly on the lead up to you know important events it could be a critical meeting it could be a critical game it could be a critical practice where you're looking to induce your most most amount of skill when you're looking to develop you know a high level of skill within that that session if you take all the different monitoring tools that are out there if you're not addressing that component of sleep it could be a lot of false positive false negatives ever related to that those physiological systems so morning resting heart rate or a heart rate variability all of those can be distinctly influenced by how much sleep you've had that night and how much sleep you potentially had over over a set period of time so I think that's probably you know when I look at strategies that we go in and support an organization or an individual player with it's what does the sleep look like and because it's without a doubt the most fundamental part of your recovery you mentioned heart rate variability do you see its utility mostly within an individual in other words you see the changes associated with sleep and other activities and it informs you about the state of that person or are you able to meaningfully compare across people do you have any views on that I think it's challenging to look at it compare one person to another what you can compare is deviations from the norm I think that helps give you an indicator of okay they got exposed to this training this day systematically across the population did everyone change or did some guys you know improve and do some guys get worse and then what what recovery strategies they deploy post post training session as well and did that have an impact on whether or not that fully recovered so I think it's challenging to compare one person to another but the the relative change across the population it can be can be looked at for sure in some parts of elite sport as you know folks take countermeasures to increase heart rate variability and you know that makes sense on the surface I wonder if the HRV is serving as a sort of check engine light and you're making the light turn off in other words is it causation or correlation is there underlying issue that's changed their heart rate variability for the worse and you're not addressing the underlying issue but directly addressing HRV and I think the answer is no one knows but you know teams are taking their guys and doing the sensory deprivation floats which often make a big difference and other sorts of techniques for modulating that. Joe any quick thoughts on that? Yeah I think that that's that's accurate and we're we're possible some of the emerging technologies can look at other components of the signal from from your heart not just the heart rate variability as well and I think taking something in completely an isolation and depending on what they're doing at that exact moment in time were they in a true rested state because we found certainly in professional sport often there are a lot of false positive and negative noise associated with the capture of your monitoring and so once we established what we believe to be an ideal scenario an ideal response to different practices and different sessions we actually pull back from the monitoring and you know so we could become less invasive to them and their daily lives and spend more of a time and emphasis on education and the sessions themselves and you know again it's it's a guide it's a tool nothing is absolute and we can improve markers of heart rate variability just through breathing and like you said some of the other countermeasures as well so to rely completely on that without taking context of of exposure and context of sleep I think can be can be challenging sometimes. Lots of folks are training these days for marathons and half marathons and even triathlons and in the past in particular people used to go commonly on long slow runs and try to log 50 miles or 75 miles or even 100 miles in a week but today the advice seems to be shifting towards something having to do with running less and incorporating high intensity briefer high intensity training coupled with resistance training do you have any thoughts on this evolution yeah ultimately it depends on what people are trying to achieve if going on the long run helps them mentally get through the day you know who am I or anyone to take that away from them but from a complimentary standpoint I think when you look at the qualitative work that can be done versus just heavy volumes of of quote unquote work you know should should be taken into into into account and so you see great adaptations with interval training still combined with some longer days but from a resistance standpoint what what you'll find is often people when they train for long distances it's not the the cardiovascular deficit this issue it's the orthopedic issue that comes into play as a result of overuse and so resistance training provide a great tool and countermeasure for tissue tolerance and getting any of the strength and the muscle endurance to be able to tolerate some of the longer runs that you do and the secondary to that look at other complimentary stimulus such as using a dry sauna you find you can get some great cardiovascular benefits coupled with your existing training when we would use that routinely post-practice recommend the guys jump into you know a steam or a sauna continue to get some cardiovascular adaptation post post exercise what are some lessons you've learned if any working with the lead athletes that would also be helpful to the average person i think that like i alluded to earlier consistency is is really important there are no real magic bullets or shortcuts to success people you know didn't achieve great levels of physicality from you know just overnight some are more gifted than other genetically we know that but ultimately if you're looking to to change yourself and your body it's going to come through being smart about learning making sure you you fully understand what it is you're doing and how to tolerate the work and making small incremental gains to this going to help you lead you to that that adaptation you know it's consistency is key and we talk about it you know all the time and that's you know ultimately when you get to that behavior change piece again so Joe now you're here at i-chmc because you tell us what was the connection and what attracted you to your current at i-chmc well back in i think it was 2012 2013 time frame we were looking to support the department of fence with accelerated adaptation to attitude and i came across an article you had written actually on the enhanced warfighter and we led to a series of phone conversations and ultimately a visit where we shared best practices and you know i became fascinated you know with the relationship between not just research looking at the testing and evaluation identifying what can potentially be the best practices for the operational environment and you know that operational integration is very much the the area that i focus on and the abilities to come in and help impact a larger group not just one unit and or a league and not just one team i think you know the opportunity here at i-chmc is is exciting to be able to attack that type of landscape makes sense and glad you're here you're working with i-chmc senior research scientist Peter Newhouse and an entire team of engineers to develop an exercise machine aimed at NASA's use on long duration deep space missions such as a Mars mission would be a good example as everyone knows astronauts are quite susceptible to bone density and muscle loss while in space and exercise is one of the only counter measures and critically important do you see potential commercial uses for an advanced exercise device like this right here on her absolutely i think that's been an exciting part of you know a good chunk of my work here at so far i-chmc is working hand in hand the engineers and the roboticists and the human factors team and combining with the commercialization unit from cobalt when you look at the opportunity within elite sport and rehabilitation and the potential for for home use to have a device that can monitor you evaluate you and provide an appropriate training stimulus for you based on your individual deficit quickly and efficiently is invaluable i think you know when you look at it as a more of a system approach you can step on to the bilateral dual force plates get good indications on your jump profile which can then provide you recommendations on injury prevention strategies and for velocity strategies with the loading it essentially provides a system that can evaluate monitor and train you at any load and speed safely i think that's really important for both injury prevention and performance uses indeed very interesting device joe we've discussed blood flow resistance training previously on stemtocks several times but most extensively with dr. Jim stray gunderson from b strong and i know that you used it with the oakland raiders how have you seen blood flow restriction training benefit the elite population of both special operators and athletes to which you interact it frequently and you see any carryover from those populations with blood flow restriction training to the general population absolutely i think when you look at ways in which you can help facilitate greater adaptation or create a positive environment that creates adaptation in other areas as well with minimal stress that's a win and so essentially with the device it creates a hydrogen ion rich environment that promotes a positive hormonal response and we saw great gains with respect to rehab and reconditioning on joint compromise athletes both upper and lower extremity it was also a way to positively impact the hormonal system you know even in season so to help enhance the recovery strategies from heavy practices in games as well and so great tool loving use it frequently myself and you know i enjoy the relationship we have with the the be strong folks so you've worked with elite athletes smaller on the world of all varieties and your goal has always been to optimize their performance so today's million dollar question is what does joe gones training schedule and what kind of diet do you follow and equally importantly how much sleep do you get great question great question it's a largely variable unfortunately and part of that down is is due to travel some great advice i got when i was a young coach getting into the field was that every coach should have a coach and so i actually employed out very own Mike McCog to to write me some programs ultimately we preached a way trying to build the race car for the race and and now my race is you know chasing after two young girls and you know trying to live a long and productive life and so i think you know gone of the days where i'm going to try and lift as much weight as possible in the gym got a nice little setup at the house and at the house in the garage then consistently getting a good strength stimulus consistently getting some good cardiovascular work and making sure that i'm you know eating appropriately for the energy i expand is is it of critical importance as well i think you know moderation is key and consistency is key and so that's kind of how probably the last you know three or four years i've tried to address it as we've discussed today you've made some major moves both here in the u.s and overseas how is your transition to the Pensacola area been going for you and your terrific family so far it's been outstanding i think ten years ago to the day i had a date with my now wife in Pensacola at Dahmer Blue and you know it was back in 2008 and you know we had the same mother's day brunch ten years later after moving into our to our home here in golf breeze just across the bridge here from Pensacola both the people in the area are all outstanding we're without enjoying it well we're all glad you're here and thank you for the great interview Joe thank you yep a lot of fun good deal stem talk stem talk stem talk stem talk well i'm really sorry that i miss this interview but sounds as if you and Joe had a really good conversation indeed we did as you know i'm very excited about the human performance and resilience team that we've put together here at i.m.c and where you don are a key element Joe has added a dimension that we were missing take for example our exercise technology that we've developed for NASA while our engineers developed new technologies for the device and they do a great job at that Joe is the one who best understands optimized exercise protocols and how the user can most appropriately interact with the machine for optimal results a lot of the work we're doing for NASA and the doD is teaching us things that can one day be applied to the general public as well yeah and that's what makes this work so exciting and if you enjoyed this interview as much as Ken obviously did we invite you to visit the stem talk web page where you can find the show notes for this in other episodes stemtalk.us this is Don Cornagas signing off for now and this is Ken Ford saying goodbye until we meet again on stem talk.
