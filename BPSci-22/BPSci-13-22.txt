There's not enough time for every question I want to share about Schvacher. Thank you. Spotted. A ministry system in formation. Welcome to our city live my name is Frank marches and today we are going to talk about Welcome to our city life my name is Frank Marches and today we are going to talk about exomune Information and we are going to talk about a very interesting system which has been studied using an interesting technique called PDS 70 and the planet is PDS 76 so as you know we have for these city lives is a is a weekly series that we have and we invite Scientists to present the research and today we are very honored and happy to have three of them So let me introduce first of all our first the scientists who is a researcher at University of Grenoble in France and at University of Chile And she's the lead author of the article that was published last week or this week. Hello, Miriam. Miriam Benesti Hello Frank Where are you calling us from in Santiago? So right now in Santiago in Chile? Okay, well, thank you very much for joining us from so far away and and Miriam by on my window here we have Stefano Fakini Stefano is a researcher at European Southern Observatory. Hi Stefano different and you are okay Ramlou I'm in Milan Italy, but I usually work in Munich in there okay and on the third window another researcher, but this time at the center of foster physics That's how about university Richard T. How are you Richard? I find I'm doing well And you are in Cambridge? Yes, I mean Cambridge in the in Massachusetts Okay, I'm in Prague in Czech Republic at the moment child university So we are everywhere in the world and we are welcoming all of you so that we are going to talk about This very interesting discovery. So let's go straight to the point Miriam You articles have been everywhere. I mean it's been mentioned in so many places that I cannot come them even the New York time I heard so tell us what is this discovery? Why is it so important? In the we've been very lucky with the media coverage And so what we found is that we found for the first time Evidence for Silicon planet or this so for materials surrounding a giant planet And in this material moons and satellites will be forming or already being formed And this is something that of course we expected because we know that giant planets have a lot of moons And also we expect them from the article point of view But it is the first time that we can actually really observe and have this unique laboratory to test our surgical ideas So what does that look like? How do you find those this kind of stuff? Okay, let me share some slides So how does it look like it looks like this so we have here an observation that we obtained with the alma interferometer That we chart will discuss later on And what you can see here is that we have a young star here that we cannot see actually in the image surrounded by dust Here and then there is this ring here of material and in between the inner and this outer ring What we have is two planets so pdf 70b and pdf 70c So the planets are not emitted at the wavelengths at which we observe We got this image so we cannot see the planet themselves But we can trace the material around the planets So pdf 70b is orbiting the star Along this orbit and pdf 70c along this orbit here And what we found is this material around pdf 70c that emits in the minimator regime So we could observe it with alma and this is the signature of a circomplanet radius So what we are seeing here is basically the material around the planet the cold material around the planet because we are observing in the millimeter Exactly That's a good transition to my question So how did we discover this in these those planets first And how did we observe this interesting system Yes, so we were actually so before we knew but these planets We of course know that we have more than four thousand exoplanets Around old systems the system that have already lost their the material in which they were born And but we have so we have been observing what we call proto-planet radius So the the environment in which planets are forming so young objects With the age of a few million years And in this this we have found already evidence for the the presence of planets or indirect evidence for example This large cavity that is depleted of material is a natural Consequence of the dynamical interaction of a planet so she panaceous there. It's carving this cavity So we were looking at this disc trying to understand the structure of this disc when we found a blob basically in the image And we look back at the observation and the data that observatories have been Observe Getting for decades And we found that this blob was always there and this happened to be pds7tb So in 2018 using the very large telescope Instruments here we detected the first planet pds7tb which is This was a really great discovery because it was the first time that we could directly image a forming planet And then six months later another planet pds7tc was detected and this time it was detected also with the very large telescope with another instrument called muse Through a tracer of accretion of material onto the planet And once we have found this planet then it was really natural for us to go the next step forward was to look at the Material that could be surrounding this planet and that's why we observe this system with Alma So let's talk about Alma It's a beautiful name first of all because it means south in In Spanish And I don't know if you may I am on the talk about that or maybe we talk Describe what is the instrument is doing exactly So ours really just it's been revolutionary in our field of studying planet formation It's this huge telescope or an array of telescopes really in the aftercumadessa in Chile And basically the main goal of having an interferometer like our most that we want to try and achieve spatial resolution So they're very small so we want to be sensitive to very tiny details On the sky And we know that the details that were sensitive to or the angular resolution of these telescopes is directly proportional to the type Size of the mirror that we're using so the bigger the mirror the smaller details we can see on the sky And when we're looking for things like certain planetary disks we need to really have exquisite detail and resolve very very tiny features And so when you look at the size of telescopes you would need to do that You need to have a telescope which has a dish that's sort of tens of miles in diameter Which is just unfeasable to build as one big mirror So what we do instead is use an interferometer which is where we try and synthesize a large telescope by combining lots of smaller telescopes around the place So without more we have something somewhere between 1450 of these 12 meter dishes which are shown in the lower right here And they're sort of distributed over the the mountaintop in the Chilean desert And these are sort of spreader out so you can either have them very closely packed together There's only few meters between the dishes or we can distribute them over huge ranges So we have up to 16 kilometers distance between various telescopes And so when we observe the next guy each of these telescopes is taking data And then we can combine them in a very special way to reproduce the image that we see is what Miriam saw before And it's really moving to a telescope the size of our mother has allowed us to make these observations Not only we're getting the the resolution to resolve the certain pantry desks which we've been unable to do before They're simply having 40 to 50 of these dishes means that we're collecting so many photons We can really start to see very faint objects And that's also being really one of the major points in this detection is that we need to distinguish this very faint source The certain planetary desk from the very bright surface stellar disk around it So that was a large ring in the image before And Alma has really just been revolutionary in that in the last five years There's been a whole slew of amazing discoveries that have been made Because we now have access to this wonderful facility Yeah, I do remember when this facility was on paper only and how they were promising us Amazing discovery amazing resolution and sensitivity and I must admit Despite the fact that the an amnile optical astronomer I'm very impressed by the results provided by the this two millimeter right It's definitely an impressive facility So why is he located in Chile? Why so and why so high? So we really need um The trouble first astronomy is that we want to try and bypass our atmosphere That's the biggest limitation and what we can do because all the auto vapor and just all the atmosphere that we have to look through is going to attenuate any of the Emission that we're seeing is gonna Um make it look a lot dimmer and it's gonna distort the images that we see So we want to try and remove as much of that as possible And we can do that by getting as high as possible as we can so We have some space-based telescopes um so that removes it entirely But if we need to have a ground-braced facility like with Alma We put it on a mountaintop and that will get it as high as possible Um, so actually that after Kamadazet where Alma is and I think it's the driest place in the world There's so little rainfall that it means that we're Minimizing the effect of any water vapor in the sky that's going to absorb any of the signals that we're trying to observe Good Uh, so before I go to my next questions We have you versus watching us from Columbia Island, Cambridge UK, Colorado, Yorkshire In UK again Florida, Haiti, Louisiana Canada and India, Georgia, USA and Australia so everywhere almost every continent he has been mentioned so welcome We are talking about the discovery of Cocoon around the the planet the exoplanet pds This is the paper that I recommend you have a look on to learn a bit more about this or you can also look at the press for this So you made this a remarkable discovery But what exactly is this discovery please One of you maybe Uh can tell us what exactly can you infer from this tiny blob and this blurry features around Yeah, so What we discovered is um Um some materials so dust material emitting very close to the planet So to go back to the full image that we obtained with Alma So this is what we call the circumstar this so that's that this that is around the star Um in which planets two planets at least two planets because they might be more planets Are carving this big cavity big gap. So it's depleted of material here And then around one planet we found um Significant emission from dust that is associated with the planet that is really collocated with the planet And this does is in a circumplanet or a disk So this disk that is expected through the formation of a planet Through which the planet will accumulate its own mass and a creature its own mass and also form its um atmosphere and um through our discovery what we can say is the amount the minimum amount of mass dust mass that we have in this disk and whether or not it would be enough to form satellites And indeed what we found is that we have at least Three-time the amount of mass needed to form satellites like the moon What we could also say here is how um Constraint the extension of this disk and whether or not it is consistent with all the theoretical predictions And we found that it's it cannot be larger than the distance between the the the Sun and the Earth And that is what is expected actually from all the theoretical models of circumplanet radisk So Sorry, I was new because uh have an ambulance passing nearby So yes from this uh this from this image you infer a lot of information about the system itself um We um I read in the in the news that you have a constraint on the size of the moon uh of on the mass the total mass of the moon as you mentioned But what else can we say about formation of planets and exomune by from one image only and what is kind of the the additional information you will need to extract uh to know more about the system Maybe Stefan or you want to answer the discussion Yeah, so I'm happy to take this um So indeed the uh question you raised is a good one how much can we learn from one system all day But I mean to put this in context again uh as we were mentioning before this the very first observation uh you know humankind uh of material around the planet that is um likely forming moons uh so again this to be clear we didn't detect an exomune But we detected the material that is bound gravitationally bound to the planet that must be orbiting around it Is likely for me moves What's very interesting though to put this one system into context is the similarities that the system has for example with our own solar system So if we mirror you can move to the slide uh comparing this one So if you're looking at the light the size uh of this image uh we uh we drew uh the orbits of the solar system planets you can see in the very inner regions there are the rocky planets Uh and then you have the outer planets in particularly Uranus and Neptune where which are very similar orbits to pds 70 bnc And then we have the kuiper belt uh which is uh you know a belt of Big rocks very big rocks orbiting in the outer region of our sewer system which are comparable To the big ring in the syrucom stellar disk of pds 70 And this system is very peculiar and we can learn a lot from just one of these objects um in particular because we see that this system has two planets to massive planets And we can see for example that the inner discs so the inner regions um of the of the discs thank you Miriam is our very dim They're not very bright And this is because the two planets are acting as a dynamical barrier of the material that from the outer region is expected to migrate inwards And this exactly what happened in our own solar system where the capital Jupiter and Saturn so the pair Jupiter and Saturn Uh, damped the outer material and prevented the inner regions to become very massive And that's why we have the earth you know mercury Venus um earth um and Mars which are very low in mass compared to other planetary systems And we think we're seeing exactly the same mechanism in act you want this system Again the last similarities that the central star is the master is very similar to the one of the Sun So somehow with obvious difference is what we are seeing um in analogy of how our own solar system worked and theoretically this telling us a lot About how this starvation works The fact that it's your planetary disk that was uh expected theoretically we finally see it so that's the the first observational confirmation of a theoretical prediction um and so there is a lot to learn about this one system But again the hope for the future is that with these uh fantastic facility alma but with also other ones in particular with uh the James Webb space telescope Which will be launched uh in a few months and in the future with the 40 meter class telescopes like ELT um and easo Will be able to see more and more of this planet while they are being born And the four characterized more and more circumplanned are disks in other systems And so this uh one of the many things we plan to do in the future Yeah, I think it's remarkable that we are seeing probably here Uh a picture of how of made our own solar system when it was only six million years old Maybe not exactly but two giant two giant planets like in our own solar systems So by studying those as you mentioned we can basically understand the past of our own solar system And maybe in the center here one day with one of these new facility we may see something interesting into the Something kind of a proto-war so something like that as well man We may not reach the sensitivity, but that's a wishful thinking Um, we have people joining us from Bangladesh, Massachusetts, Romania and Puerto Rico. Welcome and Texas as well Welcome. We are talking about the circum planetary discolorn PD-S-70C Um, we are going to take some questions from you from the audience here So if you have uh if you want to ask some very interesting questions to our three researcher here was being involved in this research Please let us know and that we start with the first question Someone ask maybe you could stop sharing the screen so we can see the four of us together And someone ask how far away is this system? He's and how is this system and how did how do you know the side the age and the distance of the system We want to take this question first question I'm gonna have a minute. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'll take it so um in the system is about for um hundred light years from earth Uh the way we know the the distance of the system from us uh is through It's basically we can see yearly that the star moves just a little bit in the sky And through a method that we call parallax We can associate this moving this moving in the sky which is Driven by the movement of the earth around the sun. So the sky moves a little bit Uh we can associate to a very uh accurate and precise distance And uh so we we know this uh very well and um We know this distance of the two planets just because by knowing the system the distance from the star to the earth The distance in the sky we can associate it with physical distance between the planets And the central star and that's about the inner one pdf 70b is about 22 20 Astronomical units which is the distance from the earth and the sun and pdf 70c is about 30 33 roughly Astronomical units from the star So um So that's how we know the distances but there was Maybe another part of the question that I missed. How about the age? How do you know the age? medium So there are tracers of i mean the age is a very difficult parameter to constrain and usually you have a very large arrow bar to the The estimate of the age and So For example that one has we say it's about five million years old, but it could be actually three or seven eight It's really difficult to estimate in general. We have tracers for example through um line in emission lines And that can tell us about the age of the system for example Or we relate the position of the star to the position of other stars in the same cluster For which we can estimate the age through different tracers Another way for example to do that is to look at simply at the luminosity of the objects and try to reconstruct the History of just the the the star Through the comparison with models evolutionary models But all of this is really really uncertain So when we say the star is young is because we know that it is young for the fact that it has a circumstal art disc Because we know that circumstal art disc actually disappears within a few million years So usually between two and ten million years the material around the star has dissipated So we know that it is this roughly after a few million years old Okay, thank you Richard we have a question about This image so this is not an image This is built by a interferometry so someone asked what can you give us a bit more details about This the mechanism to build this image how you really concretely do it. I'm assuming you use computer Yeah, maybe you don't maybe you don't maybe you paint it right now Yeah, so that's a good question and I think this is really one of the big challenges in this project was create that image So if you think about a traditional telescope on the works primarily say in optical wavelengths They work in a very similar way to how a digital camera would work So on your mobile phone So you just have a detector that you can take an image of the sky and then you get an image directly And as I said without what we can't do that because you need a telescope that was 16 kilometers wide And so we have to build up of separate images And the way that we combine these images is sort of analogous to Imagine if you're trying to record a piece of music So a traditional telescope would just record the music as you hear it with an interferometer We're only able to hear certain notes of that music So the analogy is that on the sky we can see set spatial frequencies So for a music we can only hear very set tones or notes that we hear Once we combine all these data together we have a good idea of what the source should look like on the sky So we know for example that it should be smooth. It should have certain sort of structures Then we can use that information that sort of discrete samples to reconstruct a model that we would expect to see on the sky based on what we've measured So this is a very big challenge in this sort of imaging Domain and I think a really good example of this is the event horizon telescope So if you saw the recent discovery of them of a collaboration imaging a Disc around a black hole that's exactly the same sort of technique where you're combining all these data sets And you're using various different image synthesis methods to combine those signals from all these different telescopes So you know very well how they're distributed to reconstruct this image And so a lot of testing goes into making sure that the assumptions you make and that reconstruction all the images are robust So for this work we have to go through all different variations of how we could recombine this data How we can wait different data sets differently to show that no matter what we chose what assumptions we made The detection of the circumplanatory disk around pds 70 c was really robust for that So there is yeah, there is some an algorithm behind it But you test different hypotheses to confirm the existence of this structure by By changing them and in every case is you show probably in the paper to the referee that you get This this structure around Around the planet no matter what exactly we have a really nice gallery in the paper showing all these different Realizations at different assumptions that go into it and you can see that pds 70 c Sort of changes size slightly from different assumption to assumption, but the signal is always there All right Okay I have a question here sorry. I mean I was thinking about this paper at the same time Yeah, what is it? So Would you be a ball? That's a question I had too and probably but will you be able to see the equation process in action for proto rocky planets You have the sensitivity basically for that and the resolution So right now to find proto rocky plans now we it's Impossible with the current instrumentation, but that's really what we want to do with the extremely large tiescope that is currently being built in Chile so In for the what we call the ELT X familiar to South Dakota will be first light instruments or the very first one that will Look at this inner region so really the inner this that I was showing in the beginning Where we expect rocky planets And so we will look first for the signature of these planets indirect signature of this planet in the disk as we were doing for the giant planets Then with the second generation its rotation We will actually with for example, we call extreme adaptive optics be able to really specially resolve these regions and look for these planets with high sensitivity So that's something that we are of course aiming for in the next 10 20 years Hi So I have some questions and you can give me a very short answer, okay First question will the would the event horizon telescopes be able to take a closer look on this system? Unfortunately not that would be fantastic, but the difference in how bright the objects are that we're looking at is A billion the black hole disk the event horizon telescope looked at was a billion times brighter than what we're looking at and so we just don't have the sensitivity Hey, how long does it take to take an image like you show us wow how many hours of telescope have you been used to do this? I think for this particular image um in total was about 12 hours 10 to 12 hours of alma time um But we are we're getting more and more data. So we have you know other 15 hours of data that have just come to us So we'll want to look more into it So did you request the telescope time to observe specifically this target? Or did you of this target is part of a large program or you have multiple of targets? Now when we when we discovered the planets pds 70b so in 2018 this target this the disk was part of a large program where we were observing many disks because we want to find We know that we have young planets in this so we want to find all of them basically Uh, but now that we have found this proto planets and there there is only these systems so far that has this we have Both ongoing this big service where we want to find more proto planets and also now all the dedicated studies to really good Really deeply into the understanding of this system. So now we are requesting a lot of time on this specific system And thanks to this discovery. I'm assuming is gonna be probably easier to get the rest of time Well, um, I hope yes, but it's uh, you know the the application to telescope time time is anonymous now No, we don't know who is applying for the time, which is uh Fair uh, so everyone can use the the beautiful image and apply for more time, which is a great thing Hi, yeah true is also not doing an only most of the in the future of course there will be more observational this system whether it will be from our team or another team We will know much more So um you mentioned jdwst so can you tell us more what instrument You you you will you use to get information about this specific system of this specific cocoon on pds 17tc with jdwst You have an idea already I can take it as I think so um there are different instruments on jwst um So pds 17 will be observed in two different programs that we call gto so there was some time allocated um also specifically for the system because um again, it's so interesting and i think it's going to be observed with three different instruments one is called near cam Which is uh going to take in image uh probably around five micro range so in the infrared And again the what's new about jdwst compared to other instruments we're using is that it's going a little bit to longer wavelengths where the the emission of off from the planet will peak So this will boost significantly our ability to see and characterize planets in general So they will use near cam they will use uh miri which is in the medium-fred And um i think they will also look at it with near-spak which is a spectrometer in the new infrared to look for um emission lines for example uh coming from the two planets to try to understand the Maybe in the far future the composition of their atmospheres Good And uh miaya you mentioned the the 40 meter telescope and adaptive optics So you are looking forward to use one of these extreme aeolum assuming Yes, so we i think the pd70 will be observed by every instrument From now and now on basically um so with the extreme enlarged telescope probably will observe it with um i'm having mikaeddo we will also observe it with the metis instrument And at the longer time we with the what's it called the pcs instrument which which which will be really dedicated to um look at terrestrial mass planets um with extreme adaptive optics But before that we will still use alman to characterize the system because now that we have found the circumventry this we still have to characterize it and understand that physical and chemical conditions around it and in the second planetary this So that's been accurate you sorry that's me gonna try to observe a different wavelength for instance to get some kind of cold temperature Exactly so yeah, so we're going to look at different wavelengths to characterize for example the properties of the dust grains that we have seen there try to measure their sizes try to measure their ability to grow to study to small satellites And we will also look at the gas because so far we have this observation in the dust But we want to understand the 3D motion of the gas around the planet and also the the chemical content of this gas and maybe Stefan can say a word about this yet Yes, so indeed we have um available data i mean some of them i got literally 12 hours ago my laptop so i'm gonna check them very soon um so the two channels and ways we're um moving forward to is the first one is again the kinematics so i'm really understanding how the planets interact with their circumstellar and this can possibly even trying to detect the kinematics or signature of rotation around the two planets of gas and this will be super important because it would be like a benchmark to understand how the the dynamics of the planet this interaction because then we can um you know learn how these works and then use it to interpret other systems where we don't see the planets but we see the kinematical signature of planets and the second thing is again characterizing the chemistry as Miam was mentioning we have a program um so we had the paper published already but a low angular resolution now we just got some high angular resolution data a little bit lower than the image we show here because gas is difficult to image but we are tracing a large variety of uh most organic um molecules fairly small but we already have signatures that the material that is likely to be a pretty mild to planets and thus forming their atmosphere is actually chemically evolved for example the carbon to oxygen oration is particularly high and this has a lot of consequences of the kind of atmosphere these planets are going to have and we will be able to do uh these again with thanks to Alma thanks to the incredible sensitivity of Alma to rotational emission lines of different molecules excellent wow the future is bright for the system i'm expecting maybe a very special issue one day on this uh second planet is a planetary system and probably a book will come right so we're gonna hand it here but i have one more question for you for for the three of you i would like you to answer this question as briefly but it's not only about science i want to know a bit about uh how how did you feel when you got this discovery maybe the one who saw the image first for extent maybe you can tell us the story and uh what's the next step in your career you want to start Mia is your my double left here yes um so we had uh the we had observed this system since we discovered the planets so this was already in general very exciting we knew we were going to find something exciting and then a year ago we had um evidence for the presence of dust around this planet and this observation that we observe we obtained were really um the booming confirmation of its presence so when we found it of course we were really really really excited um but what is what has been really nice i think in in this project is that we have been working closely in a really very very nice and friendly team and that has you know like the beautiful aspect of this project in general is that we have been learning a lot and collaborating um through this you know international collaboration um and also the through the work of a PhD student so in general the human history around this project has been really pleasant and beautiful and the next step is um for me to go back to Europe so i've been sabbatical for four and a half years in Chile and right now i'm looking forward to move back to to Europe so you're going back to Grenovo Ro yes yes thank you very good uh what about you Richard so i think when i first saw the image it was just absolutely amazing to see that we could really detect what what we're hoping to see i mean we've had sort of a decade of predictions of people saying this is what certain pantry discs should look like so to see that first hand the the data is showing exactly what people had predicted that was really exciting and i think i really want to echo merriam's comments that this was a really excellent collaboration um everyone was very friendly and we spent so long trying to verify the results to make sure that what we're seeing was really amazing to have so many different experts all bringing their own expertise and to really test all the different assumptions we were making so we could really be as certain as we could so we were seeing what we were hoping we were seeing hey and what are the next steps for you um so i'm going to be staying around the us for a little bit so i'll be moving to MIT actually next year and so i'm going to continue looking at how how we can use our work to sort of understand the initial stages of fan information to really understand what the building blocks are of these planets whether we can start to do this in different systems and to understand um how we can connect that to what we see in our own solar system good and uh same question for you stepano yeah so it's difficult to answer after the two answer my mirroreds of course but um i mean i agree with them sometimes in our job i think we're so mean we tend to like get used to these beautiful outstanding images but sometimes it's so beautiful to take a step back and realize how just uh beautiful and outstanding it is that we are observing dust that is likely to form moons around the next sub planets that is for um you know 400 light years away and we're able to to die to see it and we are the first human beings in history that are doing this and this is just um you know mind blowing literally and so to take a step back i think has been um i'd be really really really happy and proud to do that and let me also say that to see how people uh and also known astronomers reacted to the press release we had and see how odd uh and um moved they were off the out of the beauty of this image really struck me and really gave me a boost in you know realizing how beautiful the job i do is and also that we were able to offer this kind of image to everyone uh and so that everyone can really enjoy the beauty of the sky and um and again i also eco both uh mirrored and returning saying how beautiful it has been to work together on this particular project um now you see the beautiful image but is i think also had is it's challenging times because the idea required a lot of technical uh work um and it's not always super fun but still we persevered and at the end we're very we're very happy how we helped each other in the process so uh i'm really happy i was part of the team good so you are going to stay in that at iso for a while no now i'll be moving in uh from the beginning of September i'll actually uh go back to where i studied so i'm moving back to Milan uh to to to start your position here wow everybody is moving the world of science right yeah i do remember this time okay guys well thank you very much thank you me i am thank you stefanot thank you richard thank you very much thank you to all our viewers um very happy we have put this uh city life together frankly that was something i really wanted to do this week uh before leaving europe so i'm glad we we had an opportunity to talk about i think uh one of the best discovery of the year but the year is not over yet so maybe something else will come but i'm of course very biased because you know a studio exoplanets and i like imaging so and i live in shiles and i work at european thousand observatories so of course i'm biased but uh yeah it's a very it's an amazing discovery and a great um i think it a great step in the study of exoplanets and understanding how we turn form planets and moons around us so thank you to all our viewers for watching us this was the city life and as you know the city life is uh conducted is led by the city institute a non-profit organization located in mountain view california but we are everywhere in the world as you can see uh we are going to have a city talk in august to talk about the definition of life so if you want to hear about what is life and understand what is life uh follow our website we're gonna make an announcement pretty soon um if you are inclined you can follow us of course on twitter youtube facebook very scrup now doesn't exist anymore um twitch uh anywhere we are everywhere we have a website www.sati.org and you can get our newsletter know about what's going on in the in the search for life in the study of the universe of course and if you are inclined uh click here and here and make a small donation even five cents you will help us he will help us to uh to travel back to california in my case and to all this researcher to do this amazing research he at the city institute and elsewhere in the world so thank you very much have a good day evening afternoon wherever you are on this planet and see you next week maybe bye bye
