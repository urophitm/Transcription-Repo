Hello everyone and welcome to Talk Nerdy. Today is Monday, January 27th, 2025. And I'm the host of the show, Dr. Cara Santa Maria. And before I dive into this week's episode, before I thank those of you who make Talk Nerdy possible, I want to apologize for not having a new show up last week. The horrific fires here in Los Angeles really affected everyone in different and I guess just intense ways. And so during that time when they were on-going and everything was very touch and go and there were problems with even just maintaining our electricity or our internet service, I just thought it best to kind of take a pause and not push too hard. So I wasn't able to get a new episode up last week, but I am very excited about this week's episode. And I'm also very grateful for all of you who reached out to the social media and through other channels to express your concern. And yeah, who are who have angelinos in your minds and your hearts right now. So thank you for that. This week's top patrons, I was about to dive right in. We will get to the new episode in just a second, but remember that Talk Nerdy is and will always be 100% free to download and the way I keep this thing going really the only way that I pay for this show is through my Patreon account. So if you're interested in supporting the show right now, it's on an episodic basis. I think they're going to change that model, which means it's probably going to mean a big hit to how we pay for the show. But as of right now, we're pledging on an episodic basis, not a monthly basis. All you've got to do is visit patreon.com slash Talk Nerdy to learn more. And a little note, it's preferable if you use the website. If you don't use the Apple app, because Apple is taking a massive cut from all of the patrons through the app. And so if you're on an iPhone and you still want to use Patreon, don't use the app. Just go to the website and more of that money will go to the creator. So yeah, a quick tip for any of you who are going about it that way. This week's top patrons include Anu Badavaj, Daniel Lang, David J. Eastmith, Mary Neva, Brian Holden, David Compton, Gabrielle F. Haramio, Joe Wilkinson, Joseph Lamore, Pascuali Jalati, Rika Maharaj, and Ulrika Hagman. Thank you all so, so much. All right, so I just, I'm literally just finished the recording. So it's fresh in my mind. I had the privilege of having a wonderful chat with Dr. Eleanor Barraclough. She is a historian, a writer, and a broadcaster based at Bath Spa University. She was, she studied at the University of Cambridge, and she held positions at both Oxford and Durham previously. She's written one previous book and numerous articles for different outlets that you have read. She now kind of spends most of her time presenting radio programs, podcasting. She still does some TV, but she does have a new book out and it is fascinating. It's called Embers of the Hands, Hidden Histories of the Viking Age. So without any further ado, here she is, Dr. Eleanor Barraclough. Eleanor, thank you so much for joining me today. Such a huge pleasure. Thank you for having me. So I'm excited to talk about your new book, Embers of the Hands, Hidden Histories of the Viking Age. And I have to admit, right out of the gate, most all everything about the Viking Age is a hidden mystery to me because it's just an area that I have never spent much time. I don't know why I've never been arrested by the film or the television or that story. And I have friends who are obsessive over this area of history. It sounds like probably you are excited about this time in history, but I don't know why it's never grabbed me. I'm thinking maybe it's because it's always been presented in a very over-the-top kind of way. Yeah, I agree. I think that's exactly it. And that was always for me what I wanted to get away from, almost a sort of cartoon version of the Viking Age. And also, let's not cut ourselves, a really male version of the Viking Age. Yeah, it always just felt like the action movie testosterone for me. And I was like, yeah, that's not for me. I don't know. It never felt like it was for me. Yeah, no, no, I agree. And for me, I came to it from a very different point of view. So I was someone who was always really interested, well, I still am very interested in a lot of different historical time periods, but also storytelling and traveling and really wild and sort of exciting parts of the world where stories are told about humans in different ways because they've had to live in different ways in these places. And so I came to it first as someone who had got to explore, but not enough, the extraordinary landscapes of the far north of Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland, the Arctic, those sorts of places where a lot of, but not all of the Viking Age stories played out, but also through the literature, through the language. That's how it started for me. And that was really it that when I was learning the language, for me, there was such poetry in it. And so I came to it as someone who was looking, looking for the voices, always looking for the voices and the stories and the mythology and the history of these people as told by themselves in their own ways. And that for me was far more interesting than, yeah, as you say, these kind of like big testosterone headline hitters kind of was it like, blokes with bids and boats, basically that never really did it for me. Yeah, it was on their heads. Right. Which they didn't even have. Yeah, this is, this is, see, it's terrible. Every time I do my signature, so if I'm sort of book signing, my signature is so pooling that I've been told that it looks like a slug is tried to crawl across the page and this has died off. So I tend to add a little cartoon of a Viking. And there's no real other way of making it obvious. It's a Viking. If you don't put horned helmets on it, but I've got told off a bit, like people have brought their children up and said, I've just seen your signature. You know they didn't have horned helmets. So which I have to say slightly better I did a book signing a couple of weeks ago. Someone came back to me after I'd signed it. He said, sorry, could you sign the book? I said, I did. And he said, oh gosh, that's your signature. And then he just keep practicing and then high five me and walked out of his, oh, that's a low moment. That's a breeze. To be fair, it's a really bad signature, but now it's a really bad and historically inaccurate signature. But that is so funny. Maybe a good place to kind of dive in right at the top is, and I know it sounds like really, but maybe you could help us understand two things that are probably very important is number one, what is a Viking? Like how do we even define that term? And number two, when was this era help us orient to this time period? This is really important. And I feel that people tend to sort of like talk about Vikings without covering the basics, you know, those basics. And it's in the same way if I, I don't know if I were sort of asking about even sort of really popular big ones like ancient Egypt, I actually find it really difficult to sort of orient myself in time periods and chronologies. So yeah, when it comes to the Vikings, well, the meaning of the word Viking actually also is very much related to the chronology. So that's kind of useful. So Viking, yeah, Viking is actually an old Norse word to start with. It's and it literally just means a raid as it all knows being the language that the Viking spoke sort of medieval Scandinavians as well. So it means a raider or pirate and they've got another version of that word, which is essentially the verb. So sort of you go, you go a Viking, you go on a raid and it tends to be over the summer. So no one's, no one's a Viking all the time to start with anyway, it's, it's an activity, it's sort of a seasonal occupation at best. There's also an old English version of the word so old English being sort of contemporary with the Viking age we were talking about, you know, the people who sometimes are referred to as Anglo-Saxons who sort of lived in England during this period and their version of the word also means pirate and it's reaching. So, you know, if there are some arguments about where that word actually comes from and, you know, who had it first and all the rest of it, but that means that when we sort of take it out a little bit and we think about, okay, when was the Viking age? Well, the most obvious and sort of straightforward way to sort of define the chronology is to say, all right, well then when was the first raid? That can be the start of the Viking age and there's a very famous raid on the island of Lindisfun, which is off the northeast coast of England. It's very close to where I used to live out there and basically there was this very, very wealthy, completely undefended monastery and in the year 793 AD it's attacked by Vikings and this obviously sort of sends shockwaves through England, through medieval Europe people are writing about it. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sort of is written down later, says, you know, never before, you know, here in this year came dreadful portance over the land of the Northumbrians and the people were terrified and there were sheets of lightning and fiery dragons were seen and then the North men attacked. So there's that real sense of shock, but on the other hand, you know, you know what it's like, it's really difficult to say, okay, in this year, on this day, this era began and of course when we, you know, so when you look into it and you kind of dig down, that's also true of the Viking age. So because you have to think, okay, well, that's one raid that we know about and there are texts that sort of indicate there's there's kind of some violence visited upon the people of England or at least a person of England who's sort of killed trying to make the make three ship loads of sort of dames they call them but sort of Scandinavians more generally go and visit the king and that's down on the south coast and that's a couple of years before that. But then you have to think, well, okay, the raids aren't the first thing that happens, something goes before the raids and for example, about 10 years ago, archaeologists discovered in Estonia, so we have to think, okay, Scandinavia being the heartlands of the Viking age, we think about going west sort of the British Isles for example, but we go east and archaeologists discovered this island of Sarama in Estonia and sort of essentially Nordic a Nordic ship and a Nordic boat from Sweden from close to what's now Stockholm and dating from around 750s, so that's nearly 50 years before that raid and it's got dozens and dozens of people who've been killed violently, who've been buried in it, who are sort of from Sweden as we think of it now and it looks like they were maybe going east to sort of open up diplomatic links, sort of established trade routes, which is all very much part of the Viking age too, so do you not mean it, it is it's tricky but yeah we can say sort of 8th century, we can say 2nd half of the 8th century perhaps, but who knows what other evidence is, is still there waiting to be discovered and then of course we've got the same problem at the other end, right, we've got one to say end and one date that's often used is 1066 because that's when sort of everything kicks off in England and King Harold Godwin's in the last Anglo-Saxon King is sort of he goes up to York and he kills Harold Hardrada who's the king of Norway at that time and who's sort of mounting an invasion and trying to stake his claim to the throne, but then of course we know that Harold Godwin's in himself gets killed by William the Conqueror, he's come over the Normans and so you know that whole historical period sort of tips over into something else, but again a bit like Lindisfan, that's a really I don't know sort of Anglo-centric way of thinking about history because you know it's there's everything else is still going on. Because those were the texts, those were the texts that people originally not people, but those those who were writing the texts were reading those texts, and that's what we learned in school and I think that's how the history perpetuates for sure. Yeah exactly and there are other texts and other sorts of evidence, you know archaeological evidence and so on from other parts of this very wide sort of it's sometimes called now the Nostiaspora, this kind of very broad cultural sphere that ends up you know they're settling in Greenland for nearly 500 years, you know they're up you know in the far north in the Arctic they end up sort of establishing whole civilizations down the sort of waterways the steps of Eurasia in what's now Ukraine, Russia and so on. So and then of course they're in Byzantium you know which is now Istanbul in Turkey but then was this sort of glittering empire and they even end up in Baghdad in what's then the Islamic caliphate so all those different places have different timelines do you know or it's either connected but and even if I mean we say Anglo-centric even if we just go north over the border to what's now Scotland we have the Battle of Lags and that's sort of almost exactly 200 years after the Battle of Stanford Bridge in 1066 when Harold Hardrad is killed, Battle of Lags it's still the Scottish King and the Norwegian King fighting it out for territory in the Hebrides and then go to the Northern Isles and so sort of still talking British Isles but that's now Orkney and Shetland so off that northern coast of Scotland well they belonged in Norway until until sort of 1468 or something where they're sort of handed over to the Scottish King as part of a dowry so do you know what I mean it's sort of it's so much more complicated which is also so much more interesting it is good I think we think of quote people like A people as either a geographic group or an ethnic group or both and I think that's why this sort of Viking history is complicated to a layperson because we're like okay well but who were they where were they from and then we're like are they a whole people or were they an occupation within a people? Yes yeah and that's that's why that word diaspora is actually quite useful because if we think of the Scandinavian homelands as essentially being where it all kicks off that's fine so we've got Norway Denmark and Sweden but it's this idea that that that a sense of a diaspora in that there is still as these people spread out and sort of discover new lands colonise new lands but not necessarily in the way that we might think of colonisation although sometimes yes you know they they settle in lands that are empty they embed themselves within other cultural groups and in time become something much more resembling those cultures and that's particularly the case when they're sort of interacting in the east with Slavic cultures but you know for for a lot of it for example ilikerts Iceland and Greenland they're still talking this language you know that we started with Old Norse and they're still looking back to their homelands essentially they're still connected to Norway in particular Denmark Sweden when they're facing east so it's not it's not that the whole thing is this horrible mess where you just can't sort of get a handle on any sort of truth or you know it's like well okay these people even related after a point at the point where Norse Greenland comes to an end and we're talking you know first half possibly of the of the 15th century almost so we think of that timeline going from yeah kind of late 8th century all the way up to sort of the 15th century and they're still talking it seems a form of Old Norse and they're still very much looking back to these homelands and no one's quite sure what happened in terms of okay why did this come to an end there are all sorts of factors not least things like climate change it gets a lot colder there's a lot more ice the roots the ceiling it's sailing roots become a lot more dangerous but that's part of the reason for the collapse is that they need those connections because they're still very much part of that sphere so when I think about and forgive my ignorance but places like and it's so funny because I'm actually going on a vacation tomorrow to Iceland so I'm very excited yeah great great yeah but the when I think about Iceland and especially Greenland but but definitely Iceland as well they don't have or maybe I'm wrong here they didn't have an indigenous population these were places where people were not right yeah so certainly in the case of Iceland yes so there's it's there's a sort of little hint and I think it's quite plausible that there were people who were there when these sort of the first Icelanders turn up so Iceland is kind of traditionally said to be settled from around eight seventy one plus or minus a couple of years and the wonderful thing is there that the texts from medieval Iceland you know written a few centuries later tell us this but also essentially a volcano goes off in Iceland just really really just before the first settlers arrive and so we can date that volcanic layer we can date the Teferra and you can see around most of Iceland that there is settled sort of so rather coastline those first settlements are almost directly on top of that Teferra layer which is a wonderful thing you know where some different types of evidence come together but the texts that tell us about this settlement also say a group that they call the Papa like PAPAR AR were there but they didn't want to live amongst the pagan Norse who've sort of come over from Norway and also the British Isles particularly the women and so they leave and they leave behind sort of bells and crowsiers and books and so the idea there is that they are Christians they're sort of part of this sort of Paragrinatsuio tradition where holy men particularly from sort of Ireland and that Celtic fringe they set out to find places of solitude um essentially they're not indigenous yeah these are I mean they're Christian they're pretty modern yes exactly and the thing is I mean this would if if they were there this this would have been an absolutely tiny group and it's not like they can sort of how do I put it nicely sort of replicate themselves and so it's not sort of a social community in the way that you would think about an indigenous population absolutely not the case with Greenland is slightly more complicated because certainly there are plenty of groups historically who did occupy different parts of Greenland but at the period when the Norse arrived so we've got to think sort of the Norse end up settling the lower part of the west coast of Greenland essentially up to modern day nuke you know the capital and there's also there's a lot more of Greenland beyond that and obviously we know there's a lot of the interior that you know it's covered in ice and so it really isn't inhabitable certainly not for sort of medieval European farming and hunting population and but at the point where the Norse arrive and if Iceland is settled from around 871 then the Norse arrive in Greenland around the year 985 or so and it's it you know it's we can talk about that if you because this that's like the story very the red and from Greenland it's almost like a jumping off point where they end up exploring part of the coastline of North America so it's the most incredible story um but that's yeah so that's quite a lot later and although there are no indigenous people they've kind of you know they've stopped living in that part centuries earlier um but what we then find is that there are other indigenous groups that cross who are sort of the ancestors of today's sort of in your Greenlanders um and they cross from Canada and they come down that west coast and we know that yeah so so it's a tricky one it's not like is that one is connected to this larger population yes North America exactly exactly and so you we know that there are interactions there are Norse texts that describe just sort of little hints of those interactions we also have kind of very small bits of evidence the indigenous populations coming from the North to the south have occasionally sort of carved faces that look very much like that long-nosed European type sort of the Norse faces it would have been then and it's been suggested that that is a sort of that's an artistic representation of these encounters it's not like for example when they tip up in England and they want to settle which is sort of after this raiding period well there's people they're already so there's a jostling should we say although again it's not quite clear the nature of that jostling that's something that archaeologists are continuing to sort of uncover the story of but yes in the case of the of the far west from a Norse perspective it is a different story it's fascinating to think that there were just no people on Iceland I don't know why that's a hard thing for me to believe but I guess it's true nobody bothered to go there yeah well and also it's just I mean for me it's always the sheer sort of practicality of okay so you've got a bow and you know what it's I mean even if you're I'm assuming flying there tomorrow you know and you'll just see you know there's so much sea there's so much water and you know what the North Atlantic's like it is not the most forgiving calm body of water so I also find extraordinary if the the group they call the papar these sort of Christian hermits essentially did end up there you they'd have been they'd have been traveling in these tiny little coracles that's terrifying I just I hate to think how many of them didn't make it you know it's it's true yeah yeah ships as well so there's a there's a really interesting description of the first ships that set out from Iceland to get to Greenland when they decide they're going to settle there and it says of I don't know maybe 24 ships or something around half of them don't make it they're either driven back to Iceland or their ship racked you know lost oh jeez I think it's almost more extraordinary that people do make it out to Iceland that they did me yeah that's true it's funny because I often think about these like very very ancient you know indigenous populations spreading around to all of these Pacific islands but but it's yeah it's a different sea that's but it was so early that that these people decided to you know fling themselves around the globe and and find new lands and so it's always interesting when I hear ah really this was like you know seven eight nine hundred years after the common era that's wow that's late that's yeah that's it so Iceland is one of the last major land masses sort of that to be settled when the North arrive but I think it's it's also it's a true from New Zealand that's even like there's this suddenly you know bigger land masses that are settled even later and a lot of it is just sheer you know practicality and yeah I find I'm talking from I work in this tiny little potting shed you know that in London and I have next to me this this really cute little sort of wooden Viking ship that I stole that in my children's bedroom because I mean it's it's far too nice to be told yeah and it's got these little people in it and it's all very sort of cute but quite often when I'm in here and I'm writing you know researching I look at it and I just think oh my goodness what this rep presents this little ship in terms of what people are actually doing oh absolutely it's extraordinary I would not be brave enough you know I get horribly seasick I'm sort of such a bad Viking historian I'm vegan and I get seasick it's really embarrassing I was just recently and I was looking it up while we were talking I was just recently in Stockholm and I visited the Vasa which is much later right this is like 1626 but this was a a warship a Swedish warship and it's like perfectly preserved that's why it's so incredible because because of the way it sunk in the I don't know the chemistry of the water and it whatever it was perfectly preserved which is incredible but I felt those all those same feelings you're talking about looking at this ship which is not even that old and I was like no thank you yes this is never want to live on this I just yeah I think I think yeah five minutes in the Viking age and I'd have probably been sort of outlawed for just pure incompetence but then again I mean it was it was thanks to outlawry that Eric the Reds sort of ended up discovering Greenland and then founding this settlement you know he gets he starts off in Norway and this is kind of yeah second half of the 10th century starts off in Norway he gets outlawed for killings as they put it nicely and then he moves to Iceland and he starts another feud there of course he does very Viking and then he gets outlawed from there but only for three years and then he obviously thinks oh goodness well I've exhausted all my options back east I'm as well head west and so he he ends up exploring the the the fjords of the west coast of Greenland for three years and then it's it's him that comes back and gathers up his friends and his followers followers and says all right out we go let's see what we can and again I think that's an incredible it's like your you I mean Greenland is is not as everyone always says and it is said in the sarcasm oh Eric basically called it Greenland to encourage people to settle there is what the sargars tell us but I mean I I've done quite a lot of research out there and in the summer oh the bits they settled beautiful that's it green and rolling hills and absolutely gorgeous the problem just comes that the winters are so long and hard and you know so yeah again I just decided to visit Iceland in the middle of January I know but you might get the Northern Lights that's why it's going yeah thing I mean it's not the only reason I'm going but yes it's a good reason it's as yeah no I love that time of year I remember I was um I was working up in Svalbard once and it was January and I think that was my part and I know plenty of people live there and love it but I loved it while I was there but I remember being on the plane on the way back and seeing the sun essentially sort of rise because we were traveling south I've never been so grateful to see the sun okay that's my limit apparently exactly it's brutal and I mean it's funny because you know we speak about brutality we talked we opened this conversation talking about the um stereo types of the Viking age and the Viking people and in a way we can see why that stereo typing exists I mean it's based on the language this was a pirate people these and we were talking about conquest and murder and all of these things but yeah but the Vikings weren't just dudes right they would have died out pretty quickly so so it makes me wonder what what were the people who weren't doing the plundering you know in the killing were they also Vikings and where were they what were they up to so yeah this is it and this is so much of what I wanted to sort of explore in in the book and visit the hands because exactly that it's oh come on you you weren't all doing that you society would have collapsed and like I said even the people who were on these raids well most of the year most of them were farmers you know you can't you can't just survive going around rating in fact in the sagas the stories that have written down in Iceland about the Viking age sort of you know from the 13th century but they have very long oral roots they're not they're not hugely complimentary about people who carry on doing Viking raids and really they should have grown up a bit and settled down it's always a little bit embarrassing you know it's like someone's sort of slightly aged uncle who's still going out partying whenever everyone else is like oh really so yeah that's the first thing to know the second thing though is that I so there's one really I really enjoy the fact if we're just thinking about well okay so the the tricky thing is when we're talking about well what was everyone else up to of course it sort of comes back to what we was talking about in the beginning this is a huge chronological period of sort of several centuries but it's also really diverse sort of I say a diverse cultural group in some ways yes in some ways no but you know it's really quite spread out and so what this culture represents for someone for example living in sort of cave during the period where it's very much sort of Scandinavian run and and founded is going to be and that's maybe 900s or something it's going to be really different if you're for example a hunter up in Arctic Greenlands trying to get walrus so you can sort of harvest the ivory in the skins and sell it and and you know make enough money and bring enough things in to keep your farmstead going so that's one thing but then of course it's also true that yeah exactly as you say there's there's a load of of course there are men but even if we just talk about the men there are men at the top of the pile and the bottom of the pile and there are old men and young men and sort of enslaved men and all sorts of things that we have to think about there and then well the same as just as true of the women except in a way you know even if you're a woman at the top well you're most of the time not going to be as top as the men who are the equivalent of you and so you know there's lots of different layers to break down and part of what so the so sort of in the book I actually really struggle I knew what I wanted to write about and I knew the sort of evidence I wanted to look for which was essentially I think I see I call it sort of the little bits and pieces the ephemera of life that sort of slip between the cracks in the floorboards of history you know and survive down to the present day you know it's so like archie like real archeological evidence yeah yeah physical objects exactly exactly and very very intimate ones but also kind of often very everyday ones so you know children's drawings or the spindle walls the weights that would be used in textile production that often had the names of the women who owned them sort of carved in runes at the bottom or you know kind of gaming pieces things like the do you know things that give us a sense of that rounded picture that was that was what I was interested in but what I really struggled with and sort of the irony here is that when I wrote my first book which was about it's called Beyond the Northland it's about the sort of far travelers of the Viking world and the stories that they brought back and turned into sagas so the irony there is that the easiest thing about that was structure because I decided I'll do basically north south east of west let's keep it simple but when you're trying to sort of I suppose you must sort of reach out in time and try and find that the ordinary everyday humans of the past but in a way that isn't sort of you know you're not telling their stories in an ordinary way because I mean certainly I would get quite bored of that quite quickly it's like why would you extraordinary in yourselves it was really tricky to structure and I ended up doing it thematically and so you know there's chapters on love and religious belief and play and what home means and sort of what it means to be free or not free or you know you know the sort of sort of things that we can still relate to today but absolutely do you know what I mean it's like I have people yeah exactly yeah but there is a trap there in there and this is this is a really tricky historical trap which is exactly as you say they're people and so you start to look at these objects and you think oh I've got the equipment of that yeah I get you I see you you know of course you know what's that that cliche you know the past is a different country and it's it's a different universe a lot of the time and again that goes back to what you were saying at the beginning it is relatively speaking it's a brute-lage it's a short-lived age it's an age where there are very different codes of contact conduct in different ways of being in the world and so there's always that there's always that great unknowability um for me I love that I really love I love trying to write um from the point of uncertainty um because I you know I don't know if you you've probably had conversations like this on the podcast before but I have because yeah yeah not so much from I mean yes sometimes from a writing perspective but I guess my side of it is as a psychologist a clinical psychologist so much of what I work with my patients on is being in the gray being in the unknown and sitting I work in a cancer center right it's all about uncertainty and how do we find comfort in the not knowing how do we exist in that space exactly that and and I mean I remember very when I was at university I I you know I basically chose the as I think I put it at the time the weirdest degree I'm gonna find the weirdest degree to do and it's cool it really was it was beautiful and luckily I'm weird too so I stayed until I finished my PhD as well I was like yep I found my weird home that it's called Anglo-Saxon Norton Celtic and so it covers sort of what we traditionally think of sort of the dark ages and it's the literature the languages the history the the sort of anthropology and all these things of sort of a set of cultures in and around the first millennium CE essentially around kind of Western Europe but also very much expanded because no no cultural area is an island but I remember at the time finding it really difficult because I'd sit in lectures and I'd think oh these these these people they and not just the lecturers but also the other students I think they know they there's an answer and I'm just missing the answer and I don't I don't know why I don't know why it doesn't feel straight forward to me and I actually I struggled with history more than I struggled with languages and literature because languages and literature it's sort of particularly with literature you know sort of built into it that it's going to be subjective and but with history I always felt well history is dates and it's people and it's reasons things happen and you know if I don't quite understand them all yeah exactly yeah and it took me years to understand it's like oh no it's okay it's okay the gray areas are where it's sort of yeah exactly is as with with yourself it's where the humanity happens yeah you know and it I found I found some of these books some some sort of some some of the chapters or some of the themes within them quite when I say difficult to write I mean I'm someone who has always written for a living and I was always found it difficult so that's a whole other you know I really I really remember people who sit down and they just like oh yeah I just I just knocked out another chapter I always think they're lying like I'm with you I don't write for a living because I don't enjoy writing I have written but it's so hard yeah well see no I'm but I mean I'm I'm married to someone who he also writes this part and he does he just he does it for fun he does it me I'm in whatever I know you know you're in yeah I would I mean I would hate him if he wasn't so delightful as a human but yeah I'll go to bed and I'll be sort of watching whatever it's sort of brain-rotting TV program I'm trying to sort of turn my brain off with you know absolute dross and he's he's sort of in the other room in the city I'm just just making these beautiful worlds in his mind he's just like it's just really nice it's always a struggle but then there was this other struggle that sort of went into this which was and it comes back to the gray areas that often when you're looking for ordinary humans the stories are not always nice and by definition if you're writing about history you're writing about sort of not to sort of get too more bit but you're writing about death a lot of the time and that's I actually I find that really hard I find writing trying to find the individuals of history and writing about that sense of kind of mortality and loss and when you're looking for emotion that was why I you know I have chapter three on love loving sort of all sorts of ways that that can sort of be interpreted and I end with these pictures by this this small child who's sort of living in Novgorod but after sort of when it's no longer a Viking place it's no longer really Scandinavian sort of in terms of its cultural inflection you know it's very much Slavic but I really struggled writing that because you know it's so medial looking at these pictures done by this small child in a sort of essentially in a classroom and do you know what I mean it's it's it's a hard thing to look at and I do but I also it's funny because I because I work in a cancer center because I work an end of life and specializing that area I read and focus on mortality and death a lot and I confront it a lot and I do find that for most human beings there is an avoidance and an intensity there but I guess it's like exposure therapy the more you do it yeah yeah like not that it gets easier but I think you find you find the beauty and the fascination in it and you become more and more drawn to it yeah I totally I know exactly what you mean yeah and it is funny because this is a book that I I couldn't have written like just I mean not just sort of as a writer is a historian but psychologically I couldn't have written this book even five years ago I mean I I think it's it's sort of what what also runs through this book um so you can see your sort of your psychological is brewing out sort of other layers I do know yeah oh yeah this is like exposing the the soft underbelly but yeah but the the other thing that very much so in the time between essentially signing the contract for this book and then delivering it I had two babies in very quick succession and covered how okay so they're one year apart and the second was born very much in the middle of sort the winter of oh gosh lockdown three I think and then that lots of sort of and then it wasn't a good time psychologically and there were lots of and actually I so for me this is sort of a celebration of of of of kind of humanity but from the point of view of it's okay that some of this is dark you know let's sort of as you say let's sort of turn towards the darkness and sort of it actually ended up being written down very very early on in the book and then I realized this is what I want to go out with and it you know it said it said you know it's it's through those little fragments of lives the bits and pieces that fell between the cracks that we're able to reach out through time and space and then you know we listen to the breath breath flashes of their stories like blurred radio signals that cut out and pick up interference from other stations and among the white noise the vanish moments sucked into time alive lived events experienced emotions felt and it's that last line I say and so we bear witness to those who came before us gather them into our own stories give them new meanings and new voices and that for me was quite a difficult passage to write you know it reminds me there's there's a psychiatrist who is quite influential in my work named Irvin Yalam and I say was he's still he's still alive but he's no longer practicing but he's quite close close to the end and he he talks about he writes quite a lot about fear of death and about why we struggle with our own mortality and what kinds of things come up for us when we contemplate mortality and one of the things he speaks about is that he finds as a great comfort is this idea of ripples that even if we are not famous even if we are not some great leader and we don't have books and books and books written about us we impact others in these small ways we send ripples out into the water of existence and they continue to ripple and they continue to impact others and really I feel like you're tapping into this idea that all of these were people and their ripples continue to shape the you know the writing of history the effect I think that's that that is yeah as close to what I was trying to do I think I could never express it so eloquently but that's exactly it's yeah and there are so many different versions of any any you know any historical period that you can tell but for me yeah it was essentially it was about the ripples and it was bearing witness and and it exactly as you say it's not you know it's ironic in a way because there's a there's a the very famous Old Norse poem written down in these sort of the 13th century but sort of we're not sure how old it is and it's called Hauvermau which is sayings of the high one and the high one being Odin the god and so it's sort of a poem of his wisdom and I say wisdom Odin is not a very nice character but you know let's leave that for now but the the most famous verse it basically says uh cattle die, kinsmen die, the self-tumors die and the one thing that remains is sort of essentially the reputation of a good person and it it is that and it's it's sort of sometimes that's interpreted sort of very reasonably as sort of the fame of a good person but I when I read that I for me my interpretation of that is much more about yeah the ripples essentially I feel that's and it's actually I mean the the title of the book also kind of feeds into that because embers of the hands is a kenning so it's a poetic little sort of cryptic crossword clue essentially that in in Old Norse poetry and these little so Old Norse poetry is absolutely fiendish particularly the type that uses kennings I mean it's oh my goodness um called skull dick verse and it's written down by sort of these often quite famous skulls who you know would would be working at royal courts and all the rest of it and so it's it's very intricate very beautiful but very sort of gnarly poetry and so you might get or I'm trying to think the there's some really great kennings but it's essentially poetic ways of describing a very ordinary thing and embers of the hands means gold or treasure and it's you know you imagine sort of glowing something glowing in your hand and and something that's quite dangerous to hold on yeah like it's hot and if you're not careful little burner hole in your head exactly there's a potency to yeah and initially it's part of a poem that's written about King Harold Hodrada you know who we've already mentioned killed at the Battle of Stanford Bridge in England in 1066 because Harold had sort of a very very kind of like you know when we think of those stereotypical Vikings that you know we opened with Harold is basically that in many ways you know he's a kind of daring do you adventurer who goes off to Constantinople now Istanbul and he sort of becomes one of the the members of the bodyguards of the emperor of Byzantium and he all sorts of adventures comes back eventually becomes King of Norway and and this poem is written about something he does in Constantinople and he's there it's not a very nice thing that he does he sort of blinds someone on the orders of the emperor but it's he gains embers of the hands he gains treasure he gains gold as a result of what he's done and that's all good but again I thought yeah those aren't my embers of the hands because the embers of the hands I'm talking about are sort of forget yeah forget the headlined hint is forget sort of the kings and you know the this sort of saga heroes and the people who would end up in sort of the historical chronicles and chronicles and annals you know the embers of the hands for me are those little glowing remnants of lives lived and very much ordinary everyday lives lived because I mean it's sort of you know if if you have a I don't know they would say you know if if something if you've got to get out your house really quickly and you know you're not going to be able to come back what are you going to take well it's very rare people are going to take you know I'm so topical at the moment yeah yeah it's like I'm thinking I'm thinking about my go bag that I packed this week here in LA and it was I've had this conversation with patients and with colleagues and and what's so funny is you've I also think you have different kinds of people and I would I don't know this I'm about to get deep here but one of my favorite poems is this ee coming ee coming sperm since feeling as first to pays any attention to the syntax of things will never holy kiss you and because it's a reminder for me to sort of get out of my cognitive self and get into my feeling self and I packed my go bag and there was not a single sentimental thing in it it was my passport my mortgage document that's so interesting some yes and I was like okay wow my pictures would have burned my yeah I don't have that many sentimental things yeah but I didn't really even think in that moment that is so interesting and the thing is you know I'm I'm sort of a lucky not to not to have had to pack such a bag at this point but and it's really interesting it's because because the things that spring to mind that I would pack I mean I mean to be honest I'm so I'm like I'm so impractical I probably would pack this bag and then be completely screwed you know if you like I guess you have like it you don't have a ticket rush oh my goodness I was yeah my bag would basically be the equivalent of what my children would pack it'd be sort of the country toy I've had from birth and like my favorite bird but see that's so lovely because all those other things that I'm packing for practicality can be replaced but the things that you're packing will never be replaced you know if they burn in the fire yeah they're gone but you know I get halfway down the street realize I can't go back and I'm like oh shit right no got a toothbrush and look at my passport I've not got my cockies so my life might might be easier postfire but yours yours may be richer I think that's the difference I'm not going to be able to start my car with my childhood teddy bear am I exactly yeah but it is that isn't it is it is interesting it's it's yeah I think I think writing this but really made me think about that it was like what what do you what do you value and the other place that happens of course is graves and that's like a huge source of because in the Viking Age as in many other cultures before they sort of convert to Christianity which is around the year 1000 give or take if they're often buried with grave goods and again it's so it's not what's in your grab bag when you're trying to make sure you get out of the house safely but it's sort of a version of that because it's what are you going to take to the next world with you the UK cover is different to the US cover and on the UK cover yeah on the US cover there's a cold yes and a thoughts hammer the thing is it looks like yeah yeah I mean literally that it's hilarious that thought you see there's runes those little spiky letters on top they literally read if you translate this is a hammer oh thanks it's like a it's like a it's like a hand yeah it's like a little yeah so it's sort of about it's actually about belief so it's about the symbol of the pagan god's thore he's like the thunder you know so it's that and the the comb on the other side is the earliest example of you see it's got runes on it as well it's the earliest example of runes that we can read they date I mean way back you know you think we were placing the Viking age these runes on that comb they were found in a Danish bog they were deposited there with a load of other war gear so this is clearly very turbulent time there's lots of Roman Empire stuff there even though Denmark was never part of the Roman Empire but we're talking around the year 160 so yeah so if we're taking if we're trying to work out the origins of the Viking age well you know you can take it back into into sort of the Roman Empire essentially but what's interesting is that well actually yeah neither of these examples to my knowledge trying to think about the the thores hammer because plenty of them are found but I can't remember the context in which this one was found but plenty a lot of the artifacts in the book were ones that were found in graves and there's something so on that there's one and it's on the UK version and it's certainly inside as a as an image on the US version and there's a little sort of piece of metal and it looks and on it there's sort of a embossed I think is there so it's either a lion or it's a wolf or something and it's kind of pouncing and that was found it it's a really interesting one actually because again if we're talking about that what is the Viking story um you know even with those raids which are very sort of masculine there are women in those stories as well because that specific artifact was found in the grave of a woman and a child but the artifact itself was taken it looks like from a Christian maybe a maybe a sort of the cover of a gospel book which were very sort of they were very ornate very highly decorated so it was probably taken on a raid and it was given to a woman not necessarily the woman that was buried with it it looks like it's been passed down the generations and it was turned into a brooch and so you know in terms of those embers of the hands even something that is quite shiny and you know quite bling in a way actually they take on new meanings and new contexts depending on sort of what happens to their lives you know the sort of the lives of these objects as they sort of travel down the centuries and the lives of the people who come to own them so it's it's always it's so much you know there's there's there's a kind of a warping a weft to to this sort of history that that can pick up so many different threads and that's I think when you do have that moment and I know that you almost cautioned us because the past is like another universe but you know when we when we look at this I guess more like from a biologic evolutionary genetic perspective even though it was a long time ago and maybe people were slightly more diminutive or maybe people were slightly more whatever their people were in the exact same species you know and and as in so far as language shapes us and experience shapes us fine but the capacity is there like it's the difference between life span and life expectancy like the life span has never changed for people the life expectancy has changed based on external factors but genetically you know there's nothing in us that said we had to die young back in the day we just got diseases and didn't have medicine so when I think about you know a person on a Viking ship that's that could be me if I were dropped into you know I didn't choose when to be thrown into existence they wouldn't they're not they're not different from a from a people perspective and that's the amazing thing they're shaped differently there's just bits that really sort of get you sort of in in the where where and and it is and it's like okay I I'm not saying I completely understand the nature of of what this life would have been like like but I I kind of I see you as another human who just lived so one of those in fact sort of if you've got the books is that there's a I think that the picture so the end of chapter three so there's and I think it's in the plates as well but again because so my my US version I have they're all like being cozy inside rather than freezing cold in the potting shed right now but so if you see right at the end of chapter three so there's these little sketches and these little sketches that were drawn by a child in my class too you see and what I love is the one on the left and of course we can't know exactly what they were it's the two figures both dressed as warriors you know they've both got these really cute garden rake style and but one of them is clearly a child one of them is a grown-up and for me it's like that this has got to be his dad or his uncle or his brother or some oh yeah do you know and he's like I'm a little mini me warrior and then the the the one that's in the plates is so sort of I don't know if you've got the plates in the middle with all yeah and he's just and I think it's number six and it's one of these little they're drawn on Birchbach and it's this little person again and he's called on them and he's I love this because this for me yeah feels like that moment of reaching out you can see on them and he's got his little eyebrow and he's reaching out his little garden rake hand to another bigger thing figure who's sort of been cut off the edge we don't have that and for me that image that feels like the the whole book that that mo and I it's interesting because there's a space between those two hands they're not holding you know there is that space that's that there's that gray area but yet they're reaching out exactly and you know that yearning all right yeah and you see something like a face yeah and it's it's amazing too that even just the way that they're drawn is the way any child would draw a person exactly you know there's nothing there's nothing you know quote foreign about it there's not it's it's it's that common humanity it's oh it's got a face yeah and it's got these like very stick like arms and legs with the little fingers oh it's just so sweet isn't it yeah and and there's so many of those and sometimes you just get so my my parents have this tiny little um like it's it's it's sort of a piece of fabric is piece of embroidery that's in a in a frame and the frames will crack I think my mum picked it up in a charity shop and it just says it's embroidered and it says remember me and then underneath it has a date and it's 1851 and for me I've always again that's something that sometimes is quite hard to look at because it's so poignant yeah it makes me yeah I'm like it's very much even thinking about like yeah I'm creating it in my mind obviously because I've never seen it but what a beautiful I mean because of course I I work with individuals who are approaching end of life and we have conversations like who do I give at what to and what matters to me in the end and where what do I want people to remember about me what is my legacy and we we even in my clinic we have once a month or once every few months actually a meeting with all of the different providers and clinicians and and we go through and we read the names of everyone we've lost during that period and people will speak up and they'll say these lovely things like I worked with you know so and so for this many years and I remember she always wore this one you know woolen hat and one time I commented on it and she told me how she knitted it before her first chemo and you know and there's always these stories that are told and it's like an iconography of people yes that's these things stick out for us and we yeah we remember that it that's it and I mean I know even sort of within kind of our little family unit there's um you know one of their uncles birthdays and every year we celebrate even though he's he's no longer here but it's with daffodils because that was when when it was his birthday there were staff radils or you know there are people who quite a few family members who are essentially sort of knitted into the stories of the family even when sort of so in the case of my children they've never actually met these people they died before but they are still you know and they'll say things like I don't know I love granny grie and for me this might that's my Dutch grandma who sort of was unbelievably influential and and I I know that you know it's part of their story it's part of their narrative even though you know it's part of their their family memory their cultural memory their sense of who they are and that that's something that you know in a way yeah it just felt like a slightly longer you know chronologically speaking like like a version of that it's like you are part is what I say in that last paragraph you know we knit them into our stories we create new you know it's it's it's it's it's you you are you're seen and you remembered and and whether they knew it or not you know like they may not have ever thought about the fact that putting this thing in the grave with you know this this could have been for some very personal reason or or maybe there were times where it was like I will carve this into a wall for future people to me and you know but either way those things those little fleeting nuggets those embers of the hands yeah they persist and they they help us piece together maybe not a perfect story and maybe a story that we take liberties with but an animation of the past because that I think is is that is the fundamental truth is that these were people and we are of the same lineage we are these people as well exactly exactly that yeah yeah oh Eleanor this was such a fascinating talk there was there's obviously there's a million things in the book we didn't even touch on but I I never feel too guilty about that because I I also feel like sometimes when you listen to a podcast episode and they're like let me tell you everything okay it's like I read the book I don't need to buy it like no no no still read the book there's a lot there but but I like to kind of wet my appetite for a book but we have these these themes a little bit more and also first thing in the morning right you're in the UK I'm here in the US so we're recording this first thing my morning yes yeah do you on the recording that that was the first time I'd use my voice see where is I'm done you know this is I'm sort of what it's just gone six my time so I'm looking up for the weekends perfection but yes this this kind of shared humanity whether it's across distance or across time I think is something that is so deeply meaningful and that we don't always I mean you do I think to some extent I do but but we as a people don't always take the time to really revel in and sit with the reality of how how much awe there is in the fact that we can connect across oceans and also across millennia like that's incredible yeah I know I completely agree and I I really love it that you know the beginning you said ah you know I'm just not I'm just not by the Vikings but honestly I feel I'm trying to think of a sort of not cliched way of saying this I can't really think it's this because it's past six right my side but but like I feel I feel so I feel so seen I feel like you see what I was trying to do so thank you so much it's it's like seriously it's so uplifting you know it's like yeah oh I love you and thank you for speaking to somebody like me you know what I mean like like I think pleasure you feel seen because there is something to see there like they're they're definitely is there's a world that we live in and you know I talk about this a lot on the show and whatever we won't get into the last few minutes but we live in a very intensely patriarchal you know male white supremacist world and and it's it's the water we swim in so we don't always see it it's so normative and it's so in the background for most people that we think it's essentialist and it's the way it is but the truth of the matter is as as women very often were confronted with our second class nature and I think to hear these these grapplings from somebody who who gets it you know it's like that's why that's why I see you because you see me yes and so yeah I mean see we could we couldn't we couldn't spend a whole hour just two second five times oh my goodness there's a whole bit the one of my favorite bits not to sort of go off and attend you know what it was not but there is there is one of my favorite bits of the whole book is basically when I'm describing women's textile production which sounds like it should be like let's not kid ourselves a little bit tedious but what I try and say is look without these women there wouldn't be any Viking age because there'd be no sales to get across you know if they're making textiles there'd be no clothes you just end up with some naked men in a rowing boat and then because they're the ones that are also sort of giving birth a lot of the time or bringing up the children whatever it is well before long you've just got a boat because there's no one left so yeah this I mean one guy in a boat with a bunch of goals nothing to do I think you enjoy that mate yeah yeah yes there are many many layers that you're right we could go for another hour on that but but I will not keep you but I am just so very very grateful for the hour that you spent with us today for the book everybody it is called Embers of the Hands Hidden Histories of the Viking Age by Dr. Eleanor Beraclough Eleanor thank you so much for being here thank you honestly it's complete pleasure thank you and everybody listening thank you for coming back a week after week I'm really looking forward to the next time we all get together to talk
