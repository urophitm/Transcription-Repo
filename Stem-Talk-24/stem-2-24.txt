 Welcome to Stem Talk. Stem Talk. Welcome to Stem Talk, where we introduce you to fascinating people who passionately inhabit the scientific and technical frontiers of our society. Hello, I'm your co-host Marcus Baume and a Senior Research Scientist at IHMC. Joining me to introduce today's podcast is the man behind the curtain, Dr. Ken Ford, IHMC's director and chairman of the Double Secret Selection Committee that selects all the guests who appear on Stem Talk. Hello, Marcus. Good to be here. Dr. Mark Hamilton is a professor of health and human performance at the University of Houston and is an expert in muscle physiology. His laboratory has conducted basic and applied research in both animal models and humans to identify and test strategies for disease prevention across the lifespan. Mark and his lab have long worked to understand the impact of a sedentary lifestyle in general and of sitting in particular. Our listeners have shown great interest in a paper he published in the journal I Science, which introduces the soleus push-up. We will discuss this important research in some detail, but first we have some housekeeping to take care of. We are grateful to all of you who have subscribed to Stem Talk and we are especially appreciative of all the wonderful five-star reviews.

Hi everyone, this is Marcus Bauman, Senior Research Scientist and Director of Health Span Resilience and Performance at iHMC. Sitting in as a co-host today with Dr. Ken Ford, excited to interview and talk about the latest research with Dr. Mark Hamilton at University of Houston today. Well Marcus, this will be an interesting interview and let's get right to it. Sounds great. So Mark, welcome to the podcast. Well thank you for having me, I'm glad to speak to you. So today, Mark, you're considered an expert in muscle physiology, focused on solving some of the most difficult problems of metabolism and biochemistry. But our listeners would like to know a little bit more about your early life, so tell us a little bit about where you grew up, which I understand is about 90 minutes outside of Houston. How would you describe your childhood? It was a utopia for a young boy in Texas at the time. I thoroughly enjoyed my childhood. It is a rural county, a lot of farming still is. Fortunately, it hasn't changed that much since this many years ago. But I had a lot of opportunity for doing things with a little bit more independence than even kids back in the day. And as a result of that, I think it helped me as a scientist because oftentimes as a as a science, you're trying to do things hopefully, depends on the kind of science you do, but you're trying to do things hopefully that sometimes are uncharted and there's not a blueprint for. So it was a good childhood for that. It sounds like it would you say that you're a affinity for the real world kinds of problems that you work on began in some way with your involvement in your childhood with hunting and studying animal behavior and learning in very hands-on way about anatomy and the physiology of animals. Yeah, I definitely would think so because there's that curiosity that I think that is certainly not unique to our times, but it's always been a human characteristic that we we see things and we want to figure it out. And I think that one of the interesting things about looking at animals specifically and in comparative physiology and fields like that is that we can learn an awful lot about some very fundamental principles by looking closely at some of the special characteristics that different animals possess. And we oftentimes forget that in human research, while there's a need to try to generalize and describe things in a way that that is helpful for sort of the immediate clinical setting, we oftentimes might lose sight of some powerful breakthroughs that are out there that are sitting under our nose all along and we just don't pay attention to it. Hopefully we have time to discuss that a little bit more this as we talk today because certainly in my own research it's it's a good illustration of something that has been right in front of us for many years but nobody had bothered to even see it. You know, it's interesting a real world comparative biology experience is just so enriching for a kid. What else did you do for fun as a child? Did you, you know, have any hobbies or sports? Yeah, I was definitely just a variety of sports at different stages in life and like a lot of young boys, you know, it's your job. Sometimes you take it on with gusto which develops not only discipline but like I described before sometimes independence. If you want to get good at something it doesn't necessarily always take place in a formalized type of setting. You might not for example have competitive sports or coaching in the sports that you might be interested in doing and you just you figured out you find your way to improve as much as you individually can. And I still to this day enjoy that about exercise for example. I'm pushing 60 now and I still trained as hard as I did when I was 15. I enjoy that very much. I think that one thing is probably true with most people who do something related exercise physiology is that that they want to know how their own body works and that might have led them into the field. And it's okay. There's nothing it's nothing selfish about trying to figure out how your body works. I think that's a great way to think. Yeah, I think that's a really important driver for a lot of people in the field. You didn't go to college though with the idea of becoming a scientist. So what did you have in mind when you actually started your undergraduate studies at the University of Texas Austin? Yeah, I was probably like a lot of kids that I had not been mentored or told about different career paths. I was fortunate to be able to go to a school like University of Texas and at the time this was quite a few years ago but it was it was still had that what we've sometimes call in modern academic sort of an old school approach to university where there weren't as many established requirements for certain degree plan and even if you were a science major they encourage you to get a BA instead of a BS and you could you could explore different topics and then that way you're taking things that you're truly interested in at that moment. And so I did that and I frankly didn't ever really envision graduate school certainly a life as a scientist until you know several years into my training. I was probably almost a senior as an undergraduate when I started that he could think about graduate school but the good news for me was that I had been doing all those things that probably would be ideal for preparing. So in other words I had by that stage a masked couple file cabinets of journal articles and I didn't do it for classes I didn't do it because I thought I would have a profession it was just it was very interesting to read journal articles and remember this was this was back when we had Xerox copiers for a nickel a page we didn't have computers to download PDFs and so you would sit in the stacks of the library and read journals much like you read a book and you'd go through and say I'm going to get through an issue today and I'll pick it up and read another issue tomorrow and you see rocks the ones that you like the most. So we've kind of lost that it's unfortunate that with the massive number of journals that are published in high availability I don't think many even even when I talk to my peers or scientists they rarely take much time to sit down and just read through entire article they're looking for something when they read a paper they're looking for something that might help provide a reference for something they're writing or skimming skimming titles and topics and a lot's lost in science when you when you don't actually enjoy the process of learning. Yeah I'd say we're we're of similar age and and I remember those days and value those days as well just in the basement of the library near the cop year with volumes of the journal of applied physiology or the journals was there something in particular in your zoology undergrad training that led you to say hey I want to do a masters in exercise physiology was there a particular study that sparked you. No there really wasn't this is kind of a humorous thing to look back at maybe a little insulting too but I don't mean it to be I didn't even know there was a department of exercise physiology or exercise science on campus and I had not taken a class in it I had was totally unfamiliar that there were there were people actually studying that on campus and you think I would have known that but I'm not you know there's a lot of reasons why you would have and it happened to be that there was a doctoral student of Ed Coils who Andy Coggan and he's had a good career of his own and he was looking for endurance trained cyclist for his own dissertation and he needed people who were willing to commit to giving him a bunch of biopsies and blood samples and I thought that was fantastic and so it really you know once I was in their lab then became pretty clear pretty quick that this was something that I had a big interest in. So Mark please share a little bit about what you like most about grad school particularly as you pursued your PhD at University of South Carolina. Well I had a very fortunate and unusual situation there as well I went there to get a degree in exercise physiology and I did actually I did all of my research for my dissertation in another department working with a professor who who didn't study exercise and he was actually trained as an engineer but but did a lot of work with a model to study fluid balance specifically transcampillary fluid balance and it involved a massive amount of surgery techniques that I got to learn and I enjoyed it because he was extremely good at trying to think through processes that required oftentimes modeling and when you're trying to study how stuff gets in and out of capillaries it's pretty fundamental to any tissue no tissue can live without it well sometimes talk about hormones and substrate delivery and whatnot but that we we lose side of the fact that you just can't deliver something in the blood to a tissue and then hops out it's there's actually a capillary wall there that has to get through and vice versa things have to get back out and you you can't see these things microscopically you have to infer what's there but we we had techniques that were able to provide very definitive types of transcampillary flux of molecules so it was great for me it was like I said a lot of hands-on surgery learning how to think about processes that others were not studying or could not study and unfortunately that whole field is now shriveled up there's nobody left alive on earth that that actually been understands those concepts back in the 20s through the 50s and sit even into the 60s there were people winning Nobel prizes in this it was a hot area of science but for a variety of reasons not due to lack of importance but just lack of not fitting sort of the molecular biology world not fitting you know cure a disease tomorrow quickly with a new pharmaceutical or new nutritional trick that type of fundamental research is not done hmm that's a shame in my view oh it's it's an amazing shame I mean like I said a second ago just imagine that every single thing that you eat or drink or every molecule has to get into a cell of any time has to get from the capillary into the interstitial space and then everything that is secreted by a tissue has to get out of that interstitial and people just treat us as big black box you know we just ignore it but what we learned in the lab I was working I'll give you a quick example of how fundamental this is how crazy important it is is that even you know if you if you look at a medical textbook what they will teach you is that things that are small molecules the size of a salt something like sodium and chloride very small molecules are they would say freely diffuse between the bloodstream and the interstitial and that the barriers the plasma membrane of cells the cell wall or so and even water does not freely move through the capillary wall so we were doing things like for example we had doing cats which you can no longer use in medical research you can go to a pound and get a cat that's going to be euthanized that afternoon we would go to them and get them and and and we were able to use cats because they had a big enough muscle mass to do these studies and you had to literally close off every single blood vessel coming into or out of the leg much different than the rat highly profusion technique and so we had pure muscle and then you could put muscle on a scale just a balance way it you know very accurate very simple technique and then we could perfuse anything we wanted to through that limb and we would oftentimes use the animal's own blood but then we would enrich it with salts or change osmolally something like this so the point to this is that we had control over what we were doing and what was amazing was that even salt sodium chloride something as small as that we would see is is restricted from defusing through the capillary wall into the interstitium and the the absolute proof of that I mean it's very definitive is that if you have a change in the salt concentration you could do this with glucose by the way as well any any molecules what you would see that there's an osmotic transient across that capillary wall meaning that water comes out of the interstitium and into the bloodstream immediately and we know that because we were weighing the tissue and the tissue weight would rise when you lower the osmolality in the blood or vice versa so you'd pull water out of the tissue when you added salt and the point to that is there's no way water could move unless there was a semi-permural membrane which had to be the capillary wall and so we looked at water movement and and literally we could trace any molecule you wanted to we use all kinds of molecules but the point to that is that nothing is freely permeable not even water across the capillary and so oftentimes when we talk about hormonal changes we're measuring something to blood we're not measuring supplement in the tissue and we would measure the time constant for that it was depending on the size of the molecule even small molecules like salts would take not seconds but take you know an hour or so to equilibrate so it's very fundamental and it would apply to any drug that you deliver it would apply to anything and like I say that the folks who are studying this in the 1960s were genius I mean it was amazing what they could figure out and it was you know applying laws of physics and very straightforward mathematical equations and mass balance calculations and and it was a great training for me even though I didn't get to continue on in doing that work largely for reasons of funding like I described before but that it taught me how to think differently you know everybody likes to think they're a critical thinker and tell you really work with somebody who challenges you in ways if you have to develop so I really appreciate it that yes I understand that we both had the good fortune or some people would not like it but I think we both had a very independent experience in doing the PhD a high degree of independence is that correct that's very correct yeah I'm and my department that exercise science department was very awesome about allowing that you know I worked in the in the medical school and spent all of my time there I got to take my most of my classes there but I still got to benefit from the collegiality and taking some classes and exercise science and so on and of course I wanted to to one day figure out how I could apply what I was learning to the questions that were related to exercise and and I think that even as a master student when I was at UT Austin I had the same opportunity to to have that kind of independence and I was very curious about how dehydration affected the body and where the water came from it why did it come from different parts of the body and not other parts and so I thought that you know there would be a ways of applying and understanding of osmalality and tissue fluid balance and solute movement to that question and maybe who knows maybe someday I'll have one of those a half-time retirement type jobs where you get to pursue those things that young people don't get to do yep I have some colleagues exactly in that situation and they're having a great time you return to the university of Texas in Houston for your postdoctoral research this time at the School of Medicine focusing on physiology cell biology and pharmacology what was that time like well that was a good time too this was now we're in the 1990s and the early 1990s was sort of the early years of when molecular biology was starting to be applied to questions like control of metabolism and life or proteins and and even exercise and there weren't many people in the exercise field who who had developed a laboratory that was funded to use molecular biology and Frank Booth was in Houston and so he offered me a position he had a grant that had been active for about a year or more but he he didn't have a current postdoc working on that particular project and so he it was a great setup where he said you know come for a year I know that that I'm probably not studying and I was he was studying how muscles atrophy with aging and the role of insulin-like growth factors and so on and he knew that that really wasn't what I had a specific topic but he said you'll learn an awful lot about this emerging field that could suit you well in the future and I thought it was very generous up and turned out I ended up staying there much longer I ended up getting funding of my own which allowed me to get a lab and so I ended up staying there six years and so it was like I said an exciting time back then it was and I don't know if you follow this area work but everybody was under the suspicion or assumption that you could identify a regulatory region of the gene can say this region was responsible for either turning on or turning off that gene transcription or sometimes post-transcriptional regulation to specific processes and it was maybe a little bit simplistic turned out that there were a lot of regulatory regions of genes and there's a lot of interactions but it was nonetheless a very productive approach because it had helped a lot of us start to see these things much more clearly that work that I started then is still continuing to this day so it's been a good long pathway so speak sounds like it you've made the point in the past that in an age where scientific information is more available to more people than ever before misperceptions are equally abundant perhaps more abundant than ever and you've said this is largely because of remarkably little discussion not just discussion by the public but even among scientists about some of the fundamental facts and principles that should be highlighted and should be guiding the way so considering all of that what are a couple fundamental basics of muscle metabolism you'd like our listeners to keep in mind as we continue our conversation well I think starting with the idea that you oftentimes will hear people say things like because skeletal muscle is such a large tissue that oftentimes the textbooks will say it's you know 45% of body weight something like that depending on how much fat you have and they'll say owing to the to the large mass of muscle it is important for and then they fill in the blank if you were studying fluid balance like I did as a doctoral student you'd say that you say muscles a big reservoir of water and you can drain it instead of having to dehydrate your brain or your liver or something and people study metabolism will very explicitly always argue that muscles important to study because it's a big tissue and so they would argue that it's almost like a sink in that if you could somehow increase enough muscles contractual activity that then it can it can soak up a lot of blood glucose or blood lipids and do other good things for you and so they sort of just look at it it's obvious it's a big tissue and everything I just said is true I don't think anybody could deny anything I just said but but what they're missing out is also totally irrefutable which is that at rest skeletal muscle has a very low metabolic rate and it doesn't matter what animal species you're looking at this is one of the most conserved features about animal physiology is skeletal muscle has a low metabolic rate when it's not working when I teach students I say that that makes sense you know the body is smart and isn't going to necessarily keep the the engine of muscle running when you park it in the garage you want your engine off and and so muscle is it's a contractual machine and when it's not working it it doesn't use much energy and that's a that seems very simple to say is it you know people say it's efficient raster whatever but the implications are quite big and it means that there's a whole lot of misperceptions and we could go through a list of I'll just give you just a couple really quick ones that you probably heard before things like like we all appreciate it's important to have a you don't want to have muscle wasting as we get older or you other reasons that you might lose muscle is so people say we need to bulk up because we need to improve our metabolism less true but until you get start to put the numbers to it and get quantitative about it and what you you start to realize is that muscle at rest is and these are from you know the best methods you can get where you're literally going and put catheters into the arteries and veins of legs so you can measure how much oxygen consumption there is in the limb that that muscle at rest doesn't account for is much of an energy expenditure and utilization of different fuels per pound as even the average body tissue and so when you put the numbers to that for example after eating a meal with carbohydrate in it people oftentimes will say well muscle is the primary insulin dependent tissue for extracting blood glucose and so they would say that it extracts about 80% of the glucose during hyperinsolvent conditions the problem is that those numbers are neglecting a very fundamental fact which is that that resting muscle is is unable to utilize whatever it extracts for a fuel at rest because the metabolic rate is so low and so when when those studies do those arterial venous catheterization type techniques that are very direct they'll say that they can estimate the muscle only accounts for about 15% of the total body carbohydrate oxidation in the post-prangial period meaning that muscle is not burning much glucose so that's a fundamental problem it means that muscle needs to be working to take advantage of the mitochondria that are in muscle and yet you'll see a lot of labs tripping over themselves to quantify mitochondria changes and trying to relate it to metabolism but if those mitochondria are are silent then you can't take advantage of them and again that's sort of a long-winded way of just saying that we have to sometimes look at the numbers and then just use a little logic to piece together a whole host of implications of things that sounds like good advice yeah just as a brief aside mark i have to say opportunity to train with frank booth must have been pretty remarkable i mean one of the godfathers of the field and you know trained himself by sort of one of the godfathers john halosi and just most have been a fabulous time frank just turned 80 as you well know and i don't think he'll ever stop he's still developing seminal discoveries and and just a fabulous person let's go to talk a little bit about your 2004 paper exercise physiology versus inactivity physiology the paper focused on the enzyme lipoprotein lipase and how periods of physical inactivity impact its regulation what drew your interest here and what did you find yeah well that was actually a short invited review article it was in a journal that has a desire to publish concise arguments and so that what they said was you've been giving talks about your research studies for the last several years and in those talks oftentimes you'll conclude with sort of the big picture of where might this be changing a concept that's broader than just the molecular regulation of this single gene or enzyme and what we were seeing was that i described before that i received funny from the NIH through an r1 as a postdoc to study what is regulating the expression of this very important enzyme called lipoprotein lipase and a simple way of thinking about it is that it's sort of the vacuum cleaner for the athyrogenic fat that's in your blood it's the only enzyme that will clear plasma triglyceride or fat from the blood into muscle and out of post tissue it works by itself and so it's obviously the right limiting enzyme diswell for this process and it's very simple in that it lives inside the capillary of tissues but it's not made there it's made in the underlying perankamo cells meaning a muscle fiber a dipacite and then it has to be secreted in sort of swim upstream through the interstitial somehow bind to the inside of the capillary what we call the lumen where the blood is small and I had a naively hypothesized that if you exercise muscle hard through for example run training that maybe you would turn on the the transcription or some other process that caused the muscle to make more of this enzyme and that would help explain why exercise training is healthy for cardiovascular processes and helps distribute fat in a more optimal way but the the the truth of it was that I I completely failed at being able to demonstrate that exercise was was a potent way of increasing the amount of lipoprotein lipase activity and I failed in a it a maybe you call it robust way meaning that when you know you're if you if you fail once you just keep trying it we try all kinds of of ways of training rats on treadmills where I would run them intensely for different durations and different intensities and the conclusion was that you could you could sort of nudge it but you you couldn't have an impressive increase in this important enzyme it one thing that we did know though and it was just an observation that wasn't part of the actual grant that I was working on but we did know that there was a big fiber type difference meaning that some muscles that were red the slow oxidative muscles had much more lipoprotein lipase I mean a thousand percent more than other muscles and it's one of those kind of things you ignore sometimes because you say well yeah but that's a highly like like solius muscle was the muscle that was so rich would say yeah that's a highly specialized muscle it's not representative of the rest of the body and so I and others would tend to downplay that kind of finding and we'd measure it we report it but we didn't think a lot about it it goes back to that large muscle mass perspective that you want a muscle that's representative of the whole body and in human research people would say that that you know you buy off see a big hefty muscle like the vastest lateralis which is the biggest thigh muscle and they say because it's representative of the rest of the muscles in the body so again you're kind of looking for this average effect or whatever but you're missing out sometimes on what's special and so it turned out that what I learned was that and it was largely by accident to be honest I had a technician and I had her measure lipoprotein lipase activity after I induced a couple different methods of making the muscle less active than normal but just for a short amount of time I didn't expect there to be a change it was just a few hours of time and again it was it was purely for another reason and she came back with the results and said it's not there you know it's it's almost immeasurable and I said no no this muscle has very high levels you your control is your bad some are wrong you know it's one of those typical examples where the results are bigger than you expect and a lot for a short we ended up confirming that in a whole string of papers and then we extend we said that if something is changing this much to where just a short period of hours of inactivity of muscle can have this big of a local effect then what else might be changing and it led us to do studies with microarrays where we could take a less focused approach or more unbiased approach you might say and looking across the the genome and we saw lots happening there and we extended that in a variety of other ways since but the point is is that we saw fantastically large effects on this enzyme when we made the muscle inactive for short amount time but we couldn't raise it we can never increase the myelotel muscle and remember this this review was published in 2004 but it means that the work was done years earlier and in what it was pointing this towards was that the some people call the background activity which is your muscle contractions throughout the whole day turns out to not be incidental it turns out not to be just background which exercise training will improve something on top of it turned out to be where all the action was where all the the really cool potent cellular regulatory processes are taking place for this process and so you know we ended up writing a very short article on that to explain our work and we just you know had to conclude in there that sometimes bodily processes are very sensitive to periods of muscular inactivity throughout the day and importantly those processes are distinct they're qualitatively different than the process is by which an hour of exercise training or whether it's weight training or a aerobic endurance training might enhance how in other words the the exercise that's recommended in the evidence-based guidelines is sometimes missing the most powerful things that are happening inside your body and when I teach students I sometimes will say things like you know that the body doesn't know whether you're you're obeying a guideline or not a recommendation by blue rim and panel experts all it knows is what it sees in its in its environment and it it it knows muscle knows whether it's contracting or not for example and and it will sense that and it will respond in certain according ways and so that work was never intended to impact how epidemiologists do their work but it did it eventually did and it didn't intend to to change how the public thinks about what does it mean to be centering but it seems to be doing that too you published a whole string of papers in 2004 the one we're discussing that in 2007 and 2008 kind of elaborating on this theme with two little exercise and too much sitting as the name of one of the papers and that that paper had a powerful conclusion very compelling it the conclusion was it is time to consider excessive sitting a series health hazard and as I mentioned that was in 2008 it's not clear that as a culture we've really made much progress on this and I wondered what you think about that and if you could just elaborate on that and also consider you know when you when you go to a workplace now including where I am right now at iHMC it's full of standing desks and all kinds of things you know balance platforms and both who balls and I want to get your opinion on the efficacy of these things okay well I have to be careful I don't want to discourage people from from having an enthusiastic approach to paying attention to what they do throughout the day but I'll give you a very short answer first and maybe don't follow a follow-up discussion but that I would say that those types of approaches were unintended consequences of what we were saying at least what I was thinking maybe I didn't say it well but that what we were trying to say was that a lot of times in in in science not a lot of times sometimes in science we identify a problem and that's big enough that's good enough for that day right we just need to identify now what we do about it will take additional research but oftentimes people get creative or get a little smart for themselves and that they say aha so a sitting with a with a low metabolic rate in muscle is bad then standing must be good you know and we're like now we didn't say that and I could see where people kind of think that but that that hadn't been studied and we didn't know what was going on there and there's a lot of issues wrapped up in it but we would try to say things like like well if you know those of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s where you couldn't go out in public without coming home without smelling like smoke from tobacco right cigarettes and our clothes were reeking with a smell we didn't think the second hand smoke was bad we didn't pay much attention to chewing tobacco and most of us who grew up in a smoking culture didn't think that it was even rebellious to protect and so we did all those kinds of things but it wasn't because of necessarily a lack of evidence there was some evidence then but that it was more one of these attitudes of well everybody does it and if everybody does it you know then surely can't be that bad for us you know and that kind of thing and that was sort of the attitude that that we not just by the public we saw but but even even by for example in H panels that you think would be a little more open minded and forward thinking to learning new things they say things like we were going to fund your study we really like the basic sides of what you're doing but the significant section of this grant really bothers me because you said it might have some implication to sitting in people and I said but but sitting is was when predominantly people are awake we're in active we're sitting it's just nothing special about sitting it you could be you know just a resting muscle but they didn't like that idea because it was I don't know somehow what seemed too broad of a problem but I think that it's just one of those kind of things that's incontrovertible you'd say every man, woman and child on earth I can guarantee you this is probably the case if we can't generalize things like this all the time so you can make these very bold definitive statements and every animal that we have ever studied when muscles not working it has a very low metabolic rate and that means that process is like that lipopoeting lipase that's this job is for bringing fuel into the muscle there's not a need for up regulating those processes and so there's a lot of implications to that you know cardiovascular responses too I mean blood flow is a very important process to prevent blood clots to improve shear stress and the health of blood vessels and other processes and so we said the implications are kind of big here folks that humans are spending most of their time we actually spend more time per day sitting in active than we sleep so we said what's the most ubiquitous human behavior if you're sitting in active the average person is now sitting about 10 hours a day in active so that's 70 hours a week and I dare say that very few people get to exercise that much and yet muscle will sense and respond to whether it's contracting or not it doesn't matter who you are what you are the metabolic rate will rise in the muscles that are working and there will be other processes that that come along with that all right so you just mentioned mark that it doesn't matter who you are male female old young the impact of sitting is profound and it's going to affect everyone but over the course of all these studies did you see any sex differences worth noting in the research and in other words is there an impact of inactivity for women versus men that that is worth talking about well that's that's yeah that's like tough the answers yeah no for the really fundamental things that I think are most important answers no and our early work was done in rats and we actually looked at that specifically most of our studies were done in female rats female mice they're a little bit easier to to manage and they don't grow big and fat like the males did and we were oftentimes asked by reviewers could go and do another study now in male rats and we done it in male rats to start with they would have never asked probably but so we did that we couldn't see any differences in that and so I think that muscle is less responsive perhaps and say out of post tissue or some other processes but when you when you start to look at the the more what I call the descriptive applied clinical literature that's when you get into these things that are sort of a well it depends kind of answer so for example I have seen some studies where they they've looked at prolonged sitting and again when we say sitting not what I'm trying to your audience where don't mean sitting per se is the problem it's muscular inactivity there is no evidence of a molecular sensor in your buttocks that somehow knows your sitting and then starts doing bad things to you it's much more straightforward than that the muscles aren't working and that's what we're talking about but in the poor descriptive clinical literature when they do this prolonged sitting studies and what they do is maybe feed them a carbohydrate rich meal and see what happens to glucose and insulin responses there are some studies that suggest there might be gender differences and and that's they also differences between ethnicities and those kind of things but that I'm not an expert on that and in the in the study we're going to talk about in a second we we were cognizant of those things and so we you know even though it wasn't designed for this purpose we did break down the results to look at men versus women and we saw absolutely no difference with regards to the role of solace muscle contract to activity even though like I say that some of these studies are looking at other types of treatments or seeing some differences so before we get into some of that more current research just following what Ken had asked about earlier standing desks and so forth I'm curious you know what's your opinion of the current sort of smart watch algorithms for promoting intermittent standing and benchmarks that are built into the watch for movement time and so forth I find these algorithms a little frustrating because the watch knows how old you are it knows if you're male or female and it sort of defines for you what your targets should be when it doesn't know you right well and yeah you are right and you've got that you've got the problem of what do you do about it right and I hate to say this but because it's again we don't want to dampen the enthusiasm of people for trying to do something personally to enhance their health we don't have enough people trying frankly but that you know all the big companies what's some sort of legacy for health care I mean it's it's really interesting that Tim Cook who's the CEO of Apple it said that Apple should be known as a health care company eventually that's going to be their legacy of Elon Musk is doing the same type of Jeff Bezos with Amazon and those are just examples of three of the biggest companies in the world that have nothing to do with health care in the past but they're in a race to create something and so that individuals are are also sort of had this dichotomy where you have a lot of people who might have some serious health problems and we'll do nothing about it and then you have others who are moral standards doing okay but they they are eager to look at something and I'm not critical of either either approach because to be honest people need to be if they have a serious health problem need to be informed more than just with an educational blanket statement but to make it actionable it might be helpful for them to quantify things the problem is what do you quantify you're what are you going to do about it and that's where I would argue that these companies that are spending millions of dollars are as far as I could tell going in all the wrong places because and I've been very blunt about it it's not insulting to say this that they would do a lot better as well as the individuals who are looking for ways of promoting their own health is to learn how to think more physiologically think about how the body works it doesn't mean that you're looking necessarily for the latest protocol you know do this this and this and then you'll get this clinically benefit beneficial result oftentimes that can lead you down the wrong financial and when you start to think physiologically now you can actually apply a little bit more logic to what you're doing that are based on some very sound principles and we'll talk about some of those maybe a little bit later today but that it's these are things that at least would not be debated scientifically there are things that are almost factual and can be highly quantitative and then when you can piece those together you can start to figure out what should these watches be measuring or what should people be doing that are actionable and not just waiting for you know the latest fitness tip of the month yeah I think actionable is a key term there and I know that's the ultimate goal but it's just a it's a curious time that we're in with all of this sort of information overload and what to do with it let's talk about your 2014 paper sedentary behavior is a mediator of type 2 diabetes in this work you talked about utilizing moderate to vigorous physical activity as typically recommended to combat type 2 diabetes but this did not fully encounter the negative physiological toll of too much sitting and I think this sort of led you back to your roots in muscle metabolism and fiber type differences and the acute responses metabolically of relatively fatigue resistant slow twitch your type 1 mile fibers or slow twitch muscles critical to combating the negative impacts of too much sitting so in thinking about this why is the metabolism in a slow twitch oxidative muscle so key here for understanding the healthy response to load or moderate activity yeah so this is where it gets really interesting exciting because I spoke before about the the idea that take a common laboratory model like like a lab rat we know all about its fiber type people have gone in and they've looked at every muscle in it and we knew from that that the soleus muscle was almost completely what we call slow oxidative muscle and despite the fact that in the rat 95% of the rest of the muscle mass is different than that it's this fast glycolytic type muscle and so there's this huge dichotomy going on there and we would look at other animals we heard what's amazing about this this is one of these overlooked things that once you appreciate it it starts to change your perspective is that in every animal that's ever the soleus has ever been studied it's it's unique and it's special that says a lot let me think about this is that you take an animal like a cat you know cats are are known for being sedentary cats are known for being good sprinters they lay around and then they wait for their whatever little prey they're going to jump on to get their next meal and then they lay around some more and so they're very good at sprinting it doesn't matter what kind of cat you talk about but that cats soleus muscles 100% slow to which oxidative muscle 100% and so we knew this not just from you know back in the 1960s when they first started doing muscle physiology on different fiber types with earnest they were looking at fatigue properties and they saw that the soleus can be very fatigue resistant compared to other muscles they did this in cats you know and then they would compare it to another muscle and they looked at metabolism looked at all kinds of things but what's even more impressive than that to me is that the very first really what I would call laboratory-based muscle physiology study ever done has actually series of them was done by a French scientist named Ron Vienn those of you who are medical students have probably heard of Ron Vienn because of the neurovology where he did he was a neuroanatomist eventually and so they called the nodes of Ron Vienn if you know that phrase so Ron Vienn was a genius because then we go this was its civil war era this is the 1860s and 1870s and Ron Vienn figured out how to develop equipment where he could go in and he would look at muscles of different species and we look at that he caught the domesticated cat was one that he included he also included domesticated rabbits versus wild rabbits and you know he's from Europe so he had this European hair that was like a sort of a Texas jack rabbit a very active more of a slow twitch kind of animal he compared him and he did this with these different animals but he didn't just go and look at the muscle he actually did physiology studies where he would stimulate the muscle electrically measure the contractal properties if you can believe this and then he would say that this the soleus for some reason and all these animals is slow in contracting and he you know he said he had right in French and so I have trouble translating exactly but he he used fun expressions he looked at the capillarization which we talked about before remember those are the smallest blood vessels in the body where all oxygen and water and solutes have to be exchanged between the tissue and the blood and he says that the capillaries in the solius are exquisitely curvy with his quote he could see this stuff I mean this was again before we had cars and he looked at fatigue properties and he says that they were fatigue resistant and he scratched his head and he said things like why you know what's going on here and again I give that as a interesting story because it it helps a lot of us say well if in the 1960s these guys were we're doing these great studies on this and in ronvay was doing it 100 years earlier we knew that that this muscle was unique and what we were seeing when we were looking at the effects of local contractual activity or inactivity periods of you know hours of inactivity sometimes chronic inactivity we were seeing that the solius was falling to pot when it wasn't working quickly and we were seeing that it was very responsive to acute contractions throughout the day and but we were also seeing that that traditional kinds of exercise training well sometimes would nudge it sometimes wouldn't change it all it depends on where it started and so we thought that you have to pay attention to this the animal researchers to this day still always would would never think of publishing a paper without having two or three different kinds of muscles to compare the results unfortunately human research is almost never done that way I would you would know the numbers better than I'm artists but I would probably say it has to be well over 90 95% of all human studies it doesn't matter which pharmaceutical study or whether it's exercise study nutrition study it's usually based on a single muscle called the vases lateralis and the assumption as well human muscles of mosaic or fiber types and on the block that's true but again they're missing out that there might be a very unique muscle in the body even in cats even in holly sentery people who could do very little and this muscle might have remarkable properties that can enhance the health of the whole person stem talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition a not-for-profit research organization investigating a broad range of topics aimed at understanding and extending human cognition locomotion health span resilience and performance so that is a perfect way to segue to your 2022 article which appeared in the journal iScience and it's in this article that you introduce the notion of a solius pushup the article is titled a potent physiological method to magnify and sustain solius oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation this is a very interesting article and we've received maybe a dozen questions about the article here at stem talk before we get to the solius pushup however let's discuss the solius muscle itself you've kind of already done that so we don't need a deep dive but it comprises something like 1% of a human's body weight and your work has demonstrated that can sustain sufficient metabolic rate for a long duration and thereby improve glucose and lipid metabolism if properly activated so can you tell us what proper activation of the solius muscle would look like yeah it's actually good that you picked up on that other people who have asked me about this usually skip over that so we say proper activation what we what i really mean by that is that the solius is used for any kind of standing weight bearing activity you do it's essential for that so anytime you you stand in you walk it's the muscle that's most important for your balance and propelling you forward with your ankles bending and so it's it's working harder than other muscles to do that but the body is far in that it's it's developed features sometimes there are anatomical reasons for it and in other cases it's more cellular so that the solius even though it's working hard and producing some power therefore it's very strong muscle it can do it in what we call a energy conserving way so this is really important to understand we to understand the solius pushup development there's a lot that we couldn't stuff into the first paper on this and so we have more more work we did in animals and humans and the bottom line is that the solius when we're standing and walking is working almost entirely in what we'd call an isometric mode which means the same link so in other words if you look at your calf muscle when you're walking and you put your foot down on the ground and then you start to move forward you'll know she ankles bending and you'll say ah the solius is bending but what you're really doing at that point is you're stretching this massive Achilles tendon and that tendon is is massive for a reason all of your body weight is on that one leg where you're walking and it's stretching that tendon and the body's really cool and how it will as it does this it will take the slack out so to speak and allow the solius to work almost without changing its length and you say well why is that important it's important because we and others have shown that when the solius in humans are in animals is contracting isometrically it uses only about a third of the energy that it uses when it shortens contractions and so so oftentimes it's one of the classic phenotypic characteristics of the solius people say it's very efficient and each less ATP and a large part of that is is it's measured under conditions when the muscles is isometric and when you take a muscle out of an animal or a person and attach it to a little clamp on each end and you stimulate to work if the muscle is not shortening during that which is not it is very efficient and that comes down to these little molecular motors that are part of a protein called myosin which is one of the most abundant proteins in the body and that myosin works in the solius and in other slow twitch muscle very efficiently when it's isometric well that's great but but we said was humans our problem isn't how little calories we burn and how little fuel we use our problems if we don't do it enough and so so we were interested in a method that when capitalize upon the good things about the solius perhaps but but actually make it use more energy than when standing and walking and so we developed a straightforward approach it seemed but it took years to actually do and we were able to make the solius active meaning that the motor neurons that are electrically stimulating it are only when the muscle is shortening and under a relatively good range of motion and that led to much more energy expenditure per gram or per kilogram of muscle than we would have otherwise seen and so it's an isolated contracto activity designed to utilize energy by the solius but also it's important to say that you're doing it while sitting which means that the the only resistance that's offered to the contraction is the weight of the leg itself and when you're sitting if you put your feet on a scale the weight of your legs is about 25% of your body weight so it's not 100% of your body weight like if you were standing and walking and that actually turned out to be important for for other reasons that we haven't yet published a stator but it's really cool and that when the solius muscle is shortening against a relatively light low it means that for the same level of effort you get a higher velocity of contraction so remember you think about the power of a muscle is the force times of velocity if you have less force then the muscle can can contract at a higher velocity and again this the reason called a slow twitch muscle is because people say well it's sort of designed to contract under slow contractual states but when you make it contract under a relatively fast contractual while shortening which is the opposite of walking the muscle is actually more energy demanding but also that we didn't predict this it changes some of the other physiological properties that are taking place in terms of the fatigue properties for example the muscle is less fatiguing for a given level of activation when it's got a light load but a high velocity compared to if you have a little bit heavier load slower velocity so there's something about the team that has to do attention on muscle that I don't quite understand but it's a beautiful case where where the muscle can work during the solus push up at an oxygen consumption that are another way of thinking it as a metabolic rate that's much higher than when you're walking or even running and we can probably talk about it in a second but that's some of the data we collected for this paper. Yeah so let's talk about the structure of the study itself. Tell us a little bit about the characteristics of the participants and then also I'm curious. Pretty long term protocol for the solus push up protocol you know 270 minutes it's a long time can you talk about the protocol itself and how many contractions were performed during the the protocol. Sure so we actually had in this particular paper two substudies different participants and different purposes but the 270 minutes is interesting how the media works is that I've gotten more questions about that. I've got just kind of leaving it in there but let me answer this is that what we were trying to do is we wanted prolonged contractual activity. Remember we were interested in testing whether or not ordinary people is defined by this is answering your other question too ordinary people is defined by being relatively inactive except for ordinary activity today living and so you can put them on a treadmill and you could measure VO2 max for example to their maximum cardio-robic capacity and the subjects that we tested were we sound the low end of normal although normal is pretty low and so so these people worked what you call fit but like these cats of Ron V.A. or the domesticated rabbits of Ron V.A. back in the 1800s they do have a soleus muscle that still has phenotypic properties that make it special compared to the rest of the body and so so we said well we want to study you know what's going on inside this muscle and so if we were able to take these you know ordinary people and then challenge them to say well what can the soleus do? How soon will the tea we picked 270 minutes as 4.5 hours because that's a long period of time most people don't exercise even in a whole week and we said we'll make them do it at one you know one shot one day and we didn't actually you know we had a beautiful opportunity here because the people didn't know what the heck we were doing this for it was an unusual exercise they're sitting there talking to you and we've got all this equipment on them measuring different things and that we didn't tell them that our hypothesis was that this would be a fatigue resistant behavior remember this was the first study we did the fact and so they had to collect the data first to know that but that as they sat there they never exhibited any sign of increasing effort if I asked even a very fit person like the two of you to walk on a treadmill for 4.5 hours I'm sure you could do it you guys were pretty fit but I think you progressively start to feel a little bit more tired in certain muscle groups as you did it especially if the the local VO2 in the muscle that was working is above that when you're exhausted doing exhausted running on a treadmill and so what we did is we put these people at an intensity where the muscle VO2 was well above I mean eight times higher than then walking and two times higher than in the last minute of a VO2 max test a VO2 max test is incremental test is stress test where you you make the person run at a higher speed or great on the treadmill each each 30 seconds each minute and then eventually they poop out and that last 30 seconds or minute is the most oxygen consumption that your muscles can help utilize and there's a great stress on the muscle at that point so we had people working at a local VO2 not a whole body to just local down there the sole is higher than if that last minute of a VO2 max test that last a minute and and so these ordinary people were able to do that for 270 minutes eventually you got to stop the study now you know we we've of course since then for for all kinds of cool reasons have said what are the limits of human endurance can you do this for example seven days a week can you do it for months on time you know it's it's a it's a lot of very fun thanks for a person who's interested in performance and endurance and muscle physiology to do and we've done some of those type of things just real quick to wrap that up for someone envisioning what this looks like four and a half hours about how many contractions per minute so the short answer is is it doesn't matter that much how many contractions per minute it's more the range of motion that you're doing it at and it comes down to what we're talking about before but the I'll give you a sort of a range is that when we're walking you you know you might be stepping at at a step-rate of 100 steps a minute and that means it's 50 per leg that's a good starting point for solace pushups it's something that's that you know most people can can voluntarily sit there and activate the muscle at a good high EMG another is a electromography means it's sort of the intensity of how hard the motor neurons are electrically exciting and that'd be a starting point and we've actually learned that you can go too fast and you get up to a rate over say 130 which is still I mean you can move much faster I mean people can sit there and fidget their leg sort of this what I call fluttering it may be 350 times a minute you see people doing this sometimes sort of as a just an involuntary habit but that's actually a efficient motion surprisingly it's we have another conversation about it but that's too fast so so between 50 and 100 maybe 130 contractions per minute throughout that time is a good rate so could you briefly summarize the primary findings of the study you've touched on them a little but in a concise way could you tell us what the primary findings were because they were kind of remarkable okay so remember there are two subsides so the first one was that people could elevate the local muscle v02 the muscle that's recruited at a very high energy demand very high altitude consumption which means that the cardiovascular system was not limiting the amount of oxygen consumption but it also means that local processes were quite special and when it was doing that they could sustain it for hours not minutes so that's from the first seven study now at the same and those same people we also took muscle bobsies and we were very interested in what's going on inside the muscle and the salient finding that are poured in that paper was that muscle glycogen which is normally the predominant fuel for contractual activity glycogen is a form of carbohydrate that's stored in muscle and when it's broken down it forms glucose and then glucose goes through a that about pathway called glycolysis and that then the again product of glycolysis can either produce lact acid or it can go through the mitochondria for what we call oxidative metabolism where you can get more energy per unit of glucose when you do that but glycogen breakdown is by far the normal type of substrate or fuel that muscle would be using muscle can use a lot of different substrates but this is the bulk of it so for example many many studies that have looked to exercise in humans of all different types of cycling walking of the name it have shown that that the soleus included predominantly relies on glycogen when glycogen is at normal levels if you if you got it you'll use it and so even in intensities as low as 25 30 percent of vo2 max glycogen still accounts for about 70 to 90 percent of all of the carbohydrate that the muscle we use and so it's a glycogen centric world out there so to speak when it comes to exercise what we saw surprising to us was that we took Bob's these cerebobs these meaning that we took them at different time points we took one intermediate about 130 minutes of contractions with another two-seventh and we saw that glycogen depletion rates were very slow compared to the energy to man and so it meant that that the muscle had to be used in something other than glycogen as a fuel so in that first paper the glycogen finding was was quite important for propelling us to do the second sub-study because we realized that there's two things about this one is if you're not using glycogen you have to use something else and one of the something else can be fat metabolism and that's contingent upon what you've last eaten or what you have eaten and we showed in that first study also that the type of fat that's in the blood that is extremely a hot topic in the last few years for heart disease is called VLDL it's very low density lipoprotein and we saw that when doing the solace pushups that this VLDL type of fat was decreased significantly and was decreased in a way that exercise has trouble doing the same thing meaning that hard out of exercise or even exercise training has trouble improving this and so we were impressed by the reduction in this fat VLDL but we did that pretty much under conditions where the people weren't challenged with a carbohydrate rich meal so in other words there they were we say a sort of in that transition to fasting so they had more fat metabolism the last key finding though in that first study was that the ability to burn fat for sustained periods of time throughout this contractual activity pretty impressive so these people were able to more than double the whole body fat oxidation just by the small muscle mass activity even in the fastest state and we followed up on that people who are on low carb diets and prolonged fast at least types of things and as many people who are sometimes rightly so interested in what can we do to increase our fat oxidation of the body nutritionally what we've seen is that sitting there and doing the solace pushup is a way to double whatever those numbers are that you can reach and so people who are for example low carb diets you're trying to increase fat burning and so on and we show that this single action the single muscle group is literally doubling those those that fat burning so that was the first study that was the big deal with respect to those findings what surprised you the most was there something that really was not predicted you mentioned one something that you had not hypothesized yeah I certainly didn't expect that glycogen use would be as low as it was given the high energy expenditure of this muscle locally that almost everything in the muscle physiology exercise physiology literature would say that that when a muscle is intensely recruited it will burn down glycogen and then when it doesn't have glycogen it's going to switch over to using other fuels but if you've got it you'll use it so to speak and like I said it's the predominant carbohydrate that's used much more so than blood glucose and a lot of people lose sight of that but that this is a new science here but that blood glucose typically accounts for 10 15 maybe 20% of the total carbohydrate that's used but it's that glycogen use and so and again it's an intensity dependent process meaning that the harder the muscle is working and it makes sense that the muscle is going to need to have that immediate fuel that's residing inside of the muscle cell and it and all it has to do a snip off one little glucose molecule off glycogen there's the glucose there's no need to transport it through the blood through the interstitialment across the plasma membrane it's right there to use and you almost can't avoid using glycogen so the fact that with these kind of contractions it the muscle preferred to use the bloodborne fuels was an important insight like I said it propelled us to the second study to look closer at this at the carbohydrate pitables so mark as you know the myo-fibre type composition and the muscle fiber type of the human soleus is about 80 to 90% type one as we've talked about and these are highly oxidative and relatively fatigue resistant did you detect because you did the do the biopsies did you detect any interesting individual differences between participants based on fiber type distribution even though we know it's primarily type one some people are higher than others yeah no we we didn't meaning that everybody that we've tested even way beyond this subgroup of people that are reported on here we've tested obviously additional people in the follow-up studies and everybody we've tested seems to have a soleus that is innately capable of doing soleus pushups very well independent of age you asked before about sex it's different it's not it's not related that young and old and we've tested in school kids we've tested and as so it's again it takes us back to that concept that Ron VA was speaking about we all ignored for 150 years which was that there's something innately special about the soleus regardless of your habitual activity or inactivity and genetics so when it comes to burning calories and we've talked a lot about the energy burning boost of this one of the underpinnings of sort of the current craze toward higher intensity exercise is the metabolic boost during the long term post exercise recovery I think the higher intensity the exercise the less economical it is this translates into greater energetic demands during recovery and I think a lot of that underlies some of our current crazes with hit training and other things so given this in your current findings have you considered an alternative to the sitting sp use that would demand more intensity and I asked this because the lower the exercise economy is right the more you will boost your metabolism overall we want to be we want to have low economy and burn a lot of energy for the amount of work we put in so have you thought about alternatives well yes certainly this is an important point and maybe this is where you're you're going with this is first of all we're not talking about an either our proposition I understand that if somebody said I have a you know several days a week I can spend up to an hour to get my exercise and I can either go to the weight room and do resistance training or I can do a aerobic training or I can do this or that sp use don't fit into that it's not something that you you do instead of it's not either or that and the reason is is that we're looking for an understanding of how to sustain oxidative metabolism and other effects of contractual activity for hours per day throughout the whole day every day each and every day so it's not competing with they're interfering with what you do in that hour of recreational activity it frankly from a biological standpoint they're not compatible either they're doing different things to your body they're working through different processes I think this is actually this is a really really important point and this is where sort of the media can go awry I think it's important for the listener to understand this is not a substitute this is an entirely different phenomenon which will overall boost your metabolism over 24 hours so it's not an alternative as you said or a substitute for other types of exercise but certainly a supplement to that and I unfortunately as you well know when compelling findings like yours hit the street it can get twisted in turn pretty quickly this often happens as well when somebody underscores you know discovers a new molecule that is somehow linked to an exercise adaptation and suddenly we don't need the sweat we just need the molecule well again it's you have to be logical about this and think like a physiologist is what I would say to students so what do we mean by being logical what do we mean by thinking physiologically what we mean is instead of looking for a protocol of some sort and say do A B and C you know get some kind of potentially clinically meaningful result those types of things are not really what we're going after in at least my own lab there's a place for that kind of work but it's what I would call descriptive research it usually ends up in a long list of caveats where people would end up saying things like well it depends you know you ask questions about gender a second ago or we can talk about this and so what we're looking for are what are more basic fundamental calm facts for the public here just principles that would be solid and and then you take those solid findings and how can it perhaps shape and inform how we live so in this case we would say that it's pretty solid fact that that humans spend a lot of time sitting at a low metabolic rate that's solid we put people in in these special rooms called metabolic chambers where we can measure the oxygen consumption every minute of the day and we can ask them to type and to use computers and and you get the result that you'd expect that energy expenditures low and then you could put devices on people say how much do they sit and they spend more time doing that and sleepy so then we say could now logically take those two things together nobody would probably argue that it's not doing your body a lot of good to be doing that it's not helping you so what can we look for as a solution and and again the soleus push up as far as I know I would say it's the development of the first type of muscular activity specifically geared for improving human metabolism let me think about that for a second I know it sounds a lot audacious but it really is the the first type that that's specifically geared and developed from proving human metabolism most of what we do in exercise physiology is we take things that people already do so for example we already walk a lot right we step a lot some people stand yes and obviously bicycle and other things and then we say that's that we need to do more of it I wouldn't deny that but we they would say now what happens in the body and then you can you can interrogate with all kinds of measurements you could take blood samples you can do like it or biology you could do epidemiological studies whatever you want and you would say we'll doing more of that walking or stepping or bicycling or weightlifting be good for us and why is it good for us that's an important thing to do but what we we came about this from a very different angle and that we were trying to to say there's this need to develop a type of muscular activity that's specifically geared from proving human metabolism throughout the whole day and mark is I know I still haven't answered your question about the high intensity training but but when you I kind of am because if you realize that the high intensity training is fantastic for some processes but you could pretty logically assume that whatever those processes that are turned on within seconds sprinting for example that those signals are going to look very different than the signals that are turned on by a subtle yet sustained increase in oxidative metabolism by us locally in a soleus muscle for hours per day not minutes and so it's a different it's it's touching on a different set of biochemical pathways a difference physiological response in the cardiovascular system and it's hopefully you know meeting some of those needs that have been very difficult including our own lab to come up with solutions for so so it's it's different qualitatively like we said that 2004 article that you you talked about you know it's that there's some very potent processes that are qualitatively different than what happens in that hour that you get to exercise mm-hmm that makes sense we've discussed the soleus push up in some detail but we haven't described for the listener how one actually performs a soleus push up. Could you give us the brief description of how person does the soleus push up properly? So the first point is that at the end of the day what you're hoping to accomplish is a way of sustaining and elevated rate of this oxidative muscle metabolism for as much time as as you desire so that's important because you can do it sitting obviously and when you're sitting you want to sit comfortably so that you can if you're going to be sitting there just like to work right now I mean I'm I'm sitting talking to you guys and I'm not going to waste my time by sitting here inactive when I could simultaneously be doing something that's remarkably good for me and so it does alter a little bit how you sit sometimes you have to maybe think twice about what kind of chair you're in or how you're declining. In a research study we were very careful to keep the rest of the body very relaxed but that when sitting to the other thing is I mentioned before that you want the soleus to be short-mean during the contraction and I mentioned in answering Marcus's question about rate that the rate wasn't the critical determinant of the energetics but rather it was the shortening over relatively good range of motion meaning that if you sat here and you put your foot down on the ground and I said now now I want you to lift your heel what kind of range can you achieve you could probably say well I can get a better range of motion if I pull my foot back so that my toes are kind of under my knee rather than my feet in front of me and so you actually would have a higher energy to man when doing soleus pushups if you pulled your foot back the motion is a is sort of a smooth fluid motion it's one that's much like if you're listening to music and just having a good time in your relax you would be able to contract the muscle without thinking about what you're doing then you're probably doing something right if you're concentrating too much about it and you're trying to tighten things up then you've sort of fallen back into this mentality of it needs to hurt to do me some good that's probably true to a certain degree if I'm doing weightlifting I'm not going to grab a 10 pound bar and push it yeah guy did 10 reps I'm good enough you know you actually want to stress the muscle to see the adaptations you want this is different in that if done right surprisingly there's not fatigue and there's not the succession and unfortunately what we have or we literally now have hundreds of people who have produced videos on how to do the soleus pushup and none of them have any firsthand experience or expertise and you'll they frequently will say things like okay squeeze the muscle so it gets really tight and I think what they're trying to say is this can't be doing me good unless it's hurting me and the the muscle cells don't care whether or not your your brain is saying this is difficult to do it doesn't care what's happening the rest of the body it just says I need a fuel and if I need a fuel I'm going to get it and so it's not necessary so again it's a fluid motion where you're isolating the soleus you don't try to lift the leg either see some people they sort of use their hips or thighs or something they're that's not necessary again you're trying to target it to us to a small muscle group and then the last thing I'll say is that if you practice anything you're going to get better at it and a lot of people get too hung up on trying to optimize something on day one I mean it's much much smarter this is applies to any kind of sport just get out there and do it and if you do enough of it your motor control improves and you become more fluid and smooth and graceful and you learn how to sit if I were to be coaching people on a walking program the first thing is just get out there and you do it a bunch and and you don't have to advise them what kind of shoes to get and other things eventually they're going to get the right kind of shoes and they'll figure out ways to be creative to do more and more of it same thing with soleus push up the goal is to to learn how to do this involuntarily so that you can you can now be sitting there for you know roughly 10 hours a day and reaping the benefits of elevated muscle metabolism for dozens of hours per week and then when you go do your normal exercise you go do it when you want to get up walk around you do it you don't you don't intentionally sit down and spend more time sitting to do this it's only when you ordinarily would be sitting and which is a highly intermittent activity that people do I'm thinking that this could be useful for people who take a lot of long flights like a flight to Europe or something like that you'd have plenty of opportunity to do soleus push ups it might amazing to smay your neighbor on the seat I once right after 9-1-1 made the mistake of hooking up a prototype electrical muscle stimulation device so it had cables and wires everywhere on a flight to Rome just you know to keep muscles active maybe not develop DVTs or something the poor lady next to me really came unglued and pushed the button asking the flight attendant to take a look at my device and see if it was dangerous and the flight attendant was quite envious she said you know they how to give us those things you know we can fly back and forth to Rome constantly but the soleus push up would be somewhat less dramatic and probably quite useful yeah once we reached the stage where we realized that ordinary people with ordinary fitness could sustain this for hours that we realize that okay there's going to need to be a way of ensuring that people don't need to go out and buy a contraption of some sort an exercise machine to carry around with them the difficulty that of course is people like those little machines and you asked before Marcus asked about wearables there's definitely a place for the wearables in this type of thing because you want to quantify what you're doing and it's you gamify it but also to teach people what's the right motion i don't mean to scare people off anybody can learn this physically it's not complicated but i also i'd say that there is a need for at least trying to learn from somebody who has direct knowledge from you know research type setting of how to teach people to do this and it's any good coaching is usually based on experience and we've had a lot of experiencing in how to articulate the right the wrong ways of doing it and not to over complicate certain aspects and just to like i said before if you get better then you can get another lesson you get a little bit better you know if i just invented the bicycle and nobody had ever ridden a bicycle and i was telling people hey i've got this machine where you could ride 20 miles in power and you can go all over the place people say this is fantastic and they would go out and buy a bicycle and they would within about 30 seconds ride into the ditch and then start cussing and say well this isn't working what's wrong with a stupid thing they don't realize there's a little bit of a learning curve to it and it'd be good to pay attention to who you're listening to in this case it's much easier to learn and drive a bicycle but we you know in a research setting we do have the opportunity to do things in a systematic way and some of that is is with technologies but some of it also is just with experience and lots of practice and and so we reached the point now where we didn't expect there to be a public interest in this you know we're we're we're we're accustomed to in the exercise world the public oftentimes being resistant to adopt habitual behaviors that are good for them especially if it's not seasoned and peppered with a little bit of this is going to make you look great you know kind of thing when you look at the solace push up what you're doing with something that seems rather boring your legs are under your desk or in your case if you're flying to Rome it's just sitting down on the floor and it's not bothering anybody choosing not seen by anybody most of the time we're sitting people don't even you're you're low and you're you're doing this much like sitting in a rocking chair or something you just just do it and so there's nothing sexy about that and it's to improve human health it's not glamorous you know if I like doing pull ups and push ups and lifting weights and doing all kinds of endurance training but some of that is I like it because wow look you know look what I can do kind of feeling and it brings some some motivation for that reason with this what's the point you know it's to improve your health and despite all of everything I just said everything I said made me think that the public wasn't going to eat this out it was going to be a good research tool and surprisingly I've never seen anything like this before where from cultures all over the world the number of YouTube videos and the number of tweets and the number of people who are trying on their own you know without any kind of guidelines or American Heart Association or whatever endorsing it people are just single research study basic science study that have decided I want to do this and so you know we've tried to you know in a very feeble way respond to that we you know created a little website and we have created some videos slowly and certainly not not in a spectacular way but more just to help people guide people along and what are the fundamentals that you need to know how to do thanks and it's been a remarkable response like I said from very diverse cultures places in the world that you have a lot of problems going on and you say the last thing they're going to be thinking about is controlling their blood insulin blood glucose are lipoprotein metabolism or inflammation and so on they're going to be thinking about other things that are more pressing and a lot of those countries are jumping on this they say what one it's free and I can do it anywhere anytime and and so it's it is intriguing how it's it's unplayed in the last year I'm sure and it's a nice feeling that you've really captured people's attention and makes a positive influence will include links to your website and the resources that you provide online so Mark this study we just discussed was very interesting and there was a second study that also has generated lots of interest could you tell us about that study how is conducted and what the findings were after doing the first study we saw that the muscle glycogen that carbohydrate stored in muscle wasn't the main fuel that was being used and so we asked the question we said what would that mean for blood glucose regulation it's important to point out something again this is one of these what I call sort of fundamental physiologic facts that's well worth knowing and when you know it it changes your perspective a lot on understanding of insulin and glucose metabolism and it's one of those things that I would say is not debatable which is this is that the amount of glucose that's in the blood or the extruder's space is quite small we have about four grams of plasma glucose five grams of blood glucose so we're talking four calories per gram so we're talking 15 20 calories of fuel that's in the bloodstream due to this blood glucose it's very important to remember that the difference between being diabetic and you glycemic meaning good glucose is about a two-fold difference in your blood glucose concentration so so the difference between a diabetic and a healthy person is less than 20 calories of blood glucose so that's a small number when we talk about 20 calories you can you can burn that down quite quickly with solely's pushups minutes not hours and so burning enough calories wasn't going to be the huge hurdle for us to jump over but that's oftentimes missed and I don't know of any other studies surprisingly my mark is my chime in here but that I've looked for can't find them of what is the rate of carbohydrate oxidation that one needs to have to create a meaningful meaning a large reduction in blood glucose in the post-pranodial period so notice to prevent hyperglycemia and or and or they usually go together reduce blood insulin concentration significantly and I mean significantly I don't mean statistically significant with a good p value I mean a meaningful magnitude of say 50 percent reductions and so you say well how much do you need to actually increase the burning of this blood glucose so energy glucose is a great fuel I don't I don't even know of any other functions that blood glucose has other than to go into tissue and provide you a potential fuel and so it's so the body likes to use it as a fuel so the question is how much do we need to burn and the second study was getting at that and so we we did a very simple mathematical prediction of it and it was in that paper we hypothesized from that that you need to burn about a hundred milligrams per minute of carbohydrate and if you could sustain that it would have a very large benefit on blood glucose and insulin regulation 100 milligrams per minute so we're talking you know less than half a calorie a minute of carbohydrate oxidation to put this in perspective when you do whole body exercise that large muscle mass stuff like you know walking running weightlifting people can easily burn 10 calories a minute entirely from carbohydrate if depending on who they are and so on and when you're doing that you you're burning easily gram amounts of carbohydrate so there's a huge difference between a hundred milligrams per minute and what you get with large muscle so it came down to us saying if you could sustain carbohydrate oxidation by a muscle that isn't burning a lot of glycogen that's point one and two that muscle has all of the molecular machinery for they both the delivery and the extraction and the utilization of blood glucose which the solace has there's special transporters for example they glucose out of the blood the solace is rich in those and there's signaling pathways that regulate this the solace is rich in those so we said it has these intrinsic properties that could maybe you don't need to raise energy expenditure that much and so we want to test that so what we did was we took a group of people and we said we're going to have them do the solace pushup or we call it the SPU the SPU activity again that we did in the first study this time we're going to lower the intensity by one third or two thirds of the level of the first study by lower the intensity we're really pressing the envelope on this hypothesis of how high do you need to get carbohydrate oxidation and secondly by lowering the intensity it means that you're better ensuring that you're not going to use glycogen as a fuel because we didn't buy off the people in the second study and so so then when we did that what we saw was that even this relatively modest intensity the lowest intensity that we studied of this SPU activity lowered the blood glucose profoundly and lower the insulin even more and so we're talking you know 50% reductions in this post-pranial excursion that's a wopper magnitude by any measurement in part because people don't quite realize that we call this glucose tolerance meaning that when you challenge somebody with a 75 gram glucose load and look at the glucose responses glucose tolerance is actually harder to improve than most lay people understand they're meeting very well designed very well-controlled studies that show that even for example weight loss doesn't necessarily improve glucose tolerance even though it might improve measurements of insulin sensitivities measure with sophisticated techniques like the uglicinemic chyper and salineic clamp it doesn't necessarily improve glucose tolerance there's a very good exercise physiology literature that's looked at what happens in the hour or hours after intense exercise and Connie come back to Marcus's question about what happens to metabolism after exercise there is a little bit of an increase in energy expenditure in that first hour after exercise but if somebody is doing this high intensity training for that purpose then there should be very pleased to know that that level is less than 10% of what you get with the solace pusha but what we saw was that all these previous studies that we're looking at glucose tolerance immediately after exercise even hard exercise we're not improving glucose tolerance and that's important in that there's actually mechanisms that explain it and so I think that your listeners for example are probably attuned to something called the glycemic index the idea that the amount of carbohydrate and the type of carbohydrate we eat has a big impact on glucose and insulin regulation what they don't know probably is that in the hour or hours after exercise it's as if the gut in your body is able to absorb glucose faster than if you never exercised so let me say that in a second way is meaning that that the rate of glucose absorption is normally speeded up or set up when we eat simple sugars compared to a complex carbohydrate but that rate of a simple sugar is even sped up as a result of prior exercise the idea teleologically is that it's is the body's way of fueling you saying if you just exercise we're going to make sure you get refueled well so those things tend to work against glucose tolerance and so exercise is really good for us for a lot of reasons but this post exercise recovery metabolism is not well suited for improving glucose tolerance the other thing about this and this kind of also answers Marcus's question in that post exercise period there's not a single study in either animals are in humans that has shown that glucose oxidation is increased so what that means is that while you can raise the energy expenditure a little bit you don't raise the burning of carbohydrate and certainly not specifically blood glucose it actually goes down a little bit and so so those things tend to counteract the ability of healthy exercise to improve glucose tolerance it's hard to improve it so weight loss weight loss is not a good tool unfortunately for improving glucose tolerance I know that sounds crazy to people because they say obesity is a cause of diabetes and so on but there have been very well controlled studies I'd be glad that we referenced it in our discussion where they've done like cereal you know steps where you will lose 5% of your body weight 10% 15% and they come back and they repeat glucose tolerance and it doesn't improve in people even though we measured with a clamp which is a more sophisticated technique for measuring in sensitivity even though the clamp says you improve insulin sensitivity you don't improve glucose tolerance so my point saying all that is that improving glucose tolerance is difficult by nutrition low carb diets tend to actually make it worse not better I'm not saying low carb diets aren't good for fat burning it's just not great for burning blood glucose the solace pushup surprising to us is very adapt at burning blood glucose as a fuel and it burns the sufficient amount over a hundred megs per minute that we you can burn over 200 megs per minute which was an ample amount to improve glucose tolerance then this is a key take on point two is that it does so without stimulating these other counteractive processes that take place after large muscle mass whole body exercise and so it says if the rest of your body doesn't sense there's been this large physiologic disturbance and therefore the it just says yeah the the sole is muscle needs more fuel I'm going to give it to it and then the rest of the body you're fine I'm going to leave you alone you know and we don't see that after after a whole body exercise the other point that we we shared in the discussion was not a study of our own but I think it's one of the most fascinating papers that helps it put all this in context is that they had people do one legatexercise and it was good hard one legatexercise I think it was a couple hours or something and then they put these catheters in the leg and they were able to show that that leg extracts more blood glucose as you would predict surprisingly what they saw though is that the other leg that had been resting took up less blood glucose than if you never exercised meaning if the insulin resistant so whole body exercise is turning on lots of stuff systemically and some of that stuff is counteracting improvement of insulin and glucose regulation and the sole is push-up provides us a way of say let's turn on the good stuff but no more than we need to and let's leave the rest of the the process is alone and we can improve fat metabolism in the hours that blood glucose is not high and we can improve blood glucose and insulin in the hours that that you meet some carbohydrate. Well thank you for such an interesting interview and discussion I think we'll be hearing more about the soleus push-up. Yeah again Mark thank you for the time and this has been quite interesting and I'm sure your research team has new directions that it will go from here. I understand though as we wrap up today that you're headed out for a hunting trip and doing some bow hunting in deer season can you tell us a little bit about that. Yeah so this is you know I'm in Texas and it doesn't get real cold here but we've had a little bit of a cold spell which is a good good news for us so I'm currently sitting in a lot of 55 degree room enjoying myself and so I will are taken and the outdoors as much as I can. Now that's a lot of fun best of success and have a great trip we appreciate your time today. Well I appreciate the opportunity to talk to both. Yes thank you it was wonderful thanks. Stimptop. Stimptop. Stimptop. Stimptop. Well that was a fun and interesting conversation. It was indeed the soleus push-up is quite interesting and for many it could be a game changer if applied properly and regularly.
