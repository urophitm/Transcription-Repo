Hello everybody, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and today we're going to go looking for life elsewhere in the universe I think that with the discovery of many new planets around stars over the last few decades The idea that there might be life elsewhere in the universe has become more and more of a scientific Project of course we've always been looking for it We've been wondering we've been doing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and so forth But now we have a more focused idea of where we might look and a little slightly more optimistic perspective on how many places there are out there where life could be We also talked on this podcast previously about the idea of the origin of life I mean if life only ever existed on earth than search for it elsewhere would not be very helpful But we talked to people like Kate Adamala to Sarah Marie Walker about why life came to exist in the first place Today we're going to roll up our sleeves a little bit and think about looking for life And it's one thing to look for extraterrestrial intelligence very very far away Today we're going to talk about looking for actual living beings here in our solar system People of a certain age namely my age Came of age and at a time when we were looking for life on the surface of Mars with the Viking landers in the 1970s It was very exciting but also a little bit inconclusive We didn't find any life Mars is a pretty dry planet and these days we talk a lot about whether or not Mars might have had life in the past Less so about whether it has life now But don't get the wrong idea because there's other places here in the solar system where life really could exist And we are actually going to go look for it today's guest is Kevin hand who is Deputy Chief Scientist for Solar System exploration at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here in Pasadena, California Kevin is educated in physics and geology and biology and astronomy and planetary science and all of these things Mechanical engineering he brings them together both thinking about what life might be and how it might arise and how we might actually Build something to go look for it his special focus has been on Europa the moon of Jupiter But he also thinks about and Cellulitis and Triton and Titan and other places in the solar system typically moons of giant planets where you can get Oceans underneath giant sheets of ice which might be just the right conditions for life to form Kevin has a new book out called Alien Oceans, which is exactly about this topic looking for life here in the solar system Probably not technologically advanced life don't get too excited But it's very very plausible that microscopic or primitive forms of life could exist elsewhere in our backyard And it's very exciting to think that we're going to go look for them I wanted to mention very briefly that you know we have a patreon here for the mindscape podcast You can find links to it on the podcast web page or just at patreon.com slash shawan m carol But we also do for the for the patreon supporters They get add free versions of the podcast and also a monthly ask me anything episode and now we've let the ask me anything Episodes go public. There's a vote taken by the patreon supporters So only patreon supporters can actually ask questions But everyone can hear the answers so I will put these on YouTube and also the actual patreon post Where my answers with where the episode with my answers is put becomes public a few days for everybody After I posted at the beginning of the month for the patreon supporters So check that out also check out the video series that I am doing called the biggest ideas in the universe We're once a week I tackle a big idea talk about it in hopefully a compelling informal chatty kind of way And then a couple days later I'll do a Q&A video about that So a lot going on here at a time when many of us are locked down looking for things to do We're trying to provide content for everybody so your minds don't atrophy You got to be thinking you got to be moving forward brain wise and this time of quarantine and with that let's go Kevin hand welcome to the landscape podcast Thank you Sean good to see you now I've heard that you just got back from Antarctica and did you find life in Antarctica? Plenty of life not that hard really like you're not really giving yourself a challenge here. That's right. That's why were you there? So our team was testing out and deploying this under ice robotic vehicle that Is something that JPL has invested in as sort of a Win-win robotic capability that can be used to study Earth's ocean and Earth's cryosphere Earth's ice Well simultaneously building some of the capabilities that someday we hope to deploy beneath the ice of a world like Jupiter's moon Europa. Okay, so you're you're there at a place where there was ice on top of water and sending it into the that's right sea ice Around Antarctica. Is this something where the thing you were dealing with had a capability of digging through the ice or did you cheat? No, we're not there yet. So the someday we will have this robot in case then another robot and that other robot will have the job of getting through the ice I'm gonna put the whole thing on a rocket send it to your own Sunday to Europa but Doing so doing what I just described getting through ice even thin ice the ice that we were dealing with in Antarctica down at the Australian Antarctic divisions Casey station. They were great partners That ice is just About 160 centimeters in thickness at least when we were there. That's nothing nothing Except to get through that ice and then deploy our robotic vehicle takes chain saws and ice chippers and all sorts of things and projects that work to get through even thicker ice on earth use hot water drills and and Just thousands upon thousands of kilograms to get through the ice before you can even start to sample what's beneath the ice And so as you can imagine if our dream of dreams is to someday get through the ice of Europa and directly study That ocean and whatever may be alive within it We've got a long way to go And so there's this beautiful win well how thick is the ice we think on Europa? Well, that's that's a huge debate. There are the thin shell is and the thick shell is I happen to be on the thin shell Like you kind of got a plan for a thick shell if you're sitting out the space So to be clear by thin. I mean about let's call it five kilometers and thickness So still pretty much more than a hundred and eighty seven. Yeah, exactly. You're not gonna change all through that. Okay It's By earth standard so the Antarctic ice sheet above Lake Vostok Which is one of these subglacial lakes on the continent of Antarctica the ice above Lake Vostok is about four kilometers in thickness Okay, and that would be considered thin ice on Europa Right, and we can't even really access these subglacial lakes in Antarctica easily So even with all of our human capability of flying down there and people and traitors full of Devices to hot water drill, etc So this is depressing me. This is making me think this less likely than I imagined to easily just dig down into Europa's Welcome to my world. Yeah, okay. It's not for the faint of heart So just I we're just you know the audience here We don't presume they know anything at all So we'll get to what Europa is and why it's interesting But is there a mission planned to go do this or is this just planning for future far off things? Well, so There is a mission that NASA has committed to called the Europa Clipper mission and that mission is a flyby mission It will orbit Jupiter and fly by Europa some 45 or more times and with each flyby some of which may be Fewer than a hundred kilometers above Europa's surface With each flyby it will collect incredible imagery spectroscopy It's got an ice penetrating radar instrument on it to essentially sound into the ice and So it's got all sorts of great ways of looking at Europa's surface looking into Europa's interior figuring out the surface chemistry The surface geology and some of the interior geophysics and that's from from a remote sensing mission a mission flying by That mission does not have any lander on it I'm part of the Clipper mission, but much of what I focus on at JPL is the next step trying to get a Lander down to the surface of Europa or for that matter and sell it as a moon of Saturn that is also Incredibly compelling in the the context of alien oceans beyond earth and and places where we could go to Not just find evidence of life, but find extent life life that is alive today Right not just fossils not just fossils and that's it that's incredibly important in terms of kind of revolutionizing our understanding of biology Do we know for sure that there are oceans beneath the ice on Europa's surface? Well, you of course know that for sure needs to be in quotes, but Based on the available evidence we can make the prediction that the best Hypothesis to explain the available evidence is that Europa does have a salty subsurface liquid water ocean And that evidence I like to kind of partition into three easy pieces, okay? I'm kind of taking a page out of finding six easy pieces, right? And the first easy pieces you spectroscopy to figure out that the surface of Europa is covered in water ice, huh? Rather than methane or rocks or what I think about it 1610 Galileo turns this military tool the telescope to the night sky Looks at the moon looks at Venus looks at Jupiter and sees Jupiter and also sees these four little Points of light which to him at the time he thought were just stars Galileo being a clever fellow Name them the stars of Medici because of course that's where his money was coming from you would name them the stars of NASA So your money's coming from So But but as we know he mapped those little points of light around Jupiter night after night and Discovered that they in fact revolve around Jupiter Which at the time was heretical and got him in trouble with the Spanish Inquisition, but Through his diligent observations we came to appreciate that Jupiter has moons Now those little points of light stayed as points of light for some 350 years until astronomers like Coiper and Vasily Moro Russian astronomer You spectroscopy to Figure out that the surface of Europa was made of water ice. Mm-hmm. So that's the first easy piece Okay, we go from a point of light to Europa having an icy surface. Right The next easy piece I like to make the analogy to babysitting a spacecraft. Okay. What do I mean about that? We've all done So babysitting a spacecraft well Here on earth we use the deep space network this network of antennas Three of which are 70 meter antennas to get the data back from spacecraft into cement send commands up to spacecraft This these the DSN is used for all missions and Along with collecting and transmitting data from the various spacecraft the signals that are received Can be used to look at the tiny red and blue shifts the Doppler shifts associated with those signals sure and Namely this this never ceases to amaze me With the Galileo spacecraft as it was flying by Europa the beautiful little gravity well and you know you're the expert on all of that's and then the fabric of space and time but Europa's got its own little gravity well and and as the spacecraft flies by it causes the Europa's Interior mass distribution and its rotation caused slight accelerations and decelerations which appear as millimeter per second Doppler shifts in the signal being sent back to earth so because so Europa is not a point mass We can't just That's right and not only is it not a point mass but by merit of Looking at the gravity signal of Europa in other words the Doppler shift as the Galileo spacecraft to buy um Scientists on the Galileo mission were able to tease out the moment of inertia of Europa But sorry, we're looking at the Doppler shift of the spacecraft sending its transmission back to okay But it's influenced by Europa and because Europa is not a point mass. It has a shape. That's right a shape Perfect sphere and that's what you can do and not uniform density right Uh, and so the rotation plus the non-uniform density You Puts its fingerprint on the Doppler shift of the spacecraft and has its fly as it fly by and then you can invert those That information about the gravity structure of Europa to get things like the moment of inertia. Yeah From which you can then build layered models. Mm-hmm. Okay. So you say such and such rocks such and such water such and such I say exactly so the second piece of the puzzle is that um the gravity data those Doppler shifts Necessitate that Europa at least in kind of a three-layer model has a dense core iron or iron sulfur a Rocky silicate mantle and then some outer layer of roughly a hundred to possibly 200 kilometers in thickness of low density material Mm-hmm and in particular the density that fits the gravity data well is something in the range of one gram per cubic centimeter Also the density of the glasses of water fun to us right now Yes, and so the the second piece of the puzzle um follows on the first the first says you know that the Europa is covered in ice The second piece of the puzzle tells you that water in some phase be it liquid or solid extends down for 100 to 200 kilometers Now the gravity data Was not of sufficient sensitivity to differentiate between the density of water and the density of ice sure It's a miracle they could do anything at all astronomers are just geniuses at taking the tiniest bit of data and Stringing a tail based on this. Oh, it's remarkable, but I always feel compelled to to point out We scientists often have the the easy part of the job It's the engineers who really make this possible they they make the data possible yeah without their precision You don't get that millimeter per second velocity Difference that you're you're able to measure So that that's the the second piece of the puzzle. We're not yet out of notion that requires the third piece of the puzzle Uh a liquid water ocean right because given the first two pieces it could just be all ice that's right exactly and um So a third piece of the puzzle I like to make the analogy to adhering to airport security Okay, what the heck do I mean by that what do you mean? So uh for the moment disregard those big cylinders that we sometimes now have to walk in and you know Feel like being zapped in the thousand ways Uh go back to those doorways the traditional metal detectors When you're at an airport and you're walking through one of those Doorway structures You're passing through a pulsating time varying magnetic field That time varying magnetic field gives rise to electric currents in any conductor that you might have in your pocket or on your person Those induced electric currents as we know from Faraday and and uh enm those induced electric currents give rise to induced magnetic fields And within the little doorway there are Magnetic There are sensors to detect induced magnetic fields So you walk through with a conductor in your pocket that gives rise to induce electric currents Which gives rise to induced Magnetic fields and the alarm goes off. Yeah, we've all been there all been there then you get the pat down you miss your flight So with the Galileo spacecraft The alarm went off The Galileo spacecraft had on board a magnetometer a fancy compass and as it flew by Europa Uh, it detected an induced magnetic field It had long been measuring Galileo the Galileo spacecraft had long been measuring Jupiter's magnetic field and From that data we knew that Jupiter Jupiter's magnetic field is tilted by nearly 10 degrees From Jupiter's rotational axis exactly and so if you're Europa Jupiter's magnetic field has a time varying component Mm-hmm. So the Galileo spacecraft had mapped that out reasonably well and As it flew by Europa on a handful of occasions it detected an induced magnetic field What the heck could be giving rise to an induced magnetic field Oh Europa did not have a standard dipole the way the earth does it did not have an intrinsic field it had this induced field Well, you could say um, maybe the time varying component of Jupiter's magnetic field is interacting with Europa's iron core Iron's a good conductor. Yeah, that makes sense maybe that's maybe answer. Yes. That's off the along Well, you do the math and modeling and I did a lot of this uh number of years ago and and tried to fit things The core is just too small and too far away Mm-hmm. What about that rocky mantle? Uh turns out that rocks silicate rocks are not conductive enough to explain the data But what fits the induced magnetic field data of Europa beautifully is a near surface conducting layer Now from piece number one and piece number two We know that that near surface region of Europa is water in some phase. Right And so The best answer to the induced magnetic field data at Europa is a salty liquid water ocean the salt provides the conductivity that explains what by itself would not work But salty water would work exactly. Yeah, and liquid water is better than ice. That's right. Yeah You know, you can kind of Play around with some mushy ice scenarios, but even in that You're essentially on an ocean anyway. I mean, it's it's it's both remarkable that we can say all that about a little dot in the sky The Galileo looking to tell us go. It's also Very vivid that we could be wrong Right, I mean like you said we never know for sure. There's a lot of great evidence, but Presumably the clipper will give us much more evidence. That's right. What year is that coming? Well, so um Hopefully the mission will get to the launch pad in the 2023 to 2025 time frame. Okay I their launch would hopefully get us out to J.O.I. Jupiter orbit insertion and ultimately flybys of Europa in the late 2020s, okay and A lot of that uncertainty is in what launch vehicle we actually go on that it could be roughly five years to get there Yeah, um, you know on the low end closer to three and a half four on the higher end closer to six and a half seven. Okay Let me pause for a moment to talk about policy genius.com Those of you who know about my interest in the arrow of time understand that the past is something we can understand from memories and records Whereas the future is upper grabs. We can do things today that lead to good outcomes or bad outcomes And furthermore things can happen to us that we would consider to be good or bad We can't control the future perfectly But what we can do is hedge our bets and that's where insurance comes in Whether it's life insurance home insurance auto insurance and so forth when the worst happens You have a policy there that will help you out the trick is choosing the right policy And that's where policy genius comes in policy genius is a way to look at many different offers from different life insurance companies Choose the one that is best for you the policy genius team can handle all the paperwork and all the red tape It takes the worry out of choosing the best life insurance for you So even if you think you've made mistakes that have led to bad things You'll never be distressed about life insurance with policy genius in just a few minutes You can find your best price and apply at policy genius.com And then the Lander if let's say that everything works and you get the lander you get the money you get the launch date When would that be arriving at Jupiter? This is your baby right this is your thing. You should know each other quick snappy answer to this sadly sadly There is no plan for a Europa right now, but 20 30s let's say the 20 30s. That's right. Yeah, okay ideally But um, but yeah, we're we're and even that does not have a drill that's going to go through the ice That's going to land on the surface. That's right. So the pathway is Flyby land and then get deeper into the subsurface Before we can do a melt probe or something that gets into the ocean directly We need to do a lot of ground truth and and directly get onto the surface of a world like Europa or unsupload us to To see how hard that surface is what it takes to drill or melt into it How thick the ice truly is in the region of where we want to someday go through and I should say that Um As great as the remote sensing Will be The clipper mission is a habitability mission will be able to further constrain the the ocean the ocean chemistry the ice shell chemistry And the geology But unless Europa is extraordinarily generous with her evidence Which nature sometimes is not right We're not going to find signs of life with a remote sensing mission sure to Detect biosignatures You need to get on the surface. I mean there is a theory that at least some people have that you could detect Really really complex molecules and even if you didn't know that they had some particular biological function You might say there's no non-organic way of making that is that something that's feasible with just a clipper That's true and so clipper has on board Two very capable mass spectrometers one of which I'm a co-investigator on And these are really exciting instruments um and we hope to fly similar instruments Through the plumes of Enceladus someday and in both case whether it's flying through the plumes of Enceladus or perhaps a plume on Europa Instruments such as those mass spectrometers Could give us an inventory of organic compounds carbon compounds That provide compelling evidence for um Highly selective Process that might Point to biology because really at the end of the day Biology is selective and a biotic processes for generating carbon compounds Is not so you basically go from a plason distribution to a A picket fence sorry. This is your fancy scientist way of saying if it's not organic You get a lot of light if it's not biologicals. It's not biologicals I use organic in the in the casual way but But you scientists just mean carbon when you say organic I understand yeah carbon chemistry Uh, so if it's not biologicals there because carbon dioxide of course is carbon chemistry and that's not organic Okay, hydrocarbon chemistry um Ah the scientist man. This is why I don't want to have scientists on my podcast. They're just too picky But anyway, you could imagine lots of sort of random crazy non-biological Chemical reactions that would occasionally spit out a long molecule But only in the presence of many many tiny molecules whereas a truly biological thing might give you this Anomalously large concentration of really long molecule and coupled with that so Life as we know it The it's really hard to pin down some of the the fundamentals of life as we know what do we think would be universal For the most part Uh, the community biologists Astrobiologists etc There's a general convergence on Biology however you frame it is selective it will form larger molecules by utilizing a pool of smaller subunits in the case of life on earth that is um For proteins proteins RNA DNA right exactly so Not randomly chosen collections of carbon molecules. Right and so if you take RNA DNA proteins and just break them up You're going to see a pattern that has a fundamental unit based on say amino acids linked together one two three So on and so forth right So it's just not a random smattering yeah now back to Alien oceans and and having missions that could fly through plumes on Europa or in cellulose Absolutely there could be some incredibly compelling evidence But even after that you're going to want to land oh yeah, no, then you don't want to land more than ever Yeah, that's true and uh and with those chemical analyses You're not actually going to see the life You're not going to be able to put that under a microscope Until you get down to the surface and grab a scoop of it And one of the things that makes me nervous about depending on fly by missions For analyzing say plume material Is the small quantities that you actually get as you fly through a plume And when we talk about flying through a plume on in cellulose or Europa It's not like flying through old faithful up in Yellowstone or even a with the fires here in LA Right or even a snow-making machine at a ski resort These plumes at the fly by altitudes of say 50 kilometers or so They're very diffuse and so you're collecting nanoleaders To in a good day microleaders of sample Whereas if you're on the surface you're collecting like a full scoop worth of material And it's hard to know what you found. I mean I was a kid you were a kid When the Viking landers landed on Mars and we all thought they were going to tell us whether There was life and they did some chemistry experiments and the answer is Yeah, you know like it's maybe there's some hints, but we don't know However, so so the Viking was a phenomenal mission in the 70s. Oh my goodness. In the 70s. So I like to Compare the Viking missions and and the the incredible achievement of the Viking missions That's the sort of robotic uh Pioneering work that was done in the in the 70s. That is analogous to putting humans on the moon. Yeah, right It's a miracle that NASA did that back in the day When it comes to Viking and life detection There's a really important nuance that often gets lost in the in the mix And when I talk about Europa lander Viking often gets thrown back at me from the naysayers who don't like astrobiology who don't like the search for land They say, yeah, you don't know what you're looking for and the Viking failed and it killed the Mars program for decades And that is a tremendously false read of history for for a number of different reasons But scientifically what's really important to appreciate is that the Viking biology payload Was largely designed to look for Living microbes. Yeah microbes that were cooking along Debrisely metabolizing exactly drinking. Yeah, right and so the the Viking lander Again miraculously scooped up some sample poured it into a little agar plates little you know sugar water essentially And did a host of different experiments looking at Consumption of gases release of gases label Uh some of the gases were were isotopically labeled All of those results required microbes to actually be living and metabolizing and As we know that's that's hard to do even in the lab. Yeah, and so it was a tremendous achievement, but The way in which we search for biology now is to look for um the chemistry of life the structures of life um and on Viking The measurement the instrument that kind of Put to rest some of the ambiguous results about the the metabolic experiments Was the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer Which did not detect Any organic compounds at the level of parts per billion And so the conventional wisdom is If you ain't got any carbon you ain't got life yeah at least in terms of searching for life as we know it And so the the GCMS results um Supercited any ambiguity on the on the biology but this this gets into what I really wanted to you know Use this opportunity for is to talk about what life is or might be I mean you're looking for life in the solar system um We don't know a lot about what it is previously on the podcast We've had Kate Audemalla talking about making synthetic life in the lab We had Sarah Walker talking about what life is from in sort of information theory perspective Let's get down and dirty with like the chemicals and the and what might be going on So how do you conceptualize what life might be when you're imagining what we should do to look for? Yeah, it's a great question with Mirrored of ways to answer and uh first and foremost um um When it comes to searching for signs of life be it on Mars Within alien oceans of the outer solar system on on Europa and celilus Titan etc Or on extra solar planets or with with steady signals Um, I think it's really important to not get too precious about life. Mm. Uh, what do I mean by that? Well um uh The search for life comes under incredible scrutiny sometimes very valuable scrutiny But oftentimes that scrutiny is disproportionate to the way in which other scientific questions come come under scrutiny And that's in part because uh, we I think In view this question with a certain amount of preciousness. Yeah We take the answer seriously, but look I'm certainly someone who thinks that both the investigation of how life started and our search for it is Way underfunded and emphasized within the scientific community excellence Preaching the converted it's an official mindscape position But we should spend more money and effort understanding where life came from but but let me give an example um Ingeology What is a mineral? Yeah, okay, but fine Still operationally you're building instruments. Right. You need an answer even if it's not the perfect. That's right So uh if we can remove sort of the precious layer of how we think about life and biology um Uh Then we get to some operational approaches and fundamentally Life is a layer on top of Geology life alleviates chemical disequilibrium in the environment To accelerate the increase in entropy And I don't need to tell you that we love increasing entropy is our favorite though But to that end life does it in a very chemically specific way By harnessing The energy available in chemical systems to do work the free energy as we say energy exactly And so that's in the sorry, I mean You and I know what that means, but just to be clear you know very roughly speaking for those of you who have read from eternity to here You know that if the system has energy you can roughly divide it into useful energy and useless energy right the useless energy is just all entropy and temperature Useful energy that you can do work with that's the free energy we're talking about here right and and it gives free energy So Josiah Willard Gibbs Huge fan He's one of these vastly underappreciated physicists one of the first grade American scientists 100% and Okay, can we divert into Gibbs for over yeah, I'm just saying you know no one's these electrons are free So yeah Gibbs just vastly underappreciated these incredibly humble and and just kind of lived a very simple life at at Yale You know none of the As much as I love Einstein Einstein sort of established the crazy physicists Archetype right yeah And so some of that persists and like in order to be a genius and brilliant you must have something weird It's not the crazy hair you must have crazy tattoos et cetera et cetera And tell me that's so artificial Gibbs was just an ordinary guy with great thoughts and And so I find his He's very refreshing to read about Gibbs and well and we're still thinking about the significance of these concepts for ideas like the origin of life So I can say and I will agree that it makes sense that one of the things life does is Turn this free energy into higher entropy energy It's not completely clear that there's laws of law physics that says that that should happen or under what condition it would happen or is it probable So that's what we have to sort of empirically figure out that's right and so Yeah, let's dive in the Gibbs free energy for a minute So as you said you can think about energy in a couple of different ways the the heat and change in entropy Can't get much done with that And then there's the work and oftentimes when we think about work we think of pdv pressure and change in volume or Is a piston we're pushing it in there it pushes back we're doing work. Yeah, or you know to go to physics 101 we can think of Work is force times distance and force of course is ma or or mg in the case of planet earth And so when we think about the work done we can think of mgh mass times the gravitational acceleration times the Height to what you hold something and then yeah drop drop it Well Gibbs had this great insight in that you know Within chemical systems there should be some chemical equivalent to mechanical work and That chemical equivalent comes with something like chemical potential right and that chemical potential times the change in mass of a given compound within a system yields you some of that energy available to do Work so can we think of this as you know if you have hydrogen and oxygen in a bottle it has the ability to light on fire and do some work That's right and so Gibbs brilliance right so entropy is The how do you think about aggregations? I have where where do things aggregate And Gibbs obsessed over this Thankfully so yeah for us classiness emboltsman, etc. I had preceded him and and so He basically said well this this aggregation and the pressure and volume changes That's missing a certain aspect of how we do the full cost accounting for energy and changes in energy And Gibbs said well you know what if I have something like hydrogen and oxygen these two Parts and he and he and he loved to use this term new parts right so there are these new parts That get created from old parts so hydrogen and oxygen come together to make water And so in any given system you might have the initial parts Some compounds and then at the end you have new parts And so his addition to the energy equation Which folds into Gibbs free energy is that chemical potential For each compound for each chemical in that system to then react with other compounds and to form new parts So he really helped complete the full accounting for the conservation of energy. Okay, but we got to get from here to life somehow Right so I gave you that I gave you that digression But it's beautiful physics even for physics and I love it and I can go on yeah We All like learning new things the real problem is there are too many things out there to learn Not only does it take time learn any one of them But you have to choose which is the most interesting thing to dive into Blinkest is an app that will help you out with this It's basically a way boiling down nonfiction books and condensing them into just 15 minutes worth of reading You can read it get the general idea and move on or decide that you want to dig in more deeply That's what I really like about it. Not that it's a replacement for books But it's a way to decide which are the books that you really want to devote the time to There's a set of wonderful titles. They have such as the biological mind by Alan Jassinov Digital Darwinism by Tom Goodwin or the science of storytelling by Will store right now for a limited time Blinkest has a special offer just for mindscape listeners go to blinkest.com slash mindscape and you get to try it free for seven days and save 25% off your new subscription That's blinkest b-l-i-n-k-i-s-t dot com slash mindscape to start your seven-day free trial and also save 25% off But only when you sign up at blinkest dot com slash mindscape Okay, so Back to life and why the heck life arises um And here I I'm talking just about life as a chemical system. Yep certainly there is life in silico It's all sort of kind of broad But strictly speaking for life as a chemical process that we currently call biology I think it is if you allow me to use a loaded term. I think it is motivated by that That Requirement of the universe to increase energy entropy and in so doing alleviate chemical dizzy equilibrium and the environment yeah And so any place where you've got Gibbs free energy available Uh enzymes which and how you get to an enzyme is tricky but Inzymes allow you to overcome a bit of a hump to then release that stored chemical energy Right metaphorically. It's like the spark that could light the hydrogen oxygen on fire right there There's some ability for entropy to increase lurking there in the chemicals all around you But you have to allow it to get there somehow and That kind of enzymatic process is what you're saying leads to life Is life is life adjacent That's right and so um There are numerous hypotheses for the origin of life itself, but I think one of the Most compelling suspects in the story of how life arose perhaps on earth and then perhaps elsewhere Is the reduction of carbon dioxide? Um, how do you take carbon dioxide and pull off the oxygen and do something else with it? Uh, and sometimes this folds into the acetyl CoA pathway that is part of modern biology take your word for that but uh But early on Minerals may have been the sort of first catalytic environment that Were kind of the the the proto enzymes that allowed for the reduction of Things like carbon dioxide to then form Organic compounds and then to to be a template for self replication and eventually the formation of Vesicles that would someday be called cells. Yeah. I mean, I don't want to get too deeply into this because we got to talk about various moons in solar system but uh, I mean maybe the quick overview of metabolism replication compartmentalization the if the most important means for life Well, so I'm a metabolism firster and I think that Uh, and that's where Gibbs free energy comes into play uh, you need a motivation for Uh, the the energy dynamics of life and when you tell us the opposing school of thought Well um, I I don't think it's so much opposing. It's just a lot of different camps are trying to figure out where the inner section of um, metabolism Information storage and compartmental uh, compartmentalization all come together Everyone agrees you need these three things exactly people put different emphases on what is the crucial step right and replication and information Seems to me from my reading of the community to be the thing that most people are focusing on whereas you're saying you're a metabolism kind of guy right now um The information molecule side um, what many of us like to call the top downside uh, it's kind of low hanging fruit We have the information molecules. We know what RNA and DNA are they're in a snout right and so we can look at the RNA world You know the idea that the earliest information molecule was some form of RNA or or poly nucleic acids PNAs etc uh, but the the ladder down stops at those PNAs to you mean Down to simpler and simpler Right, right so top down approach you can climb all the way down to poly nucleic acids and variations therein But how do you actually bootstrap from where do you get them from just from kind of swatching around in an warm small pond right? Yeah, um, and so as much as I love the miller-yuri experiments Which were yeah, I get getting amino acids and then some more complex compounds from a spark discharge experiment that Had some pretty simple compounds like methane and water and ammonia in it You then get amino acids and some of the building blocks of life Amazing right just mind blowing back in the 50s, right? So yeah, so as I recall that was I mean basically the conclusion is It's not that hard to make amino acids out of random junk And they thought well, yeah tomorrow will do proteins then we'll do DNA but that there's a little mouse is gonna run out of lab exactly Much harder yeah, and that it's From that progression in the 1950s to now where of course we've had the genetic revolution Leslie or gal and others really spearheaded the RNA world and and that was phenomenal work and then In 1977 going back to Viking right so a year after Viking lands Hardothermal vents are discovered Here on earth here on earth not on Mars More Europa for them But so much happened in the late 1970s. It's it's just one of my favorite scientific periods And but so high-dothermal vents are discovered under the ocean And then the hydrothermal vent is right so hot springs at the bottom of the ocean New oceanic crusts is forming or fractures in the oceanic crust are allowing chemical reactions to proceed that um drive hot water and all sorts of interesting chemistry And so Part of what was exciting about the discovery of the hydrothermal vents is that along with the astonishing ecology the biology that was found there the two worms this is warsid fish the muscles etc these also Started to become recognized as cauldrons for interesting mineralogical and potentially organic chemistry To serve as a place where Processes perhaps related to the origin of life could occur And part of that is simply you know life is dynamical you don't want you're not going to imagine that life forms in a Something is just sitting there stationary you need some shake up something that is knocking things around and hopefully falling into good patterns right and and one of the things that I do like about the heart-othermal vents Model for the origin of life is um It's motivated by a metabolism first approach You've got compounds coming out the the fluids are full of Things like hydrogen and methane compounds that have electrons they just want to give away Energy energy coming back to Gibbs free energy right and there are minerals that also want to give away electrons And then the ocean around it wants to accept those electrons. So there's a lot of really compelling chemistry that occurs around hydrothermal vents The downside and the argument that's often put against hydrothermal vents is all that damn water Water is not deadly and you're right well, but it is to certain chemical reactions right so When you link two amino acids together that process that polymerization Spits out a water molecule So if you're linking two amino acids together in a liquid water environment You're trying to introduce a new water molecule into a place that's full of water molecules That's not particularly advantageous right chemistry doesn't like to proceed in that direction And that's where many of my colleagues who do brilliant work on like warm tide pools on the Flanks of some ancient continent where you can lap up some Primordial soup and then it gets baked in the sun and desiccated You know that desiccation process That's a much better environment for Concentrating things and linking things together and they showed it on Star Trek that that was how life formed here on Earth So it must be true yeah now so those are kind of There are different camps as far as information first metabolism first compartmentalization And then layered on top of there is a venn diagram of Environments that we see here on earth hydrothermal vents tide pools hot springs other things What I find so exciting about these alien oceans beyond earth these worlds like Europa and Saladis and Titan Is that we can just do this experiment yeah, right? Well, we've done it a handful of times. Let's put it that way right what do you mean we've done I mean the the solar system has done it exactly Right, so the solar system is is running these experiments. Yeah, we can go into our own backyard our own solar system backyard And just look in the ice and then the oceans of these these Ocean worlds of the outer solar system. It's a hey You got life life originate there. Yeah, and I do think these worlds are are great places for Second independent origins of life. So let me see if I have the picture I mean we know that certain things are necessary the compartmentalization the replication the metabolism We know they're all necessary, but we don't know the order or what led to what or anything like that. There's various hypotheses And part of the problem is even though we have a lot of life currently on earth and even very simple organisms It's still a stretch to say what the first organisms were like right like we can't definitely say that so If we were able to look at other Environments where there was also the possibility these things going on we could learn a lot That's right and this is where It's just beautiful. We have a chance to look at what is contingent and what is convergent in biochemical evolution um is DNA RNA and protein chemistry the only game in town yeah If you run the clock again Does biochemistry converge on that solution? So what's the answer? We got to go to your own now, but what do you think you think the DNA is necessary for life? So so here's what I can say with confidence that that um uh I love Mars. I love doing Mars exploration. It's a it's a beautiful world um, but but um There are two things First and foremost our search for life on Mars is primarily a search For life in the past as preserved in the rock record And large because there was running water on Mars, right? Mars had a wet and watery past so warmer past um And we think that Mars was definitely habitable And I for one think that Mars Most likely had life I Based on what I know of life on earth I Would predict that if the origin of life is easy It's big it's right, but if you grant me that then Uh Mars had life and there should be evidence of life on Mars I would argue that we have strictly zero information about whether it was easy or Because our existence does not count that's right, but what's the best way to get Uh to turn that from zero to non-zero right look somewhere else or there was exactly that's right Okay, but so but you did say you bet that Mars probably had life for you You think we have a lot of evidence that it had the condition right now the problem is that let's say we go to Mars And we find some beautiful rocks and beautiful stromatolites rocks that preserve the Perhaps the microbial fabric or fossils um DNA RNA large information molecules do not last for a long time in the rock record um Now in the subsurface of Mars there could be living life and and I would be thrilled to go and explore Mars for that but even if we found DNA based life on Mars Occam's razor would still tell me I can't quite count on that as a second origin Because earth and Mars too close too close, you know neighbors planetary buddies just sending stuff back and forth Swapping bodily fluids. Yep, you know throwing the baseball You know that's right impacts uh And thanks we have you know uh meteorites from Mars here on earth and people look for evidence of life in them exactly This isn't just speculation we actually have examples The outer solar system is much harder to um Say contaminate with with earth rocks or or Mars rocks And so if we went to Europa or in solidus or Titan with a robotic vehicle and we found DNA based life That to me would strongly point to a second independent origin with a convergent biochemical evolution towards DNA And that was just would be phenomenal. Can you name at least one plausible alternative to DNA? No No, I wish I could but we admit that that might just be our lack of imagination That's right um now Steve Benner In Florida has done some beautiful experiments on Adding additional base pairs so there are some interesting synthetic biology experiments that have been done I've heard about I think the kato and i'm all also talked about this. Yeah, so the four the gcta Yep might not be the whole alphabet That's right It's not the whole alphabet in terms of you can you can push At least in the lab The DNA molecule to to have added base pairs Is that biologically acceptable? Yeah, we don't know that those experiments it hasn't gone from Cool chemistry to actual biology, but it's it's really compelling. Okay, so we will If these have the ability to ask so there's one thing that we could learn I mean obviously the fact that we if we learn that there's life elsewhere That's the big thing the second thing is is a DNA RNA similar kind of chemistry I'm sure that some people in the audience are thinking isn't it too cold out there to have life like way beyond the orbit of Mars Yeah, yeah, yeah, why are you even talking about these moves? They're not the Goldilocks zone That's right. So this comes back to the fundamental Game-changing aspect of these ocean worlds beyond earth Europa Ganonade calisto three moons of Jupiter Titan and Enceladus two moons of Saturn and even Neptune's curious moon Triton These are worlds where liquid water is maintained and sustained uh in large part through tidal dissipation tidal energy pumping and stretching and then Heating these worlds from the interior These moons are orbiting jaihi among us. Exactly. So everybody knows and loves the tides on earth On Europa You're dealing with a Europa is about the size of our moon But Europa is orbiting Jupiter which is some 318 times as massive as the Earth And Europa is just getting tugged and squeezed like a ball of taffy and it's The predictions are that if you stood on Europa You might rise and fall in the diurnal cycle the daily up and down which is equivalent to 3.55 Earth days You might rise and fall with the tides Uh about 30 meters or nearly 100 feet per year open day All right, so take your drame I mean if you're gonna visit Europa But that's yes, that's injecting a lot of energy into the ice right It's it'll be almost crazy to think that some of it wouldn't heat up and make a liquid water. That's right. So um The traditional habitable zone the the way we normally thought about planets in the early days of astronomy and planetary science was that The habitable zone is defined by the distance from your parent star and habitability was conceived of as having a liquid water ocean On your planet's surface in contact with a nice atmosphere and then you're off to the races. Yeah and in that kind of Conception of the habitable zone you had this at least an arsola system Goldilocks scenario where Venus Earth and Mars were kind of like those little bowls of porridge in the Goldilocks store Venus is too close to the Sun gets too much energy Any water that at once had got baked out. It's too hot Mars too far away too cold any water that it's once had frozen Now the story of Venus and Mars is much more complicated or complicated right? It's had this years matter And uh and they they had points in the past did have liquid water But at least in the modern epic planet Earth is in that Goldilocks zone Where it has liquid water on the surface in contact with our nice thick atmosphere And the reason we have that ocean our ocean is uh because of energy from the the Sun from our parent star What these ocean worlds of the outer solar system are teaching us is that there's another way to get the business of maintaining and sustaining liquid water done tidal energy dissipation and And in part coupled with radiogenic decay in other words the decay of heavy elements uranium thorium even potassium provide enough internal heat So as to keep some liquid water liquid And on Europa we think that the tidal energy dissipation could lead to An ocean a global liquid water ocean of some 100 kilometers in depth That's 60 miles in depth That's ten times the depth of the Mariana trench the deepest region in our own ocean and And and and so that tidal energy is is really Changing the way we think about habitable environments in our own solar system Would it almost always be the case that Throughout the universe not just the solar system as we know it these kinds of oceans So basically there's there's two possibilities one is you're heated by the star and you're like the Earth The other is you're a satellite of a giant planet and regardless of what the star is doing you're heated by these tidal stresses With those with that second option always come with an ice sheet around it Yeah, so for the most part And the answer is yes, I'll get to tighten in a second because tighten also has an atmosphere But I do want to give the heavy elements the the credit that they're due And radiogenic decay Can last for a long time Pluto We're still kind of understanding Pluto as this beautiful Dynamic world who cares if it's a planet or a dwarf planet or what have you if I just love it as a world Uh Pluto may well have a liquid water ocean perhaps with some The monior other anti-freeze mixed in Uh, and if Pluto does in fact have a liquid water ocean It is sustained through the trickling out of heat from the decay of these heavy radiogenic elements coupled with that There's interesting Thermal physics associated with ice shells um All of these ocean worlds rely on ice being a good insulator ice is a great blanket um But there are different kinds of ice that serve as better blankets than others So on Europa and celilus Um, that's Ice one ice that that We can grab out of our freezer. Yeah, the sort of traditional ice And if you've ever built a snow forter, you know, walked into an igloo or something like that You know, then you can actually stay pretty warm if you're surrounded by by frozen water I'm told that it's the snow that does the insulating not the ice well, yes, but even um Ice itself my best igloo experience coming in here Yes, so so snow the porous material is definitely better, but even ice itself is not Gotcha is not a tremendously good conductor of of heat um But then there's this other aspect Clathrates so a kind of ice that reconfigures to trap various molecules Clathrate means cage or to to engage And so on Pluto The ice of Pluto the water ice is mixed with nitrogen and methane and Perhaps some ammonia and stuff and that mixture may help Pluto Have a better thermal insulation to keep its ocean from there could be life on Pluto's what you tell me well So okay, yeah, better cells dream a little bit right right so the No Because I saw the Rick and Morty episode they're very upset that they've been demoted from planet status. Oh, I have not I've not seen that but so we're Pluto kind of fall short is um In uh the way I like to frame this is the the keystones for life are You need liquid water You need the elements to build life and to the best of our knowledge life as we know it at least needs a smattering of of 54 elements from the periodic table The most significant of which are the the chenobs the carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur Then you need iron and some some heavy elements And then the third keystone is you need some energy and that comes back to the Gibbs free energy. Yeah, some chemical this equilibrium Europa and insolidus and perhaps even Titan I think satisfy those three keystones. I think The oceans of Europa and insolidus um Are mixing with a rocky sea floor That rocky sea floor gives rise potentially to hydrothermal vents Which gives rise to the elements needed to build life and the energy needed to power life Pluto Might have a lot of the compounds and water needed for satisfying the liquid water keystone and potentially the energy keystone Methane as I mentioned is a good molecule and so life could eat or make that Part of what I worry about with Pluto is whether or not it's got enough of the heavy elements whether or not it's got enough of the problem Yeah, yeah, but its density is sufficient to indicate that there's got to be some rock for action You seem to hint that Titan was a weirdo also Titan is my favorite place to search for Weird life weird life Unlike life as we know I'm gonna qualify any life is not on earth as pretty weird But you mean you mean substantially different that's right so uh and here's where Coming back to kind of an operational approach to searching for life Here's where we can start to slice and dice things in in a very pragmatic way When I look out at Europa and insolidus and and Titan also has a liquid water ocean beneath its icy shell And that ocean may be mixing with with rocks um I can generate an hypothesis About the prospects for carbon and water-based life Out there in our solar system, right? And that hypothesis is Founded on observations of life here on earth so Life on earth is water and carbon-based water is the solvent carbon is the key building block And we can look at all the extreme environments on earth and article the hydrothermal vents etc saying okay Water and carbon-based life Is tenacious is a little bit of life everywhere on earth and yeah, I mean I do whenever people say that I feel like raising my hand and saying it's not equally hospitable to life all these different environments, right? I mean there's less life that's right in the desert and Antarctica than there is in the rainforest 100% okay, but there's a little bit of life. There's a little microbial life that that's right and Please be aware that oftentimes as when I talk about The search for life and and life on earth As beautiful as the penguins were in Antarctica the giraffes of the African Savannah or etc Multicellular life metazones these larger creatures are boring as hell ah The reason for that is because we all just resent Represent the tiniest of twig on the vast genetic tree of life. Yeah, not a lot of diversity within right the metazone for all of the the shape diversity we all our hetero tropes where we eat carbon compounds and breathe oxygen to Essentially do a fancy campfire burn right from from penguins to to sea slugs to giraffes We're all doing the same metabolic process. Whereas microbes microbes Holy cow They have figured out a way to eat anything and everything From acids to bases to you know and doing it at high pressures low pressures. You name it Which is extraordinarily reassuring for the search of life for life exactly and so when I talk about the diversity of life on earth and how we use our Study of life on earth to provide a bridge for assessing habitable environments beyond earth. It's it's in that microbial context Okay, so we're not gonna find penguins on the ice shelf of Europa Um, well Birds come on I Don't I wouldn't rule out octopi or things like abstract from Titan. Yeah, we're gonna be in the way of life so the We can make an Hypothesis about water and carbon-based life on Europa and in solace and even within the water ocean of Titan And that water and carbon hypothesis is rooted in our understanding of how microbial life works on earth The those oceans If you transported microbes on earth to those worlds The evidence that we have today would indicate that those microbes could survive So we can we can design spacecraft to test that hypothesis of Water and carbon-based life waters of solvent carbon as the building block Titan Along with having this Debotion beneath its icy crust also has this crazy methane cycle uh, the surface Temperature and pressure of Titan so the the atmosphere is thick on Titan. It's primarily nitrogen um, but the the temperature and pressure of Titan is such that methane Exists In all three phases Solid liquid and triple point exactly so solid liquid and gas similar to Where earth resides in terms of its surface being at the triple point of water And so Titans got these seasonal cycles going on and it's raining down methane and methane and potentially larger organics And on its surface the Cassini spacecraft help reveal all of these Methane dominated lakes and seas And this is where things get weird A lake of methane a lake is already pretty weird. Yeah. Yeah, and uh, so Could you have weird life on Titan Where the solvent the the the thing that the parts of life get mixed and combined in the you know on earth That's water where the solvent is liquid methane Uh, I don't know the answer to that question Yeah, nobody really does chemically the difference between liquid methane and liquid water is that Water is a polar solvent and methane is non-polar Water molecules have a slight positive and negative charge on them due to the way in which the electrons arrange themselves in the the two hydrogens and oxygen Methane does not have methane is like a perfect little tetrahedron And so in chemistry like dissolves like so water is very good at dissolving other polar compounds That's in part what allows the the chemistry of our biology to work And of course as you know from mixing oil and water Oil is for the most part Non-polar and it yeah, separate sounds. Yeah, that's kind of useful. That's kind of useful right now If you flip the tables and have a non-polar solvent like methane Could you get enough interesting chemistry done to really drive biochemistry? Yeah, you know, there is water there It would be different it would be different um And thankfully Last year last summer if yeah, my memory serves everything the blur Uh NASA selected a mission to get back out to Titan it's this phenomenally exciting mission called dragonfly Pied by my friend zippy turtle and and it's out of the applied physics laboratory in Maryland This is a mission which Hopefully will launch in 20 in the mid-2030s um I'm sorry it'll get out to Titan in the mid-2030. Okay. I'll say this way out there It's hard to play in that far but okay too many missions uh So it gets out to Titan in the mid-2030s Parachutes down to the atmosphere gets rid of its heat shield and all that and then Starts turning on these rotors So just like the quad drones that you see and yeah, somewhat annoyingly grown to tight right yeah, so we're sending a drone There's anyone to Mars also I know that's right now the Mars helicopter has got um It's just got one Set of rotors on it um The Titan dragonfly mission is much larger. It's the size of a of a dining room table and Along with looking at the geology and geochemistry of Titan looking at the dunes and all the interesting things that are happening In the the world of Titan We're also going to be looking for signs of life if you get shot down by ornery locals. That'll be a great success, right? As long as we get a picture then before they're together there's a camera on the drone. I hope right So yeah, so it's uh It's it's just a beautiful mission and and what's fun about Titan uh my Friend and then brilliant scientist and engineer Ralph Lorenzo's done this calculation where if you could survive on Titan As a human a lot of caveats there. Yeah, and kind of have your own icarus wings You could fly because it low gravity thick happens exactly Glad that calculation was done. Yeah, tax fair dollars at work. Yes So put that part that in part Helps lead to the the viability of doing a rotor craft Mission that will be laying on Titan and search for signs of life. Wow. Now primarily With that mission and I'm a co investigator on that mission We'll be looking for evidence of perhaps water-based life that has been erupted from below But we'll also have our eye towards the the discovery driven aspect of science. Yeah What if yeah, what if there there is life that has originated and evolved in these methane ethan rich lakes is the trick that we don't even know how to look for that So I mean it to design an experiment. It's actually looking for certain chemicals right and Here again, we come back to that issue of um specificity life being very selective um We think that even if life is based on some chemistry Unlike life as we know it even if life is Weird compared to the to the liquid water and carbon-based life that we know it will still have that Selectivity and specificity where it is built on fundamental Chemical units. It'll like certain molecules more than others And so if you do an inventory with something like a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer You might see a pattern even in weird life That distinguishes it from Kind of the aortic processes that are just random and kind of linked together Adams by atoms. I suppose we should put in a word for Enceladus. That's the other place Phenomenal yeah, I mean when I hear people talk they're they're more I mean there are certainly people who think that of all these Enceladus is the one that is the most likely to have life I know you might not be in that Enceladus partisans and like these These worlds are all beautiful and and the meritorious of ex-lager children. Yes, you know that um in celadus Just to calibrate Enceladus is the new kid on the block the new shiny object, right? And so the Cassini mission just ended and we have a lot of new data on in celadus and so um There's a lot of excitement about Enceladus and Enceladus was very generous wonderfully so so Enceladus Be coming back to Europa and the discovery of Europa's ocean That took that kind of detailed physics The Galileo spacecraft did not observe any plumes erupting out of in Europa's eye shell We now think we've got some some curious evidence using the Hubble Space Telescope and some some Galileo data for Water-rich plumes coming out of Europa But when Cassini flew by Enceladus Bang there it was these plumes erupting out of the icy surface of Enceladus Now initially um skeptics myself among them um viewed those plumes is perhaps just a Devolta the tie the Devolta the talcitation of the ice and clathrate's perhaps and other things Uh, we see jets of material Elsewhere in our solar system. Uh, we see comets. Sure producing jets so early on Some of the evidence for Enceladus could have been explained by um, these plumes Being analogous to commentary jets where something's just causing outgassing But as the Cassini spacecraft flew by and tasted the the plumes of water It also revealed that the plumes have Methane and carbon dioxide a smattering of organics For me what really turned the tide was the discovery of salts Okay, what's the definition of assault so assault something with cations and anions Traditionally think of salt as like sodium chloride potassium chloride magnesium chloride magnesium sulfate all sorts of stuff where you can take a Positively charged cation and combine it with a negatively charged anion So So that means the life would be tasty Well So it's a wire assaults significant in terms of of evidence for an ocean on Enceladus uh If you just had water in the plumes of Enceladus And water mixed with carbon dioxide and methane and even small organics Those are all things that we see in comets Mm-hmm. Okay So no biggie in some sense no biggie in some sense now still very exciting. It's still cool, but yeah But we see him in there's a trillion comets in the oracle Exactly and comets the way we get those compounds like methane and some of the organics is through The ice having things like methane and potentially ammonia and then it gets photolytically processed UV light from the sun processes it and produces these larger organic compounds So at Enceladus you could be very conservative and say now this is an evidence of an ocean This is just photochemistry combined with some devolaticalization of the ice shell But with salts We don't really see salts on comets, right? salts are a harbinger of water rock interaction liquid water leaching through silicates, right So for me when the cosmic dust analyzer on Cassini returned evidence of salts That was okay now It was a sign of water not a sign of life, but once you have the water then maybe it's life appropriate, right? and so For me the the Cassini observation of the plumes and identifying that the plumes of Enceladus have salts that gives me A large degree of confidence that we're actually sampling plumes that are connected to a liquid water ocean below and do we have evidence that there's an icy Crest on the top of Enceladus. Yeah, yeah, absolutely that that goes back kind of to the first piece of the puzzle analogous to Europa And I should of course mention that for both Europa and Enceladus the geology of the icy surfaces point to very very young ice Very good because right something has to be resurfacing this material some sort of Geological cycling of the ice with something below repaves The ice of Europa and the ice of Enceladus to give you a surface with no craters, right? So it's not quiet It's not quiet, right now At Enceladus there's a As the story would unfold from Cassini Additional evidence would corroborate the the ocean hypothesis the moving of the ice shell a decoupled ice shell a shell that is Kind of free flowing and disconnected from a from a rocky interior That was observed on Enceladus. Okay, you didn't know that so that really cinches the deal in some sense Yeah, that's not a lot of relationship with layer in between the ice and the rock right um And then there is also evidence of hydrogen and other things that that actually point to potentially active heart of thermalism active heart of thermal activity within Enceladus even things like Silica nanograms have been discovered so the people who are very excited about Enceladus are not Just Whistling Tixie right and I'm incredibly excited about Enceladus here. Here's the rub on Enceladus though If you kind of do a Worn-for-one comparison with Europa So Keep in mind we're talking to the PI of the Europa Lander Well, not a PI because the Europa Lander isn't the Europa Lander's dead So they the oh it's dead It's a technology development effort. It's it's not well. Okay plan to go to the launch pad Yeah, in order to To get it to be a Europa guy Yes, but I'm an Enceladus guy too. I've published UnEnceladus not as much as Europa, but um, but just doing a a Again a full calibration yep Europa is 3000 kilometers in diameter. That's about the size of our moon It's a moon that we understand very well we um, I mean very well Given the data available We think that Europa has been around For the history of the solar system We think it formed around Jupiter as Jupiter was forming Uh, and we think that the ocean itself of Europa has been there For the history of the solar system billions of years. Yeah Um Now a couple that with that there's some interesting chemistry that occurs within Europa's i-shell and in your opus ocean and Well, hopefully get to that But Enceladus when it comes to this issue of time I mentioned the the keystones for habitability liquid water Elements and energy a Forth potentially fundamental keystone is time how long has that? Convergence of keystones been around Um Now that may not be important and maybe that life arises very quickly But if I were a betting man I would kind of more time the more chances right yeah, and so uh, Enceladus There is a significant debate within the the planetary science community right now about First and foremost what makes Enceladus tick uh What's the full title energy uh evaluation for Enceladus and how long has Enceladus and its ocean been around And part of the kind of thread that people have pulled on is the the rings of Saturn Rings are not Particularly stable right so the rings of Saturn According to some you know they're again. This is a heavy debate. It's a wonderful debate. It's a beautiful debate This is why we love doing what we do But there's a camp in the Saturn community that says The rings of Saturn tell us that something big happened not too long ago Because otherwise those rings should have either collapsed been pulled into Saturn or been kind of Orbitaly evolved out. It's not too long ago might be millions of years not tens of millions of years So so the the time scale is geologic and uh Astronomical um But so uh, you know if some of the hypotheses are that maybe the the the rings of Saturn were created 100 million years ago by a kuiper belt object uh a Pluto size object Correigning into Saturn and hitting a large moon breaking it up creating the rings in a bunch of the small moons Etc and so there is a camp that says that The rings of Saturn are young and potentially some of the smaller moons including Enceladus could be quite young And if Enceladus and its ocean are young Then you know, I kind of view Enceladus as this like Fizzing alka-cells or tablet. That's uh that's perhaps doing incredibly interesting chemistry but um I kind of Am a little more interested in a stable world Like your robot that that we know has been around for a long time and this is this is good the issue of time because I would like to put everything in a bigger context here. I mean, I think that our listeners probably Are happy to say that microbes are awesome But what they would really like is little aliens flying around his patients right and we're not gonna find that in the solar system I think is most likely But maybe elsewhere in the universe So What can we learn from looking at these other places in the solar system that might tell us something about the likelihood of life Multicellular life intelligent life technological life elsewhere in the world right so This is a great question that actually folds into the second aspect of Europa and Enceladus and some of the The chemistry that I find very compelling about Europa that is potentially lacking at Enceladus And this comes back to Gibbs free energy and and redox chemistry the coupling of Reductance with oxidants And we touched on this earlier that a reducton is a compound that wants to give away an electron and Oxidant is a compound that wants to accept an electron And the way I like to think of any of my backgrounds and physics and and it's just Biochemical batteries and you connect the the positive and negative terminal on that the electrons flow exactly so Life alleviates chemical deceitful environment in the environment the same way that when you buy a battery at a Corner store That battery will store energy for a long time And it'll eventually trickle out but You can put that battery in a flashlight you can connect that battery to a circuit and allow those electrons to flow And in so doing you get work done You get the work of shining a light on something or running a little remote control car or what have you And the battery runs out a lot faster because you've completed the circuit Biology does that in our environment around earth there are all sorts of Geochemical batteries right and the microbes tap into that who was the biologist you said that life is just an electron looking for a place to rest I don't know but yeah, that's true. Yeah uh Friend and colleague Everett shock loves to say that um, you know the the energy is like um Being paid to eat a free lunch And so you know you're getting energy out of this this chemistry that's available in the environment and so Why is this important? How does this tie back to your question of of Squid in Europa Another aspect of what intrigues me about Europa potentially being a better place to search for life is the the chemistry of your opus ocean Hydrithromo vents active sea floors are great places for Reductance and we see that on planet earth hydrogen methane etc Pump out of our sea floor and microbes love the reductins But if all you have is the reductin if all you have is the negative terminal on the battery Yeah, the circuit's not complete nowhere for the electrons to go nowhere to go right So you need an accident you need a source of accidents And on earth a lot of the accidents or things like oxygen and sulfate etc etc and we've got tons of accidents On and sell it as it's not clear to me that It has a source of accidents So it could have an active sea floor pumping out the methane and hydrogen But if there's no good source of accidents Then it might be kind of game over From a Gibbs free energy standpoint from what life can utilize standpoint Europa has this beautiful but also somewhat frustrating surface environment Where by merit of being embedded in Jupiter's magnetic field Europa's icy surface is being bombarded by charge particle irradiation Electrons energetic electrons Tens of KV to tens of MEV electrons ions protons etc are corining into Europa's surface ice And that those that radiation chemistry that radiolytic processing Is splitting apart water in the simplest case Splitting apart H2O into things like H plus OH Some of the H escapes some of the hydrodynamic escapes And OH can combine with another OH To form H2O2 What is H2O2? Hydrogen peroxide Exactly the same stuff that you buy at a pharmacy to disinfect a cup We know Thanks to Bob Carlson and colleagues in the Galileo spectrometer That hydrogen peroxide Exists within the surface ice of Europa Further to that we also know that thanks to observations by John Spencer and Wendy Calvin using ground-based telescopes Oxygen oh two Exists within the ice of Europa Uh, and we know that things like sulfate and other very useful oxidants Exist within the ice of Europa in large part from that radiation processing So if the ice of Europa is getting mixed into the ocean below You now have this beautiful scenario where the radiation And the radiolytic processing of the surface ice Creates that positive terminal of the biochemical battery So if the oxygen peroxide sulfates etc get mixed into the ocean They could Be combined with reductants from the seafloor to help power life. Yep. Okay And so people often say well isn't the radiation of Europa surface problematic isn't it can destroy Evidence for life isn't gonna make landing there harder Yes, and yes But the upshot of that radiation is that it could also be central to that third keystone of life the energy component of life and sulfate micro absolve sulfate But as I mentioned oxygen is also a president present in Europa's ice Oxygen is critical to the emergence of Large multi-cellular life on earth. Okay, wait that was a big leap you just made it Good good I mean, dude don't we first need to make nuclear cells like right on actual earth Life happened pretty quickly multi-cellular life took forever. Well, I mean, I don't know if that happened quickly So let's so we know that life arose There's Debate about this, but um Some say that the first evidence for life is at the sort of 3.8 billion year billion years ago Point in time which would put it about 700 million years after the origin of the planet itself, you know 800 million years from that range More convincing evidence is available at three and a half to three point two billion years ago Then Multi-cellular life that utilizes oxygen That doesn't emerge until about 700 million years ago 650 million years ago 600 million years ago. Yeah, and took three billion years right And so a little micro was bumping into each other and that's right. I don't want to give it together with you and so there's this long period of um Those early metabolism and then the evolution of photosynthesis and the um You know people love to talk about life as Darwinian selection in survival the fittest etc um predator and prey and all that That's all well and good, but I also like to say that um Life is Also largely about acquisitions and mergers You know, symbiosis that's a place right and you know, it's just somewhat similar to economics Could you say it's about romance and love Go on Swiping left and swiping right But sure we can be capitalist about it good right so acquisitions emerges. What do I mean by that um? Well in the early days or horizontal gene transfer there's also to back and forth is like you know open source life was open source You know, you give me your code. I'll give you my code Unix red hat etc so So horizontal gene gene transfer dominated in the early days Then once things really started so but by what we mean for those who don't know it's not just that you Your little microbe and you split and you duplicate your genes and that's the only thing that happens with the occasional mutation But also literally you take in DNA from your neighbor or give it That's right exactly so it's crazy talk, but okay, you're looking at the biological github and you're Forking and splitting and whatever it is you do yeah Merging but then as things got a little more complicated you start to be more compartmentalized and less porous And then instead of just grabbing genes Those early microbes started to kind of subsume other microbes Bacteria gobbled up other or Kia or you know back then who knows what they actually qualified as right single-celled organisms Engulfed other organisms they acquired their capability just like you know a Google would acquire I don't know what the heck is Google acquiring Everything yeah, I don't know Some self-driving car. Yeah So this acquisition acquisitions and mergers strategy is very true in the The history of life on earth, but when did that happen when did that time yeah, so There's a lot of debate about the the time scales for when you When do mitochondria right and organelle which once upon a time was an independent Microbe when did that get incorporated when do um The cyanobacteria that Really did the business of photosynthesis when did they um get incorporated into other cells um and even the nucleus right there's there's a lot of debate about that and within the biology community Once upon a time there were pro-carriots and eukaryotes No nucleus and and you've got a nucleus But what the tree of life is telling us and what the study of life on earth is telling us is that um Yeah, there's a lot more that simple. I know. Yeah, never is that simple That's why you should do physics instead of biology F equals m a exactly. It's all you need But so fast forward to the emergence of multi-cellular life because I want to I want to get you the squids on your robot. I know uh Thankfully life on earth Begin to utilize the energy from the Sun our parent star and Was able to start converting the CO2 to oxygen And the initial stage of that pumping of oxygen into our atmosphere called the o- Cause the ocean to rust out um, you know essentially oxidizing a lot of the iron in our ocean forming what we now see as banded iron formations which Are where we go to mine iron um And then once the ocean rusted out we started building up oxygen in our atmosphere And once oxygen levels got to a sufficient level A few microbes started to realize that if they teamed up They could collaboratively utilize The oxygen and some of the organics in solution To do the metabolism that we now know and love and depend upon which is that heterotrophy of of Eating organics and burning them with oxygen. So you're saying that the transition to multi-cellularity was not just a bunch of random Bubbing into each other, but it was opportunistic Totally opportunistic think about it like if we go back to the battery analogy A lot of microbes Have figured out ways to survive on the tiniest of watch battery Methanogens and sulfate reducers operate with with tens of kilojoules per mole of a negative change in Gibbs free energy Compare that compare that to the the hundreds of kilojoules to thousands of kilojoules that are needed by larger organisms such as such as us And so yeah, it was an energetically opportunistic innovation to utilize the oxygen in the air as the oxygen and organics in the environment as the reductant So Europa so on Europa This in my dream of dreams um It's late in the podcast. We can dream a little bit of the butter hair down here, right? So the As I mentioned the the radiation processing produces oxygen in the ice and the ice of Europa is Geologically young way the surface of Europa globally is tens of millions of years old That's the that that's a you know a flash of a pan geologically speaking that's comparable to the age of our oceanic crust Here on earth and those are some of the youngest rocks on earth so On Europa If the ice is cycling into the ocean directly and that's a that's a significant if we don't know much about the conveyor belt type of Motion of the ice and what may or may not be happening Subduction subsumption also things like that But if the ice is delivering oxygen to Europa's ocean on a relatively short geological time scales Time scale you could have enough oxygen in Europa's ocean to support Organisms on earth you could get those concentrations That are found in some of the O2 minimizeones in earth ocean. I get it And there you find policite worms and so the motivation for multi-cellular life might be there on your Even without the sunshine. Yeah, so we should tell the audience you were a consultant on the movie Europa report Correct, and I'm not going to give away anything except that yeah, there's that they go to Europa and they find life Yeah, and I haven't seen the Europa report that the the um the writing team the production team the actors etc That was a great project to be a part of and you and I have worked on various movie consults together and had a lot of fun um That one was closer to the real science than most of the ones well, so you know I think you and I worked on Thor to go with Kenneth Brownow and we can come to that but for the most part I don't know what your opinion is but You know we can add suggestions and kind of try and guide the the vector of uh where it will go But at the end of the day, it's no big Rub on us if they don't exactly actually actually take our advice with the Europa report My colleague Steve Vance and I like oh well This is really close to home We care a little bit more without what's going on here. So if you do one as a guard So if you're gonna do this can you at least commit to us that you're gonna Try and get things right and they did they were absolutely brilliant I love the movie it was a low budget movie. They really did a very good job Like eight million dollars, you know the the um the Zero G stuff that they did a most large budget films good movie magic use of vomit comet to get zero G the brilliance of uh of that team they used green yoga balls And had the actors on their backs and on their stomachs Rolling on green yoga balls in the little capsule to um to to give the appearance of floating in space I love that kind of clever way of going about things. I think that uh, I mean I hope that there are the squid in Europa. I think that that would be very cool But let's sort of wrap things up with the lessons for Beyond this older system that we might get from the solar system I mean one obvious thing is if we found so let's say that we really do a good job at looking at Europa and celadus Titan and we either find life on all of them or on none of them How willing will you be then extrapolate that to lessons for the rest of the universe? Right This is a great and very important question so um If we do a robust exploration of the alien oceans beyond earth Europa and celadus Titan Pluto Triton you name it um We will either find evidence of life uh or or not I think Both answers are equally profound So if we find life then it's kind of off to the races the origin of life is easy Life should arise wherever the conditions are right Europa type worlds are potentially ubiquitous in our universe and um and we could live in a biological universe Conversely If we don't find evidence of life on these worlds That gives us Important information on hypotheses for the origin of life. Yeah, that would tell me that well the origin of life Most likely does not occur around hydrothermal vents and it does not occur in icy environments And and we didn't talk much about origins and ice, but that's a whole another thread Uh or it just almost never occurs Or it almost never occurs, but in the case of Not finding life in these alien oceans be on earth I would say then that the origin of life does require continents and The warm tide pools and the types of evidence for them right um so Europa has no continents There's no rivers and tide pools so Yeah, we can we can add to the information content Even with a null results And granted a null result would be hard to come by you'd have to explore pretty thoroughly, but um But you're willing to spend that money Well, and and the other thing is that you know, Europa's ocean and celilus is ocean. These are global oceans and so if you Sample in a few places the ocean flows around and you can at least have some confidence in the connectivity but um So then extrapolating to the So to our galaxy and the universe more broadly if we Don't find life in our own backyard if we don't find it on Mars or within these alien oceans Then I think we start to enter around where life on earth is a biological singularity it operates in the truest form of singularity where you know our evidence for life on earth would say that it is a layer on top of biology and Yeah, it gives free energy all these things should you know the laws of On top of chemistry on top of chemistry. Sorry. Yeah, they're they're so Physics is the base chemistry and geology of the layer there and then biology is sort of a fancy But you're saying that we have enough other opportunities to find life in this solar system that if we don't It really does suggest that maybe it's not that ubiquitous. That's right and that's continents and and and Earth-like worlds are required for the origin of life now Mars serves as a good template for that we if we do find evidence of life on Mars it could be a Standard bearer for life existing on another world but coming back to what we talked about earlier I would be reluctant to endow it with a Second origin. Yes, because of that that'd be tricky especially if we were very similar exactly And so Yeah, then we get to this issue of a biological singularity The laws of physics as we know it the laws of chemistry geology et cetera lead to chemical disequilibrium Gibbs free energy kind of being a motivator for the metabolism of life and life being Kind of a tool that the universe uses to increase entropy And to accelerate us to that entropic death But if it arises only on earth perhaps something else is sparking the the fire so What is your final question? What is your favorite solution to the Fermi paradox of why we have not seen life elsewhere We could imagine that life is rare That multicellular life is rare the technological life is rare or that technological life is everywhere and they're just not talking to us Do you have a favorite one of these? Right, so I'll answer this in two parts first and foremost and I worked at the Settians too many years ago and One of my favorite experiences as a as a young scientist was um approaching Frank Drake after a seminar and I was a young intern up at NASA Ames at the time and Yeah, it's my Dr. Drake you know Of the Drake equation. Yes I said yeah, I've long been thinking about all this stuff and and it's honored to meet you and all that stuff. I said well What do you think would be the the next intelligence species on planet earth if you fast forward the The time scales for what's happening on planet earth Without missing a beat he said squirrels and raccoons Really okay, and so I thought he was gonna say dolphins and whales and all this But uh shumps are squid right um, but The squirrels and raccoons in part because they are living and surviving and developing in such close proximity to the intelligence That currently exists. They're being selected for right cleverness right and that's why I love that answer but um With respect to the Fermi paradox My primary answer is we just have not done enough searching. I think it's a it's a um poorly framed paradox Well Fermi As I understand it the original version of the paradox was if you could build self-replicating probes They could fill the galaxy pretty quickly right we would notice that right the touring uh, yeah machines etc and uh And um You could populate the galaxy quickly um Would we see that Uh that is kind of a people kind of tuck that under the rug right um So I happen to think that The center of the Milky Way galaxy the is like Manhattan I Were eight and a half kiloparsecs out from the galactic bulge We're in the boondocks. You know, we're like in northern Canada Uh trying to connect to the internet or saying, you know, why can't we dial up? Fermi paradox is like, you know, why doesn't the internet exist? Oh well it does you're just on the right place you haven't you know, all right connected long enough um And so I do think that So it's there what we haven't found it yet. That's your favorite Well, I think we haven't searched in enough ways and in enough clever ways and by clever, I mean um We've got to cover more of the radio spectrum But we also need to think about optical setting uh, we need to think about Um ways in which advanced civilizations would communicate with each other right so Answer a is we haven't searched enough answer b Comes to that Would we really see them and One of my favorite answers to this is the dark forest uh, you know the the um If you read the three-body problem the that trilogy of books that uh Goes into contact with alien civilizations, etc. I highly recommend that trilogy um Oh I want to talk about it, but I don't want to spoil it for people. Don't spoil it. Yeah, I want to spoil it But uh it's just worth reading I agree. Yeah, uh, but but basically the point is that engine loom Ah correct you probably have the pronunciation much better than I uh close anyway, so um the basic point is like It's not always advantageous to broadcast your existence right and Uh, and so we kind of take it from around that of course if life's out there But want to talk to us Yeah, um, so that's my part a and part b answer to the family paradox good Well, we'll we'll get some data uh, once you get your spacecraft up there and uh maybe around 2030 We'll have you back on the podcast to talk about results from your lander Sooner than that for a lot of god. We know each other a long time. But listen like think about it um The year you just mentioned 2030 2035 2040 even How exciting is that Oh, it's very exciting this could be the century decades exactly so whether it's um dragonfly going to Titan clipper going to Europa hopefully a lander going to Europa Hopefully a mission that'll fly through the plumes of Enceladus Uh, exoplanets going gangbusters said he hopefully uh taking on uh broader and broader uh search and and and surveying those exoplanets Within the next few decades we could potentially answer this primordial age-old question of are we alone and that's You know, gonna revolutionize biology. It's gonna revolutionize how we think about our place in the universe Yeah, and uh, so for all of the the pains and agony of you know trying to operate on these timescales we do live in a And a beautiful time where we might transform the universe in which we live into a biological universe Can't think of a better any place than that kevin hand thanks so much for being on the podcast thanks Sean a lot of fun to see you and chat with you You
