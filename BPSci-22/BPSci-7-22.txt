Hello everyone and welcome to our study live. I'm Sarah Jennings with Frontier Development Lab. Frontier Development Lab is an applied artificial intelligence research accelerator and we bring folks from around the world in machine learning and space science and we pair them together to work on interesting challenges with NASA and our private sector partners. So we are in week six of FDL and I am here today with another one of our amazing FDL teams. This team is the solar wind team. Some of our previous study lives we've had a lot of conversation about the most interesting thing that they learned from FDL was actually that there is space weather and this is kind of an interesting new concept that they hadn't thought about. So really exciting to be talking with this team today. So I'm joined with Amanda Nathan, Mayvith Marcella and Seditiona. So thank you guys so much for coming today and to kick us off I'd really love to hear a little bit more about the challenge that you're working on and why it is important. So Amanda. Yeah absolutely. So first I think it's probably very important to understand what exactly solar wind is. So if you give me just a moment I want to share an animation with you. Let me know if you see it. I know it's sometimes I take the moment to load. I'm assuming silence meets it's visible. So I'll go ahead and start. So if you take a look at the animation you can see our solar system and you'll see our sun in the middle middle and every star has an extended atmosphere that radiates outwards into space and the atmosphere is made of charged particles or plasma that we call the solar wind. There are two types of solar wind fast and slow and of course based on the name you'll assume correctly that it's partially based on the velocity or speed of the solar wind but it's also based on its source. So for fast solar wind we have a pretty good understanding of the source and this fast solar wind travels upwards of 750 kilometers per second or almost 200 million miles an hour but slow solar wind which is actually the focus of our project isn't very well understood. And so because the earth is constantly bathed in slow solar wind even though we're largely protected by the earth's magnetosphere which is generated by the earth's magnetic field it can still interact or interfere with some of our assets in space such as communications GPS long-term space exploration and our astronauts such as the ones that are living on the international space station. So understanding the source and the structure of solar wind is very important and when I refer to the structure of solar wind I can get my slides to change there we go. We're taking kind of a zoomed-in look at the sun here the sun's in the middle and you can see the solar wind kind of radiating outwards hopefully you can see my mouse moving around and you can see that there is a lot of really nice structure here so a part of our project is to really understand these structures which will in turn help us understand kind of the source of the solar wind overall and that's our challenge in a nutshell really. I was a fabulous explanation really really wonderful and really drives home the importance of space weather and even if we don't really think about it how much it really does impact us and our entire solar system and beyond. So thank you very much for introducing the challenge. I would really like to know a little bit more about what you guys are working on as far as cataloging the work and why a catalog of this doesn't already exist so Nathan I'm hoping you can answer that question. Yeah thanks Ericka question so let me pull up my slide here. All right so I'll do a little pause here so hopefully it has time to show up on everyone else's screen. All right so as Amanda was just talking about there's lots of structure in the solar winds and not only is there lots of structure but there's lots of different types of structure that show up in the solar wind. We have things that span time scales that are on the order of days and these are called interplanetary coronal mass ejections and so these are some of the largest structures that show up in the solar wind and these are the ones that are sort of the most dangerous for humans you know up in lower orbit and can really affect not only satellites in lower orbit but also power systems down on the ground and you know these typically order in the number of tens to say 50s per year at Earth so Earth is located 1AU from the Sun so 1AU is just it's an astronomical unit and it's 93 million miles and it's sort of the average distance that the Earth is from the Sun throughout the course of the year and so these are you know an example of one type of structure but you can see here there's many more so we have small scale magnetic flux ropes that have time scales that span from minutes to hours and there's you know thousands of these that show up per year and we have even you know other small scale structures that are different that are called interplanetary magnetic field enhancements that span time scales from minutes to hours as well but occur less frequently throughout the year and then finally we have these magnetic discontinuities which are sort of the smallest structures that show up in the solar wind and there's just tons of these that show up every year and they're very difficult to go through and manually verify right so you imagine there's 10,000 of these that show up per year tens of thousands of them and there's you know many years worth of data and so what we want to do is build catalogues for these very hard and pesky objects and structures in the solar wind right so you can imagine for these large scale structures like interplanetary chrono mass ejections it's pretty easy to go look at you know some data and say okay yes you know this one this first one out of our list of 20 is an ICME let's go to the next one right you can you can envision somebody doing that but once things start to spin up to on the order of thousands it becomes very difficult and it's very labor intensive and it's very time consuming for researchers who want to understand what drives these structures from a first principal's physics standpoint and so what we would like to do is take artificial intelligence and apply it to the solar wind so that we can build these catalogues of these really small scale structures with minimal bias and by removing and minimizing the bias and structures hopefully we can provide these researchers with catalogues that are faithful representations of the objects that they should contain and it will allow people to really have a test bed for improving theories and furthering our understanding of the solar wind. Thanks Nathan that was a really good overview of the structures and the why you need this type of catalog I was wondering if I could get a little bit more of an explanation about the data that you guys are using and where it comes from. Solution. Solution are you able to share a little bit more about the data? Yes absolutely absolutely Sarah I'll put up my screen here so we are looking at data from two different instruments two different space props and some of you might or probably all of you know that there are multiple different space props that are actually monitoring and observing the sun as we speak and we are going to focus on just two of them and the first one that we are interested in is the Parker solar probe which is an instrument that was launched in 2018 it's one of the newest instrument newest space props that was launched and we had data from around three years work of data another instrument that we're also interested in is actually the wind data which was launched in 1994 and we have at least 22 25 years work of data and we are going to focus on only 15 years work of data and there's a reason why we are actually monitoring these two instruments why we are using data from these two specific instruments as Amanda mentioned that the solar wind is radiating outwards and as it is doing so you can imagine that there are different structures in the solar wind so whatever structure we have closer to the sun is probably not going to be very similar to the ones that we have near earth so if we have instruments at different locations on the solar system we should be able to get a very good understanding of what's happening with this wind of the sun so I'm just about to show you and the orbit of PSP or Parker solar probe so it's a very unique instrument because this spacecraft is orbiting the sun and at some stage it's going to go type straight into it and what you see here are the spirals showing the orbit of the Parker solar probe and the green dot if you can see it if my cursor is pointing and you can see there this is exactly where Parker solar probe was today at 1800 UTC so this is where the instrument is right now and the green orbit show the orbit set the PSP has already made and the red one show where it will be in the future and as you can see as it's moving from the earth towards the sun it's covering a very large distance one AU more or less and that means that we'll be able to understand what's happening to the solar wind as it's moving and as it's moving radially outwards and just to give some context here about wind wind is situated here wind is actually very close to earth so as you can see by comparing the data from these three different instruments we'll be obtaining a wealth of information about the wind the solar wind and just to give you a glimpse of what kind of data actually we're looking at we're looking at the magnetic field data specifically and this is what we would call a time series of magnetic field over time it shows how the magnetic field of the wind is varying with time and at the bottom you also see the velocity as well and as Amanda pointed out that the fast and the slow wind is differentiated based on the velocity and what we're seeing here is more or less the slow wind velocity so these are the instruments that we are investigating and this kind of data is what we are playing around with at the moment awesome thank you so much for that overview so now I feel like we've got a really good idea of both the challenge the cataloging the data that you guys are using and so in a second we'll dive in more on the techniques that you're using but just wanted to do a quick shout out first to our audience members that are coming in from all over the world it looks like we've got Louisiana, Greece, London, Brazil, Indiana, Colorado, Ireland, the UK, Virginia so thank you all for joining us today and if you do have any questions we already see some questions coming in please send them to us and we will have a little bit of time at the end for some audience questions so with that let's shift back and if you can describe a little bit about the techniques that you're using for this particular challenge and so I'll pass it over to Marcelo oh thank you Sarah so mainly we are providing artificial intelligence techniques so it means that we teach the computer how to process and analyze all the data we have so we take advantage of all this power of this computer tools instead of doing it manually by Canadian set so then we can save lots of efforts and also save time and and we don't need too much expertise because we are teaching the computer to do this for us and given this fact that I will share my screen just to show such tools and example of a tool that we are using so I okay now you can see my screen so here like Sudezha told you we are now analyze the magnetic field from the solar wind so our data set is a huge amount of data that have been collected from from both instruments and this figure on the left side you can see only five minutes so then you can imagine how much data we have since we have been captured over years and then what we can do with this data is using the computer and such tools to convert to transform this data into images for instance and then the computer is able to learn from this image and then to classify this images trying to find some events and some objects using the solar wind that can really impact the weather on Earth so basically we take advantage of the classification created by the computer itself because we teach the computer and the computer learns how to do that and then we don't need to do it manually so we can say the most of efforts and then we can use it as a classification for instance in this case. Great thank you so much that was a great overview and now I think it's one of the most exciting parts I would really like to know what initial results your team has were in week six so you still have a couple weeks left but I would love to share with the audience anything that you guys are able to to share. I go ahead and present for iSax and then where select can take a little select. Okay cool so I'm going to go ahead and share my screen. So can you see this? Oh good awesome okay so here's some results that we just got this are actually last week so what you're looking at here are the same magnetic curves that we have been talking about last year I showed earlier from PSP and the wind spacecraft and so what we're essentially doing here is we're trying to identify solar structures in the solar wind magnetic field so if you're to look in this area on this plot on the right hand side you can see that there's these straight lines of the magnetic field and these are the kinds of structures that Nathan was talking about earlier that we're searching for and that we want to catalog for the helio physics community so here if you look at our legend you can see that there's different timestamps, different daytime stamps so essentially what we're doing is we're grouping together all these similar structures and our entire data set so we have like 315,000 plus measurements from past 3 years from the PSP and by being able to group together these two my structures we can actually be able to get a better idea of just how solar wind evolves throughout time and back to the plot on the left you can see that essentially what we've done is for all these magnetic curves on the right hand side we've compressed them so basically we're taking all the very important details that we want we want to we don't want to look at the noise or any trends that are characteristic of solar winds we just want you know just the meat so what we've done is we've taken that meat of all the magnetic curves we have brought them together as far algorithm does it brings together the solar features and then finally allows us to sort them into these different groups that we can then categorize and save for later analysis and now pass it back to our cell if who's going to talk about our other method so and in our other methods like I mentioned and I produced mention it before we not only do the declusterings so we don't just group all the similarities that we have from our data but also we try to classify so we take the wind data that we have a storage and then basically what we do is to try to find some in a new data that we are receiving we try to find some new information that is it will tell us if we have an even that is happening in the solar wind or not so the computer can do this for us and then can classify an event that is occurring and in the other side because PSP is a very new instrument and we just have data for things 2018 we don't have a label data so it means that we don't know in exactly parts of the time we have some events or objects and then what we can do is just to group the similarities that we have so basically we just chunk the time series the time that we have and then we just cluster them all these these are on the similarities that we have so this is our the both techniques that we are applying and they are called as supervisate and unsupervised learning because when we know the data and the label and and the other we don't know we just can do what we just can do is just to cluster them all and just just to try to see if we can find some similarities and then we can play with this and then after we can create our catalog and then this catalog we can just present it to the specialists to the physics and then they will tell us okay this is really important because now we can classify our events and then our objects that we have and the solar infrastructures and then this is basically what we need to understand the weather the impact on the weather that we have here on earth so this is why this is important to us to do this kind of to understand the behavior of the solar system. Thank you so much and thanks for sharing some of the initial results and I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys are able to show us at the showcase and beyond so really exciting work and now I'd like to shift gears a little bit and ask all of you a couple of questions before we take some from the audience we also have some other viewers tuning in we have Bulgaria and Iceland and Florida and Michigan so welcome for joining us so the next question is why are you specifically interested in this challenge and so I'm just going to call on each of you to kind of share what brought you here why you're interested in the work that you're doing this summer so we'll start with Amanda. Yeah thanks so I don't think it was mentioned before but frontier development lab projects up until this summer usually were comprised of like postdocs and and folks in industry working on these problems and myself and Davis are actually the very first undergraduate students to work in this program and so for me specifically research really didn't feel like a viable option for me and a lot of that you know is rooted in a lot of self-doubt and imposter syndrome but everything for me about space is interesting so it was hard with little direction or opportunity to narrow down a focus and so when I got a call from our team lead who's not here today I really just had to take a leap of faith not only in the team that I was going to be a part of but in myself knowing that I would be able to learn and be a contributing member to the team and I really feel like I have in fact as a result of this opportunity I will have another opportunity to continue doing research with my university for another fellowship which I'm really excited about so the process of participating in research and growing both technically and personally has really been a life changing opportunity for me and as far as this particular challenge kind of just understanding the universe in which we live is fascinating slow solar wind as we understand today may not have a huge impact on our way alive but of course just kind of like understanding whether as a full even when you know it's beautiful and sunny is really just going to help us kind of exist in the world that we live in and and that's what really interests me about this challenge. So thank you so much for sharing Amanda and we're really excited that you're here this the summer so thank you and Nathan we'll go to you next. Oh man how do I follow up that answer that was phenomenal so jealous. No so for me this is the exact sort of stuff that I've you know always wanted to do but never really knew existed for space physics and so when I you know discovered the frontier development lab and was like I had read the project description it sounded like I had written it how like how closely it was aligned with what I wanted to do and it was like my first experience of anything FDL and so like it's just it's so applicable for everything that I will be doing throughout my career so I'm a first year PhD student and by developing these tools I really think we're going to help accelerate science and extracting meaning from the solar wind and so that is what I'm really interested in. Awesome creating answer Nathan thank you so much and we'll go next down the line to Sedizuna. Okay so yeah so I'm so I'm a postdoc and I'm actually studying stars which are very similar to our Sun so I'm interested in learning how the postdoc impacts the atmosphere and a planet basically so now we have so many exoplanets detected but the next step the next step for us would be to understand whether any of these exoplanets are habitable so what I study is how does the Sun or how does the star impact the habitability of these exoplanets and although I started off my PhD doing data analysis and doing some little bit of modeling and whatnot and last year I got really got into machine learning and AI so for me I felt like okay if we want to know about anything about exoplanets then we need to first understand our own planet we need to understand about our own Earth we need to understand about our own Sun and our when it comes to solar physics there's so much of data that's out there it's we you're basically drowning with information and machine learning and AI is one of the very best ways of actually applying these techniques and then getting something out of it so this is a perfect combination of AI science and I feel like I'm in the sweet spot and I'm really enjoying my time with all these wonderful people working to working together yeah that's awesome thank you and definitely in the right spot and I will next go to Mavis yeah so similarly to Amanda just you know you're an undergraduate and you hear about this program that's comprised of basically just postdocs and graduate students you think to yourself oh well how am I supposed to but we'll be able to contribute to this but something that our team laid and all of our teammates have really emphasized was like the value of learning and growing up I really have always enjoyed learning but during the summer I've come to learn things more about machine learning that I didn't know about before and I have to say I haven't always been very confident about coding I have a very bad history with coding um but yeah back in high school you know it seems simple than entering college you certainly learn about all these other different kinds of data structures and you realize oh wow there's a lot more to programming than I thought prior but throughout this summer we've really been taking advantage of like the object oriented aspect of Python and classes and also just different machine learning mechanisms like clustering and I remember at the beginning of the program I was just consulting a bunch of my professors from my college asking hey what's what does this method do what is this kind of program big in machine learning I have absolutely no idea what this is and I was surprised to learn that a lot of them actually weren't too familiar with the methods that we were using and that's because in FTL what we're doing is we're basically creating new infrastructure for programming like everything is literally like taking from scratch these are things that people have not yet explored and that's why FTL has taken on these challenges and I think that's one of the things that really did us try to make that FTL just the fact that we're doing new research that people have not yet touched and we're seeing we're seeing this for the first time like we're the ones first laying our eyes on this is like finding that treasure you know but aside from that I go to a college that's just undergraduate so they don't work we still get to do research with their props but we don't work with graduate students or postdocs so I've been told my professors from other universities like hey you're missing out you don't really you know you're not interacting with the cool kids so now I get to say hey but you know what I did interact with the cool kids I got to spend one very awesome summer with a bunch of very cool kids thank you very much yeah that's my story that's awesome thank you mavis and yeah truly like we do work on the cutting edge stuff we're able to work on new research that hasn't been done before so that's a really exciting piece of what we get to do at FTL so thank you and now we'll go to Marcella thank you Sara well I think this is because I basically always wanted it to be an astronaut so this is this is as close as I can be of it so for me FTL is a great opportunity to learn about the space and I am really passionate about it so this is really exciting because and now I can really contribute somehow to the science and also I can share the technology now I can also learn from the other people and from other areas so this is really something this is something really new for me because I am learning a lot and then this is why I think it's very important because each one can contribute and then well since I have been giving classes of artificial intelligence I have never seen things like this before because everyone can help each other and then this is why FTL is really important for me and this is why I am here so basically to learn and to know all I can I can do about space in this kind of place that's awesome thank you and now I'm just curious on this call can you raise your hand if you are also interested in becoming an astronaut cool a few people sounds good seems good I'm personally more interested in mission control but I'm really excited that you guys are interested in becoming astronauts and the work that we're doing is really beneficial to humanity on the whole so thank you all and now I'd also like to ask you guys another question we've learned a lot during FTL so I want to know what the most interesting thing that you have learned over the past six weeks is so I'm going to go to different order this time and I'm going to kick off with Sugizuna oh where should I start so this I have to say I knew that coming into FTL there were loads of things that I wouldn't know and there are loads of things that I would learn as Marcella said which is happening but I think one thing that I probably didn't really think about and I found it very fascinating was that you think okay I have worked on these kind of topics before so you know I have quoted before and whatnot so I know that this probably won't work and this is probably the right way of doing things and not not and you have your own mindset and you go into it and then you are working with a team and then someone says have you thought about it this way and it's like oh my god how am I so stupid I have never thought about this before so it's so fun to actually explore these things together that you would never ever think of it but then someone just points out and someone says oh let's do this one that's it's so much fun so I was a bit stressed when I first started FTL thinking oh my god I have to share codes with other people and I have and I'm a terrible I'm not very good at programming I'm have a terrible coder so I don't want to share my screen with other people but during this whole experience you learn so much about yourself as well and like and it's such a good learning experience so every single day is fun so yeah it's great I'm really enjoying myself probably a bit too much so yeah I don't think you can enjoy yourself too much during the FTL program it's super good to hear and yeah it's amazing to have so many different perspectives to be tackling a particular problem so it's awesome and we'll go to next and Ethan yeah this is this is so tough I feel like I've learned so many just like interesting things and it again all comes down to having you know a bunch of people in a room that all come from different backgrounds that all have different expertise and I think the thing that really sort of like blew me away is learning about all the different ways that people are manipulating time series data to put it into a different structure that is like compatible with with machine learning so for example turning regular time series data into an image I didn't even know that was a thing until I came to FTL and so like I saw that and I like made the first image and I was like oh my god this is crazy like you can actually do this and then you just start feeding those into a computer and then it like learns from that image what the time series is and it's just very everything is very fascinating so it's hard to like really single out one interesting thing but if I had to I think it would be just manipulating time series into like different representations that's definitely a great one thank you Nathan and we'll go to Mavis next I guess there's two different things I've learned for the first thing quite similarly to Nathan just being able to manipulate time series data so for the method I was showing earlier that's called iSax and hardly anyone knows about iSax iSax is just this completely alien thing that we spent like nearly an entire week trying to figure out because there was like there were no open resources online except for maybe one source and it was in French so we had to Google translate the page it was honestly looking back on it it was kind of hilarious but just realizing how computers really are they're really highly powered like we know that they're highly powered but once you start machine learning you realize true power of computers like being able to impress data and take all these complex details somehow simplify them and still be able to group together similar structures like how does it do that and so there's a lot of math and both too and just I feel this program has really motivated me to take more math classes so as a physics major I am completely done with all of my math prerequisites but I would love to take more math classes because of this and secondly I say that this program has definitely reshaped my perspective of just working with like postdocs like in academia is so forth because I didn't have the best experience myself when I first did research a couple summers ago the talk the environment was kind of toxic and there is just all this hype about like Ivy leagues and like you know just not really there was no value placed on practical work it was more so how complicated is this work can you explain it and can you understand it if you can then that means that you're you know like you're like a big boss or something and so then I felt very pressured in that environment to perform like much harder than my own expectations and I found myself always dressing out and coming here to FDL just everyone is very understanding that everyone's actually patient and they take this time to explain things to you and when you're confused you know they don't look down on you they say hey I've been in that spot before like I've been in undergrad before I started at an industry before I know how you feel and I am going to help you out because you don't have to feel that way that's why we're here and so I'm trying to learn that yeah you know but I'm not supposed to fear my coworkers like anyone else is higher in academia like they can be mentors and mentors do exist yeah it's great thank you so much Meevis and next we'll go to Marcella well I think the most special thing I have learned from FDL is how to work in our group so basically because first we really knows what is what is the the reason that we are here because we shared our knowledge and then we can open our minds so we are pushed by themselves inside the group to open it and this is really amazing and exciting because now we really understand that we can do it and we can do it more because we are together not because we are giving the best of of ourselves because we are giving the best of our entire team and then we have pushed to to only a specific goal but the goal is not to deliver something or just to be fast but learning this is the amazing part of FDL and this is what I have been learning that the most important is that everyone here has to be on the same page everyone here has to learn at the same level because we are the team and the other thing that I have learned is about our voices so our thing near he always say that our voices has too much power and when we say about it when we share about what we are thinking this is absolutely exciting and amazing for each one of us because then we can explicitly say what we are thinking and we don't need to worry about what the others will think because we are a team so we are very comfortable to do that besides all the machine learning involved of course. Yeah that's a great response and we definitely believe that research the research that we do is a team of sports so that is a great explanation of that in practice so thank you and we'll go to Amanda. Yeah so um more along the technical side pretty much everything I've learned is fascinating because I came into this program with pretty much zero knowledge of everything that we're covering everything about the sun that we've been talking about everything with coding and machine learning I have like a little bit of coding experience before I started but really not at the level now just after like six to eight weeks which has been really really great and I hope that I hope that it shows just how much I've been able to learn I hope I was it's not like I was speaking with some level of competency when I opened everything up but that was just what I what I've learned over the course of the summer again I had I had no background on any of that before I started but the other thing that's been really eye opening to me to piggyback off of Mavis's second point is really just the interaction that I've had with everybody on this team and even in the FDL as a whole everyone who's a postdoc or in grad school um I think being also a first generation college student I didn't have access to the people like that and I think I for a long time held a stereotype in my head of people who hold PhDs kind of on a pedestal inaccessible kind of like that that that experience that Mavis was talking about and interacting with the people through the FDL we've been able to kind of create a space in which we're all vulnerable which we all have our own insecurities and of course with the the guidance of our team leaves and obviously the amazing attitudes of everyone on the team we've created a space where we're really comfortable with this and we're all growing and we're all learning even though we're all at really different levels in our education and in our careers and so these interactions have made me feel like research or even a like a graduate school education is possible for me and if I may I actually first went to college over 10 years ago and basically flunked out of aerospace engineering and now like I'm back interacting with all of these amazing people about to to graduate with a degree in engineering and even going to grad school and I think without these experiences without talking to people and kind of feeling like that that experience is possible for me I might you know have never done it so I hope anyone watching who might be in a similar experience that might feel like this kind of research isn't accessible or maybe you don't have what it takes I encourage you to kind of take a leap of faith and kind of pursue the things that are really interesting to you it might take 10 years to have for the fact to do it but you can do it anytime it doesn't matter how old you are so yeah sorry that's really long and probably more deep than you were expecting but I think that's definitely my biggest takeaway from from this program for sure I don't know that's really really great and very inspiring thank you so much Amanda and I think we are coming up to our time and I know you guys are very busy in week six so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys go and just wanted to say thank you again to our solar wind team you guys have done an amazing job and I am really looking forward to seeing the work that you guys do in the coming weeks thank you to our audience we'll be back again with some more um study lives with the FDL teams so appreciate everybody taking the time and just wanted to say thank you take care
