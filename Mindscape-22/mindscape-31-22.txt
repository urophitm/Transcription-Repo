 Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and if you're familiar with my book, The Big Picture or any of the various talks that given on that book, you'll know that one of my favorite factoids is that the average human lifespan is 3 billion heartbeats. That's not a very profound fact if you just take the fact that the average human being lives for about 75 years and do your dimensional analysis to convert from years to heartbeats. The number works out to be about 3 billion for a typical human being stretching from birth to death. But it's an interesting fact because it brings home in a slightly more vivid way how short our life is. 3 billion is a big number but it's not unimaginably big and unlike years, heartbeats are going by all the time. You've squandered several of your heartbeats already, listening to me talk right here. I've learned this fact about the 3 billion heartbeats from today's guest Dr. Jeffrey West who's a distinguished professor at the Santa Fe Institute. It's the context of a much more profound fact about biological organisms here on Earth. If you take any particular kind of organism, let's say mammals, human beings or mammals, they come in all shapes and sizes. There's tiny little mice, there's big old blue whales or elephants, but there are relationships between the size of an animal, in mass for example, the number of kilograms the thing has, and other biological facts such as how long it lives. Bigger animals, whales and elephants live for much longer than tinier things like mice or squirrels. Meanwhile, there's another relationship between your size and your heart rate. Big animals like whales and elephants have very slow heartbeats, tiny animals have very rapid heartbeats, and you can see where this is going. These two facts exactly cancel out. The average number of heartbeats for mammals is approximately the same for tiny little mice or big blue whales or elephants. It's not an exact relationship. In fact, the number for a typical mammal works out not to be 3 billion but 1.5 billion, which maybe you could argue is roughly what we had, we human beings, back in the state of nature before we had pasteurized milk and Obamacare and things like that. But the point is that something is going on that goes beyond mere biology. There's some reason why there's a relationship between how fast your heart beats, how massive you are, and how long you live. That's what got today's guest, Jeffrey West, interested in biology, networks, and complex systems. He started his academic life as a particle physicist, but he read about these scaling relations and he realized from his physics point of view, no one understood them. No one knew why things were like that. So he and his collaborators developed a theory that explains why you get this relationship as an animal gets bigger, it lives longer, but its heart slows down. The pace of life is slower for larger animals. These days he's extending that analysis not just to individual animals, but to cities or cultures or other kinds of networks that fill our daily lives today. This kind of analysis is absolutely crucial for sustainability, for thinking about how we live in the world, for choosing how to manage our life here on Earth. Jeffrey West is the former president of the Santa Fe Institute and he's the author of a wonderful recent book called Scale, the Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the pace of life in organisms, cities, economies, and companies. It's not the most elegant title, I'll give you that, but it's an extremely important and hopefully influential book that helps us understand the world we live in. So let's go.

Nice to be here. Thanks for inviting me. So I have to ask when you're on an airplane going to a conference traveling around the world and you find yourself sitting next to an inquisitive type and they say, so what do you do for a living? What is your answer to that kind of question? Oh goodness me. That's a tough one and it always stops me in my tracks. But a because I'm slightly mis-thropic. But what do I say? I think I always lead off pretty much by saying I'm a physicist. And then I quickly say I'm a physicist but I work now a lot in questions, challenges that are considered outside of usual physics. And I've done quite a lot of work in what I would consider fundamental questions in biology and now about cities, companies and I'm particularly interested in the whole question of global sustainability. So I sort of do it in that maybe not quite as linearly as that but effectively. But now in your youth you're more or less mainstream theoretical. Absolutely. Absolutely. So what kinds of things did you work on then and what happened? So, yes. So most of my career, meaning the first 30 odd years, I did definitely what you would call mainstream particle physics. Even entering it when I would say the kinds of things you work on and you've made your name on what considered way out. You know, there weren't questions a real physicist should be answering. That's my ideology, don't you? Yeah, yeah, that was like, come on. And I think one of the, by the way, just tangentially one of the great things that has happened in physics is that we do ask those questions and we address them seriously and it's now developed into its own thing and it's profound influence. Back then I was mainstream physicist working on, well I entered it very fortunately at a really opportune moment because these famous experiments which got the Nobel Prize at Stanford on which eventually we interpreted as discovering quarks were taking place. The results were just coming out and I had been sort of the early 70s. Well, they were the late 60s actually in late 60s. I got my PhD in 66 and those the accelerator at Stanford was just being completed and the first experiments were being performed and the results that changed everything which were results on an experiment at the time was thought of as an example. The time was thought of as mundane and uninteresting appeared and they were quite surprising and as I say eventually they were interpreted as the evidence for quarks and that was a very exciting period is one tried to interpret those experiments try to formulate models and then theories and ultimately the evolution towards something called quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the theory. So the theory of the strong interactions and that was very exciting. Did you feel that this is what life was going to be like every few years you would discover a new layer of structure of matter and new fundamental law? Absolutely, no, in fact I would say during that period from probably 68-70 onwards through the 70s and into the early 80s we were kind of spoiled because every year there was a new, fantastic discovery that either or confirmation of something and it was just a marvelous period and it culminated in the development of the so-called standard model where we see some sort of grand unification or at least we saw that you could contemplate grand unification of the electromagnetism with the kind of strong forces and so on and that was just immensely exciting and then that led to this naivete that it would only be a few more years when we can get gravity into the picture. And so as I say but it was a period of immense excitement but a period of being spoiled as one does you know I mean it reminds me a bit it actually is sort of interesting when I look back on it because it also had some of the flavor of the 60s and 70s in society. You know the emergence from the 50s and early 60s and kind of the image of suburban America with 2.4 children and that image of every but we all had to suddenly the psychedelic revolution the vietnam war and what the demonstrations and anti war movement brought civil rights movement so the we hit the Reagan era and then we hit exactly and so it is that in physics we hit. Not because of a Ronald Reagan or because there was a vote but because it turns out that nature was not quite as forthcoming as we thought or we weren't smart enough despite you know I think what I do think was an even I've been quite critical of it I think an extraordinary development and that is a string theory. Right I mean it was a marvelous leap but you did mention discoveries and or confirmations and there was a shift so after the mid to late 70s there weren't a lot of more surprises coming our way we were confirming things that we had models that explained and indeed it's sort of the dirty little secret of particle physics there haven't been any. Exactly exactly there's been nothing that is sort of you know in fact the big things as you know better than I you know gravitational waves of the higgs particle and so on are confirmations of things that in one case were predicted you know I know whatever 70 years ago whatever or longer actually and then in the other 30 40 years ago whatever it's been. But a long time but I mean very exciting that we have confirmed those but also especially in the case of the higgs it's it you know in really in some ways it's like the end of something that's rather than I mean gravitational waves I think you could see it is the end of something in a certain way we don't but it's also the beginning of some. It's not a me it's certainly exactly and that's the thing it's now even so that we can use it as a tool again and so where's the higgs is sort of putting a full stop a period at the end of something it's now done and the big questions that have been there since the mid to late 70s remain a how does gravity fit and but even within grand unified were left with all these parameters and you know where do they come from. We're unified in a certain sense but in the sense that a physicist would like ultimately we're still a long way away no one thinks it's the right final theory of everything what we have right now but it's compatible with all the data and this presumably played a role in your choice to become a less mainstream physicist. Yes well it did in the following sense that you know it was it was frustrating as time went on but also you know we suddenly developed this idea putting all our eggs into the superconducting super collide of basket and with the idea that with this longer reach of energy it would reveal something exciting you it would in fact confirm the hegs of course. But it was to be sort of the United States's version of the large Hadron collider exactly but bigger and better and maybe even sooner had all come to be absolutely and in fact I mean one of the great iron is again maybe used by dirty little secret this is also a sort of dirty little secret I think is that in the days in which people were promoting the SSC you know to get the money for it and just to drum up the general interest. Of course the certain the Europeans have responded by saying we're going to make this large Hadron collider which would be you know almost an order magnitude less in energy and the dirty little secret was that the US physics community continually bad mouth the galaxy I mean it was like always useless there's no reason to believe whatsoever they can discover anything the reach just isn't. Far enough you've certainly got to go to you know what it was 12 15 or even ultimately 20 TV and the dirty little secret is in the context of now that the LHC is the only game in town and we are involved in it and it discovered the hegs all we can do is talk how fantastic it is what a great idea you know and you know it's it's so physicists are also prone to you know emotions and politics and all that. They're human beings they're human beings so I don't I'm not you know not blaming anyone but it is it's but we sometimes certainly in those days I would say I think the physics the Heinz you physics community was of course very arrogant because it felt it was doing the most fundamental and therefore the most important science on the planet. But also that we were immune from the human foibles such as this and I think both of those things have been. Damage and destroy rightfully I think I think we were overly arrogant overly self involved self centered the it ended with you know the calling string theory the theory of everything which already connotes a certain attitude towards everything else right so. You know and I think that's been in a certain sense that's been healthy for the field actually to be honest. So that that that that meaning the that this extraordinary intellectual narcissism coupled with arrogance which I think might have served us well for quite a long while in the you know not saying that it was necessary but not questioning yourself does motivate you to do. Yes it does and especially when you think you're doing the you know the most exciting fundamental physics that has universal applicability and is you know the meaning of life kind of yeah that's right and that's very exciting and that was you know mostly unsaid part of the culture.

canceled by congress in the 1990s so that affected your that's affected me and as it did yes so I am it it affected me of this reasons but it also because the I was at Los Alamos at the time and we had some significant involvement in building one of the detectives with in fact led by Barry Barish my Caltech your Caltech colleague you were of course of the Nobel Prize for the LIGO experiment but we were heavily involved in that and I was a theorist I wasn't directly haven't involved but that was part of our program but also I go off on a slight tangent here there was another phenomenon so I was in my 50s at the time and I come from a line of short live males you know my father died in 61 my grandfather at 57 and so on back I mean we're all none of us the male line doesn't live very long it turns out and for different reasons by the way which is interesting of itself but so the reason I say that is because I grew up with the idea that it was exceedingly unlikely or rather you expect to die at about age 60 and here I was you know I don't know what it was 53 54 maybe and I realized my God we've had the death of the SSC I'm 54 55 whatever it was at the time and my God I probably only have five years maybe I'm stretching ten years and wow that's you know one one I should start thinking about what I'm going to do when I grow up kind of thing and you know now the SSC is gone this is has a big psychological effect but another thing was happening the death of the SSC was driven by to some extent by a big anti-science movement in the US which comes up every once in a while but in particular it was an antifysics one and even more particular it was an anti-high energy physics one so that it was a very peculiar situation that even our colleagues in other parts of physics were not supportive and in fact they had this mistaken idea that if they killed the SSC they would all be rich kind of image which turned out to be completely untrue to be fair the SSC would have been very expensive of course and had all that money gone to the rest of physics they would have been rich but it never happened it never would happen it was a humongous amount of money on the scale of a science experiment no question and you know there were there were obviously questions about its viability what it would actually do and so on you know all kinds of good good questions but nevertheless okay there was this anti particular anti-high energy physics but one of the things I used to hear both at Los Alamos which after all is a national lab with huge numbers of activities going from the weapons program all the way through to the multiple areas of the physical sciences but I also heard it in the halls of the Department of Energy which was the funding agency for the SSC was this famous statement physics was the science of the 19th and 20th centuries biology is the science of the 21st century and the corollary which was usually not said but I did hear it saying I said was therefore no need to do any more fundamental physics we know all the physics we need to know that was very explicitly very expert and that was you know that really threw me and so I reacted emotionally to the idea that well first of all on on reflection it was obvious biology was going to be a major science of the 21st century no one could doubt that was clear it was poised for that and if your question had been do we know all the fundamental particle physics we need to do biology and chemistry then the answer is yes yes other kinds of physics absolutely no so I have your grand unification will have no impact no impact so this is one of the we could we should discuss that because I think that's it remains an issue you know why are we doing things that have in any way that we can immediately conceive anyway any foreseeable influence on betterment of human life on the planet making America great again or whatever in fact work I'd like very much like to get a chance to do that but I'm a long more personal lines I was I reacted a to the idea that that's nonsense you know that's really crazy that you've got to support all the physics and you've got to have people think about fundamental questions if we are to address fundamental questions in biology you know that's sort of part of the culture and I'm going to do that and more specifically I reacted by saying that you know if biology were real science it would be you know you'd have equations and principles and you'd be able to magnetize things I mean all very well you know we all know the principle of natural selection Darwin's contribution was fantastic but you know except in a limited way it doesn't predict the kinds of things we in physics would think you would need to predict if it were a complete theory you would want a curve that you could fit data to exactly you're prediction exactly and I used to say very you know very sarcastically you know if you had a real theory then you could predict that there should be human beings I mean which is taking to an extreme but so I would push back with that at various meetings you know and discussions and then I started to think you know my god maybe I should take that seriously you know that biology really you know does need what I would say is biology needs not just the techniques that physics uses the mathematical techniques but equally and possibly even more important it needs to integrate in a way of thinking a certain culture which I and and I must tell you this was out of this arrogance of the Heinzschild physicist and also out of ignorance of biology so it was really emotionally you know I mean a perfect storm real perfect storm for disaster but then I started thinking about it and I combined these two things the fact that maybe I was going to die soon the SSC is dead and they're telling us that physics should be dead the kind of physics I have an experience of the science about and we should all be doing biology and I thought about that and I thought you know I wonder if if biology were a science like physics there ought to be in a biology book a calculation of why it is that my lifespan even though I'm running a lift to 60 or 65 I thought at that time even conceivably I wouldn't lift to 100 100 years come from right you know so I started reading biology books so you're worried not about why 60 but why not a second or a millennium yes so where does this scale where does the overall scale that's the physicist way of thinking not just the mechanism what is the mechanism that's leading through aging to mortality but where what sets the scale of aging of lifespan of the 100 years so I started reading and I went to the libraries and I had a great time studying the literature because it was easy to read because it turned out to my amazement that the question of mortality and even aging is it was then a complete backwater really relative to most of the other things which you think about and you can and a metric of that is the following I started looking at these big fat biology textbooks that they use an undergraduate biology classes they cover all of biology and you know they were very useful by the way in my own education just obviously learning things that I had not been educated about but I'd look in those and I quickly discovered I must have at least half a dozen maybe more and I discovered sure there's a chapter on metabolism a chapter on growth there's a chapter on reproduction on genes on even ecology and so on nothing on mortality or aging you could look in the index you most of them wouldn't even mention it and I thought this is extraordinary you know when you think about it it's the second most important event in the in you know in an organism's life it's birth and death and there's nothing about death and I was absolutely shocked at that and then I discovered as I say reading that and it was fairly easy to read the literature because there was not much technical stuff having been done it was stuff that you know you only had to know sort of freshman biology to be able to follow it and there was nothing quantitative almost nothing I mean there were survival curves and so on but I remember we I invited a biologist Bonnie Bastler to give a colloquium in the Caltech physics department and she talked about bacteria and quorum sensing and the students were blown away because you know they were pounding the our graduate students in physics were pounding their heads against these problems that they really needed to work hard just to ask a question that we didn't know the answer to an in biology like you don't know the answer to half a dozen questions that you think up over the afternoon right sure exactly so it was quite different so anyway I started in the evening so to speak or when I was stuck on my physics I was doing which was very easy to be stuck on because I was still doing strings theory or being slightly depressed about the SSC I would work on this problem I'd think about it and I read as I read a lot of the literature and I started thinking about it and that got me and one of the things I quickly discovered in the literature were these remarkable scaling laws and because in looking at the literature for longevity I learned that there was an approximate scaling law for longevity as a function of size the function of the mass of an organism and it was a relatively simple one even though there was a lot of variation in the day a lot of fluct noise in the data sure of course but how should we think about what a scaling law is yes so let's talk about that because I want to that that's a good point of departure so a scaling law I mean in its most simple form is you know you take any system and you ask what happens if I increase all of its lengths by a certain parameter double its size triplet size what happens so the simplest obviously is if you take a rectangle and you double the size of each side the area doesn't double it goes up by a factor of two times two four so that's very trivial the volume of a similar object goes up by a factor of eight two times two times two so that's the simplest form of scaling scaling law it's one in one case a square in the other case a cube so so generalizing that one can then ask about let's just go to immediately to biology if I measure some characteristic of an organism and it could be something as fundamental which is what I want to get into as metabolic rate how much energy how much food if you like does it need each day to stay alive how did the 2000 food calories roughly speaking that we need how does that scale from the smallest mammal this is just a mammal so the smallest mammal to the blue whale how does it you know is there is there some regularity so that was the thing that I also learned about that these scaling laws and in particular the scaling law for metabolic rate had already been discovered people had collected well a man named Max Kiber originally had collected this in the 30s and discovered an extraordinary regularity that it was incredibly simple scaling law which we call a power law which I'll say it in English and then I'll say I'll translate it so the scaling law is as a function of mass it goes to the three quarters power of its mass which means what goes as the three I'm sorry the metabolic rate the metabolic rate how much your heart rate well the metronome just just the how much food you need each day let's stay with that first that that scales with the three quarters power of mass that's the way you say mathematically three quarters power of mass means that you cube the mass that's the three and the quarter means you take the square root twice so it's a very bizarre law from that viewpoint and well at least it's saying that bigger things need more food yes but less program less program and systematically so that so the thing that surprised me was that it was so simple mathematically simple and also that there was a law anyway that any law should exist because we have this notion that natural selection invokes the idea of random processes within an environment so and that any characteristic of an organism whatever it is including the organism itself but also it's the nature of itself the nature of its genes have a unique historical history I mean they historically contingent it depends on what's happened in the past and I mean so I'll just love to show us the diversity absolutely so that's that big thing that's Darwin that's their big thing and that's why they often argue physics and mathematics has actually nothing to do with biology because there aren't any simple things like that and here was a law about maybe the most fundamental quantity of biology how much food you need to stay alive and it was showing extreme regularity and whereas as I say from a naive natural selection viewpoint you would have expected if you plot it on a graph metabolic rate on the vertical axis versus size on the horizontal axis the points would be sort of all over the graph reflecting the historical contingency of an evolutionary history of each organism with a spark cash plus card from capital one you earn unlimited 2% cashback on every purchase plus no preset spinning limit helps your purchasing power adapt to meet your business needs Jorge

wallet find out more at capital 1 dot com slash spark cash plus terms conditions apply yeah why shouldn't two mammals of the same body mass have very different metabolism because they had different mechanisms that evolution exactly so this was pretty amazing to me but what was even more amazing was that if you looked at any physiological characteristic that could be measured or any life history events such as how long you live how long you take the mature the rate of which you grow with all these kinds of things they also had a very similar very simple regular behavior and in as I say just ever for size again in marked contrast to the naivete that we have about natural selection at furthermore and this was critical from a physicist viewpoint the the what we caught the exponent the three quarters in metabolic rate was repeated across all of these different characteristics so for totally different quantities for different quantities like questions some was mundane if you like his heart rate some as you know as profound really as lifespan we talked about earlier but you know things like you know the length of the your aorta something like that you know or the number of leaves on a tree as a function but so I learnt and I was very fortunate at the time that a few years earlier four books had come out pretty much the same time summarizing all of this so there must be anywhere from 50 to 100 of such scaling laws depending on what you want to call them and it had been before the second world war it had been an area because they were discovered in the 30s it was an area of significant concerns so many famous biologists had spent time thinking about it Huxley and Dassy Thompson and JBS Hall Dane and so on all some of the big names in in mid-century biology and but with the with the late forties and fifties came the molecular revolution and the discovery of DNA and the double helix and that completely changed everything and these these questions which are to do with multicellular or actually they're not just to do with multicellular organisms but to do with sort of more macroscopic behavior as everyday life scale kind of behavior. Yeah we're sort of swept under the rug and forgotten and everything returned everything turned to molecules and genes in particular genes so that that was the paradigm we should be thinking about biology and in retrospect it sort of parallels a little bit physics that you know I in my years as a high-end geophysicist I think that part of that culture was that look all we need to know is the fundamental laws and that's why the theory of everything was so important because once you got the fundamental laws we can calculate everything and everything including biology you know all it is in some weird way is turning the crank for these equations and that will pop all these models and I don't think that very many people said that explicitly nor did would they even have defended it if you asked but there was some sort of attitude exactly that underlay what was important versus what was sort of a waste of time. Exactly so exactly I don't think anybody ever said that and you're exactly right if anyone had said that people would have said well yes of course it's very important you know those fundamental laws are crucial important and they will lead to all this but it's true you will need to develop other techniques you know it would have been there would have been a very soft version but it was still there and it was in the culture and and also in the culture was in a certain sense again I did actually hear it stated but it was not very common was all the rest of those things were engineering engineering yes so you know as if that was majority by the way yes as if it were pejorative and it was very much echoed you know goes back a long way of course to the famous statement of Lord Rutherford you know the discoverer of the atom you know the famous one all science can be divided into two physics the stamp collecting yes and I was always slightly embarrassed by that and then one of my Caltech colleagues has a poster with that quote on his watch that was our proud right so this was part of it you so we know it's there and but anyway so going back to the molecular revolution and the genomics what did had evolved was a similar kind of arrogance I think as evolved that is everything so that we ended up you know not so long ago with this idea that you know it was fantastic we should map the human genome which is phenomenal and it's fantastic achievement but the hype about it was once we've done that it sort of solved everything you know very dizzy engineering after that you know we had personalized medicine and all diseases and all syndromes are going to be understood and solved and so on I mean we're at the Santa Fe Institute and one of my first visits to the Santa Fe Institute was by Leroy Hood was one of the initiators of the genome project and he was here talking about it and I listened to it was a very very good talk but he said this very explicitly and I was amazed and he was giving that talk because he wanted to get computer scientists and people think about compa involved in doing the engineering part yeah anyway and I thought at the time my god this is really extreme but we had that so so this area had migrated this area to do with organisms in particular and the more macroscopic thinking had migrated into ecology right so ecology and evolutionary and what's called evolutionary biology that became the home for some of this stuff and I got involved because I had started working on this as I said on my own and as I thought about I just I'd learned about and discover I discovered by reading I learned about all these marvelous scaling laws and I said this is unbelievable I can't believe that there isn't a theory out there that the biologists said that it's all been solved and this is now you know a whole and I discovered there wasn't any it had just stopped literally stopped in its tracks so I thought this is a marvelous problem to work on now in the context of is does physics have any relevance for biology and we have a theory that would help explain the exact phenomenon that has a curve and you fit the data yes can we derive can we construct a principled theory from which these laws can be derived and we can also make further predictions and just so we the people and audience have the direction which these things go you've mentioned that larger animals live life at a slower pace yeah so let me let me elaborate because I just said the scaling laws so let me give you some other examples so heart rates for example decrease with size but they decrease in a very regular fashion so that it is that you I said him in the metabolic rate is you take the you cube it and then you take the square root twice for heart rates they decrease according to taking the square root twice that's it the minus one fourth the minus one fourth in mathematical language and and so it is with many other things I mean the the the radius of your aorta scales with one that is the three eighths is the analog to the one quarter but you see the eighth has a four in there you don't get five sevenths you don't exactly so this number four permeated all of these scaling laws so though this is fantastic for a physicist there's a true universality and and and physicists concern that's what physicists concern themselves about at the you know at the deepest level are there systematic kind of phenomena and do they have kind of what we call universal behavior and are the universal characteristics and here was one saying something astonishing that this unbelievable unbelievable complex and diverse phenomenon called life around us is constrained by the number four yeah I mean I thought this is like magic where in the hell does this number come from so that was the state of mind I was in when I started thinking about it and I did and and the first thing you think about is what is common I mean you you realize that whatever the underlying mechanism is it must transcend the evolved design because it's true for plants trees it's true for mammals it's true for birds insects and so forth in other words there's some happy place for an organism to live an evolution gets you there gets take different paths many exactly exactly exactly can take many different paths and it gets manifested in different ways in the sense that you know we have a beating heart and the respiratory system a tree doesn't in fact we are bunch of tubes you know we're like plumbing but a tree is a bunch of fiber bundles joined together and sprays out like electrical cables sprays out so you know these are quite different engineered designs but they satisfy the same scanning laws so you know so you ask yourself something has to transcend that and then you know it doesn't take very long to think it through and realize that look the the the the huge problem that an organism has is that it's it's made up of an enormous number of components particularly cells it's got something we have we have 10 10 trillion 10 to the 14th and they have to be sustained and serviced in a roughly speaking democratic and efficient fashion and it's obvious what what has happened we've developed networks these might I wonder if you if you think in that those terms you realize you are a bunch of networks everything from yours I said circuitry respiratory systems your renal system even your bones are a big network nervous system your nervous system your neural system the very thing that you think of as you white and gray matter in your brain those are also just branching systems the synapses and neurons and axons are all networks so sorry a network of course is not a particular TV station or a TV station very good that's a picture of so I could draw a piece some dots on a whiteboard or a piece of paper and connect them with lines and that would be a network that would be a you're thinking of a particular kind of higher archic yes most of these networks that you it's not it's not absolute but most of these networks are hierarchical like your circuitry system there's a beating heart there's an aorta that comes down out and then it branches and continues to branch all the way down to serving your organs all the way down to the capillaries the feed cells so it's this branching network and you know most of the dominant networks in our bodies have that kind of characteristic so I sort of had this idea that it must be some universal features of networks there must be well in the language of physics is a universality class of networks that have this feature that have somewhere in them this one quarter this four they know about the number four they know somehow what could that be so what could that be indeed so what I did first was simply try to solve the question of how does our circuitry system work just to take that as a physics problem simple one my problem good a warm up it turned out to be quite complicated who would have guessed and it was a wonderful challenge mathematical physics challenge which I was quite frustrating at times but I enjoyed immensely I could use all of the classical mathematical methods that I'd been taught as a graduate student and I used throughout my career and they all came to bear on this and I eventually solved it and but I then in solving it I had to think what is the principle what are the principles that are constraining this network and by sorry just by solving it you mean constructing a mathematical model that matched the match I'm sorry the matched yes the real what we know about our circuitry system what the business means by solving is that's right I'm sorry yes so I have mathematical equations so you have to write the mathematical equations for the blood flow through your vessels and that's complicated because it's a pulsatile flow it's being beaten by the heart it's being boom boom boom boom and not only that it goes through a vessel and then that vessel branches yeah so some goes down one tube one down the other and so you've got to deal with that and then it bifurcates again or trifocates even so you know you had to deal with all that and so I did all that mathematics and there's all kinds of formula you derive for that but you have to constrain it it's not some arbitrary network and that's what I realized quite early on and it turned out I I put together three generic principles but only in the context of circuitry systems to begin with and then I realized later these were generalizable to all these networks and they were the following the first is the network has to be what we call space filling has to go everywhere every cell in the body has to be supplied by blood has to be supplied by oxygen of course blood oxygen yeah so so therefore the terminal unit the capillary has to end near the cell so it can be fed so that's called space filling and we know how many cells there are they fill the body sure sure second was which was something to do with natural selection as I thought about the scaling laws and our relationship to other animals other mammals and that is that yes we look quite different but we obviously have a lot in common but in particular as different mammals evolved natural selection kept certain things invariant it it had certain building blocks it did not reinvent cells in order to make a dog has distinct from an elephant it kept those same building blocks so in terms of the network the cells were essentially the same but also with things like capillaries the end of the network you don't you know that's the thing that feeds the cells so I well natural selection is naturally very lazy right it takes what you already had so as how can I improve things a little bit exactly so you don't reinvent things april or I every time and you're very posimonious in that so that was the second idea the kind of invariance of terminal units and the last was taking a real physicist viewpoint and that is that something is being optimized you know physics operates almost entirely at almost all levels particularly a fundamental level from optimization principles you know we that's all our fundamental equations of motion are derivable from optimizing the action with a beam of light goes from one point to another it takes the shortest time yeah so this is fundamental to physics and so I postulated hypothesized that the our circuitry system in particular has evolved so as to minimize the amount of energy our hearts have to do to pump blood through it you know that is and I didn't have it quite formulated at that time but I'll jump ahead it was only later when I started you know a very intense collaboration with biologists and natural selection is what they think about all the time and it was really this idea that the real reason for that from a natural selection viewpoint is that you minimize the amount of energy that is needed for the organism to stay alive to to live so that you can maximize the amount of energy you devote to reproduction and to raising of offspring so to your Darwinian fitness you want to maximize you maximize Darwinian fitness by minimizing the amount of energy that you need to support the sustain the system so this was one very specific case going back now to the circuitry system that you minimize the amount of energy our hearts have to do to pump blood through it and so we have all these equations so that's that you have three principles three principles and you have the you know the dynamics and then it's a matter of solving equations and those equations with those constraints and it's very similar to what we do you know what we were doing in field theory and high energy physics it's quite it's the same conceptual framework that is anyway out of that popped to my absolute delight and amazement this one quarter power now I have to interrupt that make it sounds very straightforward but it wasn't I struggled a great deal first of all trying to solve them and understand the biology and and a serendipitous serendipitous event occurred and that was that I got a call from the vice president of the Santa Fe Institute who said who called me up to say Jeff there are there's a biologist very well known biologist that is involved with the Santa Fe Institute and he is very interested in getting a physicist involved in trying to understand scaling laws in biology and I said I can't believe this I said I can't believe I've actually the last almost year you know as a kind of hobby I've been working on that and I think I'm close to solving it but I need a but it's fantastic I need a biology he may need a physicist I need a biologist so that it's got a very long story short that began an extraordinary collaboration with a man named Jim Brown who had moved recently to the University of New Mexico and was involved with the Santa Fe Institute and we and he had a marvelous student named Brian Inquist who is himself now a well-known ecologist and a fantastic collaboration developed where we got all this straight and it took us almost a year from then to get everything straight and it was a huge commitment by the way because I was running high-end geophysics at Los Alamos. Oh right still you have the day job. I still had a day job I was running the I was involved with the theory group and we were running we were still involved with many high-end ge experiments and I was the spokesperson or the connection with the DOE anyway and Jim ran a big ecology lab we're down in the field and so on and we both agreed to devote Fridays to this at the set of events and it was huge it was an enormous commitment that came after a few meetings and we did and it was it and it required that actually so we would meet we would meet here at the institute you know between nine and ten on a Friday morning and they would leave here about two or three in the afternoon and we would the three of us at the beginning we just beat the blackboard a lot of it was blackboard and a lot of it was just bullshit you know going back and forth because I didn't know the biology and how should I put it they were mathematically challenged so I had to take you know really things that we take so much for granted and really work hard at explaining them and they were fantastic at explaining in very simple terms biological mechanisms and and and also very importantly what is important because that in one's education that is something we don't often recognize is having a mentor who really guides you it's not actually teaching you but what is important and this is the way you should be thinking about this and to those out there who are not professional scientists we should point out this idea of standing at the blackboard and discussing things and learning things and having your feeling you're making real progress it doesn't get better than that no I absolutely thank you Sean I can't honestly it was fantastic and it doesn't get better than in a very curious way your ideas are going back and forth and you're writing equations and then you realize they're completely wrong the ideas wrong you're all complete and you get depressed so many times you're depressed or you sit there you know and suddenly with this I would sit and I think why am I involved with these guys they can't they you know they're not able to write an equation and I'm you know and I'm sure they felt the same way about me so there's all of that but that's part of it and I I've often said I know that it's not sort of like a marriage a good marriage yeah because that that all comes with it you know and so it was a phenomenal period for me and that collaboration lasted for almost about 15 years and it of course it evolved we got we got post arcs and other people joined us and other senior people joined us you know we had a chemist in join us another ecologist we had students from physics students from biology it was marvelous actually and we you know created this body of work right but I don't want to switch topics to abruptly but it wasn't too long before you went from explaining all the scaling laws and biology just saying well once I have my networks oh actually I'm sorry we didn't say where the four came from did we no so I should get that in there yes sorry it is from the networks but to put it in you know sort of simple layman's name you have to do all the calculations and you have to do it but but it is roughly what the four turns out to be is three the three of the four is a reflection of the fact that we live in three-dimensional space the space-filling that I talked about if we were six-dimensional if we lived in six dimensions it would be that that that that would that three would have been six and then there's a plus one and that so four is actually three plus one and the plus one I knew that very very loosely speaking comes from the following those principles and in particular the optimization lead to these networks being fractal like self-similar you know I mean that is they repeat themselves one you know as one goes down through the network the birds I view looks very similar to the exactly or if you cut you know if you cut a big branch of a tree and you take it away it looks like a little tree yeah and that self so-called self-similarity you can derive and that is is fed by the optimization this optimization kind of a constraint leads to that and it turns out one of the curious properties of fractal geometry is it increases what we think of the dimensionality of the system and you can increase it and and it increases it maximally and that maximality happens to be one you can't go more than one and so biological organism natural selection has taken advantage of fractal geometry to increase the dimensionality and increase its efficiency and its way of interfacing with whatever whatever the external environment is so otherwise large mammals would need enormously more caloric input to get through the day but these networks solve the problem of with maximum efficiency getting the self on the average exactly exactly so we are all manifestations of that so and there's networks all over the place there's networks all over the place and indeed somewhere along the line it started to occur to me that you know this is a paradigm for other problems and in particular social organizations and even more particular to cities cities you know and of course there's been a long history of thinking of cities as kind of super organisms and we often use metaphors from biology, the tablism of city DNA of a company and so on and so I was I started at least thinking about it and I thought well but again a certain different this event came along okay and that is I was here at the Santa Fe Institute I mean I was not part of the Santa Fe Institute but I was here on this once a week basis and I gave a colloquium one time on my biology work and in the audience were a couple of very good social scientists who said who came to me afterwards and said you know we're so intrigued by this I'm sure this weekend that we can use this to start understanding things about cities and other social organizations and it got a very long story short we formed a new collaboration uh you're getting us the impression that all great science happens by accident because you just have to do it. Well mine does in a way mine does and I don't know I feel uh when accident it happens accident I don't know if it's accidents but I often think that any um new idea that I've had I often feel has come is not to do with I know this sounds weird but it's not much to do with me but I don't think it does sound weird because one of your discoveries about cities is that they sort of provide the environment for these things to have been by letting the interactions. So I exactly so and I think that is what is happening to all of us you know and it's sort of sort of the unconscious part of the city yeah and it is so I often say the you know I even said and others and I think I probably said it in many ways the city is our greatest invention because it's a machine that brings us together and and and and and facilitates and enhances social interaction and provides positive feedback mechanisms for enhancing that to create ideas to innovate and to create wealth and you know I mean it's certainly true that most of those ideas and most of those conversations and interactions that take place don't lead anywhere or there to do with personal life you know I mean they're not but amazingly that phenomenon occasionally leads to the theory relativity or to uh Google or to you know Microsoft or to the same thing the set of it whatever but that's what a city is it is that machine for doing that. A friend of mine at theoretical physicist was you know we're having a late night conversation and he says the following he said if you divide human history into the most recent 10,000 years and all the 10 all the years before that there were a lot more people in prehistory right there a lot more people older longer than 10,000 years ago but all the good ideas seem to be in the recent 10,000 years and we were wondering why that was and there were hypotheses like well they were too busy hunting and gathering and in fact the data are that hunter gatherers like a lot of lead times. Lots of time yeah. So in fact no so it's like the city density. No the city is the mechanism by which we do this. So anyway we formed a collaboration and uh unlike the biology where I was extremely fortunate that the scaling laws had already been put together develop you know the phenomenology so to speak uh had been organized in these four books that I mentioned earlier that had been published um by the way I didn't say because these people who were quite senior people had worked on it earlier this was the end of their careers molecular revolution genetics had taken over and they were kind of summarizing. And the amazing thing about those that's when I discovered that there was no theory they just showed all this stuff. Anyway um the cities weren't not in that position. What I learned was that surprisingly no one had looked at the scaling of cities. So you want to know about how things like presumably energy use or roads or something like that change as the city gets bigger. Exactly. So you could ask you know I think the very first question we asked um when this was still an incipient collaboration um it was with the man that's now very well known sort of social physicist I don't know what you called him these days. Works in social organizations came out of physics and he'd like helping at the ETH and Zurich and his student but we worked together first um was uh how does the number of gas stations scale with city size? It's a very mundane kind of but one would guess the number of people's proportional to the number of gas stations. That's what you would have thought. Yeah, only gas. Yes, only gas. So um when we looked at the data we discovered um amazingly that it looked just like biology. It was that um it scaled in a very systematic way following this same mathematical power law scaling but the exponent the analog to the three quarters the quarter powers they mentioned earlier that was not a quarter power it was .85 meaning to put it in English that every if you doubled the size of a city instead of needing twice as many gas stations very roughly speaking you only need 85 percent. So there's this marvellous economy of scale the bigger the city and uh the original paper only looked at four European countries and they all expressed the same scaling law and uh somewhat later uh when the collaboration was was more formed more formalized um and in particular two people uh brought on board one was physicist very very good physicist named Louis Betteon Court who had been working came out again came out of nuclear physics actually um and a man named Jose Lobo who was had been associated with the Center for Institute was an urban economist um he was uh I think Cornell at the time um but they were very good data analysts and they one of the things they did was they looked at data from around the globe um just first gas stations um and discovered the same scaling law everywhere but even more amazing was that if you looked at any infrastructure at least the ones we could get data for like length of all the roads length of electrical lines water lines blah blah blah they all had the same scaling with this 15 percent this point eight five um and that was sort of amazing and it was just like biology except point eight five instead of point seven five kind of thing. Is that because cities are not truly three-dimensional space-building well we wondered about yes and in fact I think that yes from that viewpoint the answer is yes the dimensionality plays a crucial role and ultimately does but I should say right up front now I would say oh so let me back off a second so the obvious thing is again even though um you know New York doesn't it doesn't look like Los Angeles which doesn't look like Chicago which doesn't look like Santa Fe um they're all network systems and they're all doing the same thing yeah so just as the uh whale doesn't look much like an elephant which doesn't look much like a human being they're actually doing all the same things biologically and so in that sense not surprising let's scale versions of each other so it is that cities and within a given urban system are indeed scale versions one another but following in terms of the infrastructure a similar laws as biology but with a exponent of point eight five as you say to do somewhat with their dimensionality they're more too-dimensional obviously um but uh also their network systems that was the other point I mean it's clear is that the light biology their networks their road networks electrical networks what are they optimizing some equivalents the question what are they optimizing um and how much are they optimized so um in terms of those networks um I believe that in many ways those networks are optimizing things like time to get from A to B and distances you want to supply things as directly as possible but you've still got to do it in a network way because you've got to supply you know it's uh but is it safe to say we don't yet have the uh development of theory for cities that we don't so one of the thing if we we can make if we make certain generic assumptions that are quite analogous to the ones in biology but also ones to do with something that I haven't mentioned yet which distinguishes social systems and particular cities from biology and that is social networks nice this is the most important thing and is to do with what we talked about before that cities are there to enhance social networking and it is the structure of social networks that are being reflected in the socio economic quantities and if you measure socio economic quantities we find something we don't see in biology and that is a reflection of this positive feedback loop uh that occurs in social interactions and that is that we got to get your social network is calling the bigger we are um the bigger the bigger we the bigger we are the more we have for capital rather than the bigger the art we are the less per capita which dominates biology so our heart rate slows down as we have more mass right but I just love the fact that as we move into the city the pace of life in the city we literally walk faster exactly so everything goes backwards from biology yeah um the uh instead of as I said the the bigger you are the less per capita the bigger you are the more per capita the higher the wages per capita um the uh mostly the rent so and the rent obviously all these things are the higher the the amount of construction per capita goes up the number of patents produced per capita the the the innovation of a city increases the amount of crime increases per capita the amount the number of uh aids cases increases per capita all following the same systematic scaling law of an increase by about 15 percent with every doubling so it follows again the same mathematical power law scaling the exponent now is now bigger than one it's 1.15 that's the 15 percent and that's called superloneal is it possible that the physical proximity afforded by cities will someday be replaced by networks that are virtual that are online well that's a very interesting question uh I um I don't think replaced so my I used to when I first did this work I thought exactly along those lines and then I thought you know we've already had that because the invention of the telephone already did that it already made something virtual even though we know there are lines going it's we've gone one step further than that of course but you know what it did was that it contracted time I mean up until that point you could only have an interaction in with with no time delay if you will face the otherwise you had to wait hours days and in some case months and suddenly you could have the equivalent to face to face right there in your home and that had a profound influence um so um I think bigger than the uh the IT revolution right which has taken it truly virtual because it's out there in cyberspace and so forth but um and and and so I would say that the uh IT revolution has done what the telephone and by the way things like the steam engine did because by the way the railroad did something sort of like the telephone it contracted space shrunk the world shrunk the world because until the railroad uh most people um didn't move more than 10 to 20 miles from their home in their entire life didn't I read from you that no matter what the transportation system is people have an average commute time of an hour but now yes that's a the standard number that uh but joggers that have an hour each way yes half an hour okay yeah that that actually works it's been expanded to an hour uh you know now in some places but yeah so the size of a city it was been suggested the the traditional size of a city typically this is this is very hand waving is given by the how far you can move in actually now one hour by whatever the transport is so it's just expanded with the transportation and now you're not shy about having policy recommendations on the basis of this point of view right I mean we we're making choices about how to live how to govern ourselves what to do for our infrastructure what what to be learned from these well I have been no I have actually been quite I interact quite a lot with um the uh you know policy makers and the over joggers and urban economists um but I'm I I'm very low to make explicit policy decisions or recommendations other than the following this I'm passionate about the urban urban planning in particular has a very checkered history it is it is operated urban planning both in terms of building new developments in enlarging cities mitigating problems building new cities roughly speaking has worked by rule of thumb this is what we've done in the past this is what we do it's very truly phenomenological not what would make it theoretically not so it worked you know this is where we did it and I've learned that not just from reading the literature but I've given talks at big conferences and people have come up to me and said listen I run a company I'm well building a small town of 15,000 people and I had no idea any of this existed and we just you know the way we bit well you know we should have a park here I mean I'm exaggerating a little bit but you know but that's what it is and it's very much rules of thumb and it is no accident that all the since almost all synthetic cities have been failures Brazillia Canberra even Washington DC it's taken a long time from Washington DC to become a real city and so on it's Lama Bad they've all been essential disasters and we're seeing repeated tragically I think in China because China has this pressure to build several hundred new cities in the next 25 years and you know they're just building them willy nilly just buildings and soulless and it's going to have horrible repercussions and it is already actually well I'm very sad because we are running out of time but let's circle back to where we started because you mentioned this question of I don't know whether it's a responsibility or at least the question of how scientists relate to the usefulness of what they do very good some of us myself included have rarely done a piece of science that directly improves the life of anyone but me and my friends and other fans of theoretical physics and cosmology other scientists of course have changed the world in dramatic ways how should we think about this yes so I of course like you I most of my careers I said it's in high-end geophysics and I'd never done a practical thing in my life however and I had a faith and it is a faith that you know understanding more and more deeply eventually has profound implications not just for you know because of for its own say but actually propagates through and in some way we don't fully understand but in some diffusive way actually influences the world we live in and so let me give you an example that influenced me tremendously in very in my when I was a graduate student so when I was a graduate student I was I'm a I'm a terrible experimentalist I was terrible I almost failed every time in both as an undergraduate graduate student getting a degree because I couldn't do the bloody experiments but I always felt one thing I did feel was that physics was sort of at some level in experimental science because that's its power that you can not only observe but you can test and you know there's literative scientific methodology and so I thought you know it'd be good to go into a lab and really see how it all works and at that time I was a graduate student at Stanford and my name Arthur Schalo had joined the faculty he been at Bell Labs and was the co-inventor of the laser he got the Nobel Prize for it a little bit later and he was just setting up a lab and I was his third graduate student and I joined him and I told him exactly what I just said but I'd like to do it and see and I said maybe I'll stay and be with anyway I was a terrible expert after this and I did it and I'm not by the way it was a terrible theorist and so it was very good because I was sort of the house theorist and I would explain you know papers theory papers to him it's a really nice symbiotic relationship but one day at night in the lab we had it art had in his lab because we had this biggest laser in the world actually and and I was talking to him about being a scientist I'm going to be a scientist and I said but I'm going to hide you physics and it's so useless and it's you know and you've done you know you were Bell Labs at least and and I said like this now you're doing work that is obviously useless I said you know I mean you know this has got nothing to do with anything obviously it's marvelous it's marvelous atomic physics or you're resurrecting atomic physics from the ashes and it's marvelous but it's obviously got nothing to do with anything and he said Jeffrey you're completely wrong he said I look he said this is going to revolutionize the world because he said you know we always show where we have visits to the land we take this big block of wood and we fire the laser we drill a hole through it do you realize that we're going to have lasers powerful enough that we're able to drill holes through steel not only that we're able to cut steel to extraordinary accuracy and this is going to revolutionize the entire planet he was completely wrong he did not revolutionize the planet it did revolutionize a teeny bit of industry of course and it's allowed laser surgery but it did not he was wrong but he was also right that it did something to invent the laser revolutionize in a serendipitous totally un non predictable way and that is the nature of course of basic research we have no idea you know who in the hell knows it could be I well I don't even speculate but it does so that influenced me tremendously I mean I'd like to think that this influence propagates forward but I do worry that I just have a motivation for thinking that but then the second event and that was much later so I was at a post-doc at Cornell and I got to know many Robert Wilson who was an extraordinary man and he became a director of family lab which was that period you know the biggest accelerator before we had the LHC and so on and he had to go through some rough times in congress being attacked for exactly this question and there is a famous occasion when he was being strongly attacked about you know the role of this kind of research and the question came from a senator saying you know Mr. Wilson this is all wonderful stuff you know it's marvelous to know these laws but what has he got to do with anything for example he said what has he got to do with the defense of this country you know it's coming from the Department of Energy where we make bombs and so on what what the hell does learning about these elementary particles and the symmetries and all the things you've told us about got to do with the defense of the country and Bob Wilson said senator I have absolutely no idea how this will help the defense of the United States but it will make the United States worth defending and there was spontaneous that's the spirit in which we do this I think that's right I think as you know as well as anyone else average human being has three billion heartbeats and it's about what we're going to do with them you know it's fun to try to extend our lives but also we're living our lives and discovering new things about the universe it's one of the best ways and that's what's being a human being is and I think that is the highest level to which we should all attain actually we should all try to aspire to and somewhere or another and you know science has that characteristic and working on problems that seem to be have no practical perceived influence on the world around us is you know is one of the things that should be supported and one of the sad things that has happened in the intervening years is more and more the funding agencies are focusing on you know what have you done for me lately and how is this going to help immediately well hopefully our little podcast can do a tiny bit well I hope so because I mean it's ironic that I've ended up working on things that could be perceived as being very practical it's and and I hope have again but with a physicist big picture world view of thinking about these systems well Jeffrey West thank you so much for having me thanks for the compensation
