 Hi everyone and thank you for joining me today for episode 795 of People Behind the Science with our guest Dr. Ronaldo Polimonte. I'm your host Dr. Marie McNeely and if you want to get connected with us to hear about even more amazing people doing great science, you can find us on Facebook and we're also on Blue Sky at PBT Science and I'm at PhD Marie. We're excited to get connected with all of you and I'm excited to share a fantastic conversation with today's guests. So listeners, I hope you're ready to meet another one of our outstanding people behind the science. Every day discoveries are made that will change our understanding of the world around us. Dr. Marie McNeely is here to bring you the brilliant minds who are making these discoveries so they can share their incredible stories and take you on an amazing journey. Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to People Behind the Science. Today I am thrilled to be speaking with our guest scientist Dr. Ronaldo Polimonte. So Ronaldo, welcome to the show today. How are you? Good and very happy to be here and thank you so much for being back. Well, thank you so much for joining us and I'm excited to tell our listeners a little bit more about you and how you got to where you are today. So listeners, Ronaldo is an associate professor of psychiatry and he also has appointments in biomedical informatics and data science as well as chronic disease epidemiology at the Yale University School of Medicine, the School of Public Health and the Wu-Sai Institute. Ronaldo completed his bachelor's degree, master's degree and PhD at the University of Rome, Torvigatha. Afterwards, he conducted post-doctoral research at the Yale University School of Medicine before joining the faculty at Yale. He has received a variety of awards and honors for his work including the One Mind Rising Star Computational Psychiatry Research Award and Explorers Award from the Simon's Foundation Autism Research Initiative, the Early Career Investigator Award from the Million Veteran Program and Young Investigator Awards from the Journal Jeans, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation and the International Society of Applied Biological Sciences. And today, Ronaldo, we want to get to know you as a researcher of course but also as a person. So can you start by telling us what do you like to do when you're not very busy doing science? I'm not a very active person, but I tend to be kind of lazy. The thing that I like the most is age-reading because I can do it on my couch. So I like to read anything from novels to more scientific books about other areas that I'm not working on. I like to eat, I like to try different types of food and I like to travel. So I like to go around, see different countries and see different architectures, people interacting in different ways. These are the three main things that I like to do when I'm not working. So that's fantastic. I think we've got hobbies and common here reading, food and travel are things that I love as well. So what are some of your favorite foods? I'm Italian, no? Definitely. I like Italian food, how authentic Italian food. So you probably know that Italians can be very big here about their stuff. I like sushi, like sushi is one of the things that I think I like the most. I live in New Haven and New Orleans is very diverse in terms of restaurants. It's not a big city, but there are plenty of restaurants to try and I like to go around. So probably in the first six months when they moved to Yehla, I tried all the restaurants and I had trends that were living in Yehla for so long and they didn't try all the restaurants that they tried in my first six months and you haven't. So I should undo it, but I like to eat out and like try things. Definitely. I think it's a good way to explore new cuisine, find things that you might otherwise make it home yourself. And you mentioned reading as well. We love talking about books on the show and giving our listeners some recommendations if they're looking for their next great read. So we're not oh, what is a book that you'd like to recommend for everybody today whether it's related to science or not? So one thing that I'm starting to read more is about books, written by scientists, but they talk about their science, but they talk about their life and the issues that they had while like doing amazing things because again, these are kind of people that were asking to write a book. So like one that I read recently, but it's not a new book, it's kind of not super old, but Polish. So data, that is the common thread science, politics, and ethics, and the human genome. This was written by one of the scientists that led the human genome project, which is the project that sequenced the human genome for the first time in the early 2000, like 2001, we was completed. It's a very nice book because you can read about the person behind the scientists and also about K and because this was a massive project with so many investigators involved and there is also like competition because there was two parallel efforts and this is from the the government fund that there was mainly from the US and the UK, they were funding this project. So from public funding and then there was a pirate company that was also like trying to do the same. So there was this huge competition and because it was about genetic data and the implication for that, there was a legal issue about adding a company finishing first the sequencing of the human genome and maybe try to patent certain genes. So like it's a really good book because you can understand more about all the things going on behind the science. Again, this was a massive project, but again every project you are competing with other scientists and then you need to also focus on how you are going to fund what you want to do and that's not an easy task. So like sometimes people that are working science think that scientists they have to focus only on their science, but there is a word around that and I think this is a very nice book to learn about it. Well, this is an excellent recommendation, Rado. We will add this and I love these books that really highlight the stories as you mentioned behind the scientists and the scientific discoveries and this one in particular kind of ties into your own research interests. So let's talk about that next Rado, how do you describe it? You do to someone who is outside of science or perhaps outside of your scientific field. My primary research is about human genetics from different perspectives because I started a non-group that was more focused on molecular anthropology. So understanding genetic diversity, worldwide population and then I became more interested in time to understand the predisposition to disease and then was during my PhD and then I moved at Yale and I started to work on secondary disorder. What I'm currently working on, the main focus of my work is trying to understand the molecular mechanism that are disposing certain individuals to develop psychiatric disorders and symptoms and again, like secondary disorder is a wider range of health outcomes and so like within this group, I will this is the one that I'm more focused on is so called the internalizing disorder. So depression, anxiety, traumatic stress disorder and print on the stand what are the mechanisms that are disposing certain individuals to develop this disease and in this area, I'm also trying to understand like why people that have this disease take into account so so other negative health outcomes. So for example, there is a known commodity between post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease. So like there are a lot of hypothesis about what's going on there, if people that have post-traumatic stress disorder then develop cardiovascular disease as a consequence of PTSD or is maybe due to other shared auto-genetic mechanism, what I'm doing is try to use genetic data, but other other molecular data like thrascritomic and epigenetics to try to understand what is predisposing people to get sick. Very interesting and I love how you bring all of these different disciplines together for this sort of multidisciplinary approach that you take with genetics, molecular biology, psychology, psychiatry. Was it sort of a difficult learning curve as you were bringing all of these fields together? Sometimes it was by chance my primary interest when I was in college was on tribology and then because I was in a biology program, I connected the anthropology with like a molecular study and genetics. So I was interested in human evolution. But then during my PhD, there was the possibility to do kind of like a study focused on disease and the first disease that I focused on was asthma because we were allowed that were generally genetic data. We were started to collaborate with an hospital and I was actually doing the recruitment. So I was talking with participants, explaining the study, collecting the formation, collecting the biological samples. So like I was doing it from the beginning to the end. So I was talking with the participants, collecting the biological sample, bringing the samples to the lab, doing the DNA extraction, then the genotyping. So the molecular analysis to understand the genetic variation of each participant and doing then the data analysis. From there I was very interested to connect human evolution with the disease predisposition and there was something that I was trying to connect and I'm still trying to do that. And then by chance I got an author to move to Yale and work in SEGAE genetics during maybe PhD. So it was something new and so like I moved and it was kind of like a phase where I had to learn more about SEGAE disorders and the challenges to investigate these health outcomes that are specific to this domain and from there I learned more and right now I'm trying to bring all the knowledge that I got over the years about human evolution, disease that are physical health outcomes. So asthma, cardiovascular disease Alzheimer and connect data with my corrent interest, the which is SEGAE disorders and in particular internalizing disorders. Well or not I think you have created a fascinating little niche in the research world for yourself. And I think having this opportunity like you mentioned to work with participants can be really motivating and can really drive home the potential impacts of the work that you do. And I know for a lot of people the first time they get to work with participants this is what sells them on a career and kind of more clinically oriented research. So I love talking about what motivates scientists or what inspires them and one thing that really helps me get through a tough day is a motivational quote or a saying or just something I can keep in my mind. So do you have a favorite motivational quote or something that really motivates you in your life or science. The quote that I like which is genius says one percent inspiration ninety nine percent perspiration and it's not because I believe that I'm a genius. It's only because the rest of the work is more about how I got to where I am now is that maybe I got an idea but then like getting the idea or writing an idea about how to answer a scientific question is only the first step of a very long process. And it's a lot of artwork is on the only getting I got an idea and so I can solve this issue is oh I got an idea and then I have to convince other people that this idea is good and so I need to get funding to support this idea. And then after you get funding you need to coordinate a group and make the idea real so translate the idea interacting participants interacting with collaborators and generate data and then address possible issues because there are always issues and things that don't work as we expect and then generate the data try to understand what they are telling you because sometimes the data that you are generating they are not in line with what you put the size of the beginning and so you have to understand them. Those most of the times things are much more complicated that we expect and we need to try to understand what they are telling us. That's the bottom why I like this work. Definitely and I think there's a lot of hard work that goes behind every scientific discovery even these kind of small papers could be years in the making and I think what helps us get through some of these challenging long projects are the people that you get to work with in science. So whether they're mentors or peers who are helping cultivate some of your research ideas or just these inspirational figures that you've looked up to in your career or not are there people who you think of as mentors or role models who have really helped you get to where you are today. Of course I had mentors, I had my mentor at Tielu and I moved to Charles Gellentero which is someone that I look up to and there are like also again my department chair of my department I someone that is doing 1000 things at the same time and all the things are a super high quality and so these are people that I look up to and say how can they do what they do I wouldn't be able to do that so I try to get inspiration for that but what usually I try to look up is how different scientists work and I try to get things that I like things that I don't like and then try to be the best combination of all the things that I like and I want to be so I try to be kind of a puzzle of many different pieces and they say I like the way this person interacted with their collaborators or like I like how this person is able to engage participants and I try to put on quotes to steal from all the people that I have around getting inspired by everyone is around me and like the asiño persona or a trainee and working sciences that inspired me because you are able to make amazing people from all over the world and travel all over the world and no other people that are working in different areas. Definitely and I love this idea of really assembling your own ideal career based on these different pieces that you learn that you borrow from others around you and you mentioned that already in college you were stored of getting interested in anthropology starting to get interested in potentially a scientific career path but if we could rewind it back even further we're not okay do you tell us a little bit more about your scientific beginnings and maybe what turned your eye towards science in the first place? In college I wasn't always very interested in the possibility to work in academia and the time to think about fundamental issues that was interested at that time again in my family there are not people that are academics and so like no one had to kind of carry it so it wasn't from my family actually they were not really understanding why I wanted to work in a academia and to be a scientist because it wasn't something that anyone in my family did. I was very interested at the time to think about fundamental issues because like outside academia depending on like the working accompany or if you have your own business you have to deal with more tactical issues which again it's great if you like the kind of stuff because again if you look at academia and say oh you have thinking about this fundamental issue but what you are actually making to change teams of to improve these that's what I like in academic design and you think about fundamental issues and so like the things that you are delivering may have not an immediate impact on people but long term the opus that they will change in a major way or this is the op for every scientist but only few people are able to make that kind of big impact on people's life. Certainly and you mentioned that no one in your family had necessarily pursued this academic career path how did you get interested in science if this wasn't where the inspiration came from kind of what was that first thing that made you think this is what I want to do. When I was doing my master I was interacting with people that were doing a PhD or a postdoc or like junior faculty or more senior faculty and they liked the kind of life working on a project going to conferences, talking with other scientists and that was the life that I really liked the kind of like possibility to focus on scientific issues and again at that time I was more interested in human evolution so to work on human evolution it's something that you can do only in an academic environment. I don't think there are companies or businesses that are focusing on human evolution right now that was the reason why I got into this kind of research and then from there like I learned more about biomedical research and what I like about academia what I like it from the beginning academy is the freedom of develop your own ideas get your own perspective on possible questions and still what I like the most in a pyramid is the freedom again is an off-hand freedom because then you need to find funding and support to develop your own ideas which sometimes it takes a lot of work. Definitely and we mentioned in our introduction that you had done your bachelor's degree your master's degree in your PhD all at the same academic institution and then you made the jump all the way over here to Yale so can you talk a little bit about how that came about that opportunity for a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale. This goes back to my quote-unquote laziness because actually I lived only in two cities in my life, Rome, in Italy and in the US one of the things I like a lot about academia is this possibility to travel the world and connect with people that are very far from you. The opportunity at Yale there was a job opening to propose the Catele and then I applied and then I got an interview and after that I got the job so like it was kind of unexpected because actually at the beginning I didn't want to move to the US I wanted to stay in Europe but then like again the reputation of Yale and the person that had this opening and the opportunities to learn made me make the decision oh yes this is what I should do now so like I made the job. That's because a scientist in their career most of the time they have to move around they have to change places and get an environment to get different perspectives and get new ideas so that's another of the days that I got a lot about science especially in the US that people really move around for their job and then I think you were fortunate you did not have to move around when you were looking for a faculty position. Can you talk about that transition from post talk to faculty? So because I'm in a clinical department or at least in Yale clinical departments there is more the possibility to transition from a trainee position to a faculty position so like I was at that certain time in again of my postdoc where I was starting to talk with my mentor about my next steps and I was seeing other openings in other universities but he liked the work that I was doing so like also the chair and the leadership of my department I was interested in the work that I was doing so they made me an author to stay which was a positive thing because you don't need to do a moving which is kind of time consuming but the same times you have to demonstrate that again it's not only because you train that Yale that you are a Yale faculty it's also because you are kind of awarded and it was like also a challenge for me to demonstrate that I can build my own research program and I can create my research group independent from term I being from the love that they joined as a poster. Excellent well I appreciate you sharing your career path and giving us some insight into how you got to where you are today and you are doing some remarkable research there at Yale we talked about it a little bit but is there a project that you have going on right now or not oh that you are just the most excited about and want to share with me and listeners today. One project that we are working really hard right now is about internalizing so depression and anxiety and post-traumatic stress and what we are trying to do now is to understand how these disorders are associated with COVID-19 outcomes so like because of the pandemic and the peak changes that we had to overcome the pandemic during the pandemic and after the pandemic there is this evidence about acumen beginning between certain secondary disorders and COVID-19 but because people that got severe COVID-19 may have developed this disease after or people that had again preserved that before the disease were more predisposed to have more severe symptoms and so what we are trying to do now is to understand which are the more molecular basis of this commodity and trying to understand possibly which could be the long term consequence of these associations so this was a project that was very interesting because we started with the recruiting new participants because again COVID-19 is an outcome a disease that we had only recently so like we are rolling new participants for this study we connected with communities in the New Heaven area to have a diverse course that can represent people with different backgrounds and that was very rewarding because again you connect with participants but it's a two-way road you want them to participate in the study but at the same time you have to explain what is the study is about and what you are doing and what can help people with what we are doing that was very rewarding because I was able to connect with people more directly and then after that again we got the biological samples and we are doing molecular analysis right now and we look to get the results that can help people to understand better how the impact of COVID-19 can affect mental health long term. I think this is very interesting and I think in a very important area of research as well and I think there's a lot of other factors that come into play here whether it's age physical activity etc etc the list could go on and on what are some of the factors that you're thinking about that might also be part of this equation of how these things are related. There are many factors like also socioeconomic factors people that got exposed to more risk environments so that they were more likely to get exposed or people that had other comorbidities that they're exposed time to have more severe outcomes medications that people were taking vaccination status is something that we are also looking at these are all aspects so we have a longer assessment with hundreds of patients that we are asking to participants and the idea is to kind of use this big data and trying to understand which are the factors more relevant possible different between the sexes we see that many women are differently affected by this comorbidity because for example for internalizing disorders we know that women tend to have a higher prevalence of depression on society and post-traumatic stress disorder and so we want to understand how this is going to be affecting COVID-19 outcomes between people that didn't have any severe symptoms and people that had severe symptoms due to the infection. This is a fascinating project Ronaldo we look forward to seeing the results coming out in the future and I know it can be really exciting too like you said be able to make those connections within your community to be able to go out in the field so to speak but I think there are challenges with that kind of research and just challenges with science in general as we hinted at previously so I'd love to talk about some of these challenges that you have faced is there an example of a major failure that you've had or just a problem that you really struggled with that you could tell us about and maybe talk us through how you worked through that tough time. The biggest challenge that I had as a scientist it was really at the very beginning I defame myself as a computational biology so most of the time I worked on my computer and connecting with servers in the US all around the world and analyzing molecular data and clinical data of sometimes millions of people but there is a reason why I am a computational biologist so when I started I mentioned that I was doing basically all the steps from recruiting participants to analyze data like generated molecular data on the bench so with my pipette and I was generated a kind of data which between doing the analysis of the data and generated the molecular data I think the tailagged the most was analyzing the data and one of the reason is because I wasn't really good on the bench like doing pipette things like cherry the molecular data later for the analysis so at the really beginning one of the challenges that I had was with contamination contamination in genetics is when you are doing some kind of genetic analysis of an individual and instead of all in genotyping that individual you are also somehow getting DNA that is not from that leader but is from people that are around you in the lab and at the really beginning in the lab that I was for one of these projects that we were starting we were having some issues about contamination so we were not able to discriminate which individuals were with are analyzing and so we had to find a way to clean things up in the lab and separate things more and it took probably a month this was that we were scaling up the number of samples that we were analyzing this created some kind of not completely clean environment to ensure the quality of the data which are anything and so it took a couple of months to organize everything and that was the time that I was starting and I was really struggling to find a solution and we were discussing with other people in the lab about to make things work at that time I was really in a tough place because again I was just starting so I was the first time that I was struggling and I was questioning I would like to be a scientist but maybe I'm not good enough that was probably the toughest challenge that I had to overcome and it was the real at the beginning in some cases it can be good to sort of get those out of the way early so you know what you're getting into but at the same time I think that troubles you and can be so frustrating sometimes particularly when you don't even know enough to know what you should be changing yeah but overcoming challenges is something that sank is I have to get used though it's something that always I tell to my greenies and sort of simple in computational biology especially for people that are just starting to learn is basically like learning a new language so I say you are learning it doesn't seem like that you are learning because again you are struggling to debug your code and to learn how to code the commands but you are actually happy is only that it takes time especially at the beginning to get out some results so like what I said you were to try to be resilient and be able to continue to do what they are doing and also I say look if I see that things are not progressing I'm going to tell you so you need to trust me that things are moving along you are learning it's only that you take sometimes to get results out definitely and I think that can be helpful just to have a good supportive mentor to help you out if you get stuck and encourage you to keep moving forward because I think those successes and science can be so rewarding when you get to them so Ronaldo do you have a favorite success story whether it was a really big win or even just a small but particularly meaningful victory for you that you'd like to tell us about today that is a recent study that we published and it was a study that again like several of the studies we are doing in collaboration with the other groups in the US and around the world because again collaborative science is very important especially for our genetic research where we need big data sets like they include millions of individuals but in our recent study we were able to get access to data from different sources and do like a large genetic study of anxiety disorders in 1.2 million individuals and this was a study that we did only now a group so like the people that contributed mainly to the study are people that are in my lab it was particular rewarding because we had a lot of people that learned the the start of the lab and learned something the lab and we were able to contribute so it was only a group effort and again we were able to complete the study to publish the study and we got really who's feedback from a lot of scientists around the world that appreciate the work that we did definitely and I know in this study you in the group identified more than 100 genes associated with anxiety so can you talk about what are the potential impacts of this work? So yes that was very exciting because again like for many other segregated disorders were already present a large number of genes that were associated with different mental illnesses and this was the first time for anxiety that we were able to identify such large number of genes so with this information what we our group and other groups around the world because again like once we've honestly studied we also released the data that we used is that we are trying to translate this information time to identify possible molecular targets for defining drugs that can help people again this is not means that we are going to have a new drug or find a better drug for anxiety in six months one yet but it's a very long process where we are trying to identify which are the biological processes that are underlining these genes so like again with 100 genes we can define that if multiple genes are in the same biological process and what is how this biological process is related to anxiety and maybe able to identify a drug that can target this to prevent this pathogenic process leading to anxiety so this is something that we are currently working on trying to translate these genetic associations in information about the disease and information that can help people affected by the disease again is not something that we are going to able to do in the short term but it's a work that will contribute to this process definitely I think don't sell yourself short this is an important step on that path to hopefully getting to a better care or better treatment for people with these anxiety disorders so how did you celebrate this exciting win when that paper was accepted or when the project was completed if I have to think about it I don't think we actually celebrate so we celebrated with telling congratulations to everyone that was great but we didn't have a party about it which maybe was hard to happen because the other thing which I do to myself is that after I get something like this study published because until the study is published the work is not done but then after the work is done there are other things that you have to think about there was like a very little celebration maybe too little and then we move immediately to other things because that's think about being a scientist there are always new things that you are chasing so sometimes I don't take time to say oh we as a group were able to accomplish this but instead like oh what did this let's move on I think that is a remarkable accomplishment and I think wonderful that you're able to kind of have that experience of a big success with the members of your laboratory and we mentioned earlier in our conversation that you are passionate about travel and I think this is a really fun aspect of careers in science as well because you get to travel for conferences to work with colleagues all over the world so do you have a favorite place that your science has taken you Ronaldo I just came back from a travel in Singapore for a conference and again a Singapore is an amazing place and I was able to travel to Thailand and again these are amazing countries my favorite country that I ever went to for work is Japan is an amazing place I was there for three weeks for two conferences so there were two different conferences around the same time and so I was able to stay there for three weeks and I fell in love with the place it's an amazing place I like to visit because you have a lot of history to look around and the food is amazing and people are amazing and I'm really looking forward to go back but I was not able to it was again I went to Japan probably more than five years ago and I'm still trying to find a way to go back but again it was a work and life it's not that close that you can say oh let's take a long weekend there very well I think these travel opportunities can be absolutely amazing to be able to go to places like you said that are far away that you might not otherwise be able to go to and you said three weeks in Japan what areas were you able to visit and were you able to do some sort of fun sight seeing along the way I was in Tokyo and then in Kumamoto which is as most city in the south the last thing is that the two conferences that I had were one week apart of each other so I did one week the first conference in Tokyo then I took one week to visit a little bit of Japan and then the third week I went to Kumamoto in the south for the second conference it was a perfect trip like I had a lot of fun and again I had the opportunity to meet other scientists from different countries because depending on where the conferences you sometimes have different people attending so if you go to a conference in Asia you are able to connect more with people in Asia in Australia if you have a conference in the US you are able to get more than we see in the North American South America and Europe it's also nice to change because you are able to connect with different scientists. Oh absolutely I think these travel opportunities are wonderful and the four listeners are able to go to Japan soon will be jealous but what must they do or see while they're there is there something that you think they have to put on their itinerary you can just work around and enjoy the nicest thing is that you have like ancient temples and modern buildings I'm talking about Tokyo it's amazing how these two things can live together and they can live together in harmony it's not that for example I am from Rome which we have a lot of ancient buildings there but sometimes you see like modern buildings and ancient buildings don't live well together instead like my feeling in Japan is that was in Artoni and for example you were able to go in a park in the middle of Tokyo which it's a very dense city with a lot of buildings a lot of people and then you go in a park and seems to be in a completely different world because you have this ancient temple and quiet around you and instead you are in the middle of the city it was amazing that sounds easy to get away from sort of the buzz of the city with these kind of quiet places interest first yeah that sounds lovely and I think one of the other things that's wonderful that you highlighted here is just the ability to meet with scientists from all over the world and I think oftentimes scientists are portrayed a particular way in the media and we try to break some of those stereotypes by just showcasing these human moments in science the fun funny strange and creative things that scientists do in there together whether it's quirky lab traditions or just funnier fun memories that you shared with colleagues so do you have an example of one of these human moments that you could share with us today Ronaldo that is something that I think is very human it was when I was doing my PhD in Italy in the department where I was so it was the lab where I was at the time and other labs around we had which is maybe very brilliant thing to do on Friday instead of having lunch in the university near the lab where there was the dining area we went to have lunch outside we went to a place that was very close to the university and on Friday in Rome you're supposed to have fish and we were having almost every Friday spaghetti with clams and some fried calamari and I was kind of became a tradition for the time that I was there so it was really fun and you were able to connect with people in other labs and talk about science but also talk about life so like it was a nice way to connect especially students should be able to do this kind of activities because it kind of helped them to relax because sometimes especially when you are very young and you are not used to the challenges of the work I can become very stressful and so sometimes you have to step out and read talk about something else and then you can go back especially at that time so sometimes I'm working on something I'm not able to find the solution if I step outside think about something else and go back to that my brain is kind of relaxed and is able to find out that's the way I should do so I think it's a very important for students to be able to understand that sometimes you need to step back and relax definitely and I think investing that time to build your network to build those relationships with colleagues is really valuable as well and I just I love the idea of celebrating the end of the week by just getting outside seeing the sun enjoying great food together so I think that's a wonderful tradition and I know you are working on some big problems big questions in the lab that you're in at the moment so let's talk about what you would do if we took away all of the barriers I know often in science funding staff technology time feasibility you name it the list could go on and on are often holding us back from answering the questions we would most like to answer so Ronaldo if you could do anything what is the one research question you want to answer most the question that I would like to answer is how human evolution shaped the disposition of certain disease is something that I'm already doing but I would like to be even in a larger scale for example a major limitation that we have in genetic research is that most of the data that we have right now were generated from participants of you to be understand we don't have enough diversity especially with to represent the diversity that we have around the world and this is a big limitation but for biomagical research in general but also to understand human evolution because the more diverse is the little we have the more information we can get about how this diversity was generated and which were the dynamics that led to what we are seeing right now if I could have I wish to do something like the bigger or what I'm doing is that more diverse the other sets and being able to have something that actually reflected the variation that we see around the world with that kind of data we would be able to understand better which are these dynamics the kind of like shabeta our history but also are determining our future in terms of disease risk that would be the big question that I would like to answer and make the connection between these two things because sometimes they are seen as separate issues especially because in our genome is the product of our evolution and is determining the disposition of future disease so these two things are well connected and so like what I would like to have is more diverse data again the character sense actually what we have around the world and then use this data to connect these two aspects well I think this is fascinating I really love this idea really just upscaling the research that you're doing enriching these data sets with more representative data and I think this is something where we're slowly chipping away at the problem but there's a lot of work that remains to be done so we appreciate you bringing up this big picture question for us to ponder today and I'd love to end with sharing advice so Renato you've shared your career path and I think you've had some wonderful experiences along the way is there a piece of advice that somebody gave you at some point that really helped you that you want to share with listeners today I think the advice that shaped the most my career is to be persistent science takes time and scientists have to deal a lot with the rejections we deal more with the rejection of their acceptances it's persistence and resilience be able to grow up thick skin and be able to have a good balance you should listen to people but not too much you may have your own idea and sometimes when ideas are very new and question established truth that sometimes not correct you will find people pushing back to you but maybe you're right you need to be able to listen to people but also sometimes be able to stick with your ideas and try to prove them so it takes time and it takes rejections people they want to be scientists will have clever rejected grant application rejected it sometimes is up because you put a lot of efforts on there and people constantly self all the time I still do that so people are persistent trust yourself but not too much it's a fine line like between okay I have an idea I want to demonstrate that is correct and sometimes being too arrogant and not listening to what is around you so it's a very fine line that sometimes we have to work definitely I think that is such an important point in terms of the balance that you mentioned sort of trust yourself and trust others but neither too much yes that's summary well I love that advice is there any other last message that you'd like to share with listeners at the end of our conversation today it's very related to what I just said but hard work pays out sometimes you need to work to move along and sometimes you have to be resilient and continue to work also if you are not seeing results and so sometimes you have to think long term that's what still I'm doing so when I start this I'm giving me five years to try to become a scientist and see if I can do this as a career and I still do that sometimes I say right now maybe it's an art time and it's okay I'm giving me that amount of time to try to prove myself that this is the way I should do I love that I think keeping that big picture in mind and setting those longer term goals can be helpful and sort of slowly working towards them so we appreciate you sharing these insights and advice with listeners if our listeners would like to learn more about you Renato and the work that you're doing what is the best way for them to do so that is my webpage on the Yale website where people can look information about my email and my social media accounts so people can reach me out via email they can look updates about their search theft my group is doing they can also connect via social media Twitter LinkedIn usually I reprise people that connect with ask questions from these different sources and I'm happy to talk about science again for people that I interested in a particular topic or also like students that would like to learn more about how they can make a career as a scientist I'm actually interacting with people about these topics fantastic well listeners definitely get connected with Renato learn more about the exciting work that he's doing and Renato thank you so much for joining us on the show today it was such a pleasure to chat with you thank you so much you for having been right this was really nice questions they went to all my career and maybe remember about issues that I had in the past and funding so also it was great we appreciate you sharing your path and listeners it's been wonderful to have you here as well join us again next time for another episode of people behind the science
