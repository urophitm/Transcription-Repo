Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to People Behind the Science. Today I am looking forward to speaking with our guest scientist Dr. Ruchita Singh. So Ruchita, welcome to the show today. How are you? I'm doing good. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Well, thank you so much for joining us and I'm excited to learn more about you and more about the wonderful work that you're doing. But before we get into those details, let me first take a moment to tell our listeners a little bit more about who you are and how you got to where you are today. So listeners, Ruchita is an associate professor and the recipient of the Dean's Professorship in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, where she also has joint appointments in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and the Center for Visual Science. She received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from JNTU in India and she completed her graduate studies in physiology at Kansas State University. Next, Ruchita connected postdoctoral research and pharmacology at Yale School of Medicine, followed by a postdoctoral position in stem cell research at the University of Wisconsin Medicine. She joined the faculty there at the University of Rochester in 2014 and Ruchita, today we are excited to get to know you as a scientist of course, but also as a person. So can you start by telling us what do you like to do when you're not doing science? I truly enjoy spending time with my kids. I have a six-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter and they both give me so much joy. We don't do anything in particular, but small things bring so much joy to them. Like going to McDonald's or the park, I'll be able to go to as the kid section of our local public library where my son plays, my daughter, browser's books and I catch up on my emails and work all at the same time. That sounds amazing. I think spending time with family can be a great way to unwind after a busy day in the lab and I know you're doing some amazing work in the lab and I'd love to touch on that as well. So Ruchita, how do you describe what you do to someone who's perhaps outside of science or maybe just not familiar with your specific field? So I mostly, again, this is talking to like students and my daughters, cool and stuff. Basically, I tell them I'm a scientist that walks on the eyes. I try to understand why some people and some kids cannot see as well as others and use that knowledge to develop treatments for specific eye diseases like age-related molecular degeneration to do this. I take skin of blood samples from people that either can see well or those that cannot see so well and have vision problems. I convert them into stem cells and then use them to make cells from the eyes that we then study in the laboratory. By making eye cells from people that have the disease and those that don't have the disease allows us to compare what are the differences between these cell types and this knowledge allows us to understand more about why some people cannot see as well as the others and this is important for developing treatments for eye diseases. Well, that makes sense. I know age-related macular degeneration is a really common form of vision loss or common cause of vision loss. So for people who aren't familiar with what this term means, could you describe it briefly? So age-related macular degeneration is age-related irreversible blindness. So basically, the part of your retina, the central retina, the macular, the cells and the photoreceptors, the light sensing cells stop working and so that reduces your ability to be able to see and what happens is your central vision is the first one that goes away at the first side of the disease and even before the disease develops, there is this early pathological hallmarks called ruse in the develop but over time there is progressive loss of central vision and then basically it leads to irreversible blindness and 54% of all the blindness in the United States is because of age-related macular degeneration. I think that's remarkable in a very important area of study here and I know just being able to work on a condition like age-related macular degeneration, other forms of vision loss can be inherently motivating because it has the potential to have a big impact on people's lives but let's take a moment to talk about motivation. I think for me at least having a little quote or a saying or something mantra in my mind as I'm going through a tough day can really be helpful. So for our listeners out there who might need a spark of motivation, do you have a favorite quote or a saying that really resonates with you? There are a lot of tough times so I'm always trying to drive myself to go past things so I tell myself tough times don't last tough people do that's my favorite one. The other thing I keep telling myself is this too shut-ass every time I have a difficult. So I know becoming a tough person isn't easy and I think oftentimes mentors, role models, people you meet throughout your life in your career can kind of help shape you help you build that thick skin. So Routina when you look back at your own career in your own life are there particular people who rise to the top of your mind as people who really had an impact on you. Yes so actually my PhD advisor Dr. Phylline Vanueman she's probably why I'm in science and she was the most determined, focused and careful scientist ever known. She once said to me I don't do anything I cannot give 100% to and when I was a graduate student I did not like that at all. Now that I look back to it I think that's the best advice I've ever gotten is that if you really want to do something you want to give it your best and I think she taught me the rigor and respect for science so I'll always be grateful for that. Definitely I think in science the pressure can be high in this feeling of having to give 100% everything can be difficult when you feel like you're juggling just a lot of things so how do you balance that Routina? I learned this again from another mentor not mentor I actually met this lady once in my life but she told me that your life outside work is as important and no matter what 530 to 730 of my day is always belongs to my kids I make it a priority to be with them and I think no matter what happens how bad the day is whatever it is just being with them makes it what fine at the end of the day. Definitely I think setting those boundaries and being firm on them is difficult but it can really make a difference in your life when it's so easy I think for science to just swallow up all of your time. Exactly. Well let's talk about your journey then next Routina can you share with us how you first got interested in science and even started on this pathway? So I did not take a traditional route to science at all so my father was a doctor in India we were three kids growing up my brother my sister and me both my older siblings had not decided to pursue science at all so my dad was hoping I would be the doctor the first chance I got to be out of it I decided I'm going to lead biology so it was 1995 and I was in high school and there was this new praise about computer science and my school had come up with you could leave biology and choose computer science as a measure and I was like okay great I'm doing this so I don't have biology anymore I don't have the pressure from the family anymore I was pretty happy with it but then the same very same year I actually got hit by a bus I came under a bus I had a major accident and I was in the hospital for several months and I saw a lot of people suffer through it I was lucky that my dad had the resources and one of his close friends with a surgeon who saved my leg and I honestly you know at that point when I was in the hospital I was I really wanted to go back to science but I was in India and in India it's not a norm to change your profession and I did not know what to do so I continued with computer science and I became a computer science engineer and did make computer science engineering from a pretty mediocre college in India and all my friends were moving to the United States to do their masters in computer science somewhere getting married so I just followed the direction and I came to the US to do my masters in computer science at Cancer State University and I was trying to make some money on the site so that's how I met my case supervisor I was designing her webpage and they were working on hearing loss in a mouse module and I would keep asking them questions about how do you do this and how do you do that and I was very intrigued by all the research around me and all the neat equipment and experiments that the people were doing that I had no idea that you could actually be involved in all of this and one day out of the blue doctor Langham and asked me if I wanted to be more involved in the research in the lab and I told her of course but I have no background in biology so she gave me a few bucks and she said start reading and come up with the project idea she would ask me questions about what I was reading and stuff and I truly enjoyed it and so she once told me you need to present to the lab about gap junctions so that was the first presentation I did about gap junctions and I truly enjoyed it and at the end of the presentation she came up to me and she said have you thought of science as a career I was pleasantly very surprised but I did not believe that this was possible with my background but under her mentorship I took several prerequisite undergraduate courses and then I got enrolled in PhD in a program in physiology and drafted completing that I moved to Yale School of Medicine to do my postdoc in pharmacology where my focus was diabetic neuropathy and again at that time I got married and I had to move to my Wisconsin medicine and I quickly found the lab of Dr. David Gam who's a Red Nut Lineshine who works on patient derives stem cell models of red note diseases and that's where I started working on stem cells in the eye and finished three years of my postdoc with him and moved to Rochester in 2014 as an assistant professor of ophthalmology and now I have been here for 10 years still working on eye and stem cells well vichita you have an amazing story and I'm very curious I think a lot of science has moved towards more computational and mathematic approaches do you find that having this background in computer science has actually maybe made you a better scientist I feel like I'd look at things a little differently than if I was a hardcore trained biologist I don't necessarily as much use computational tools anymore in my research but I do know where to find those resources so then you mentioned you've been there now at the University of Rochester for some time your lab is doing some really cool work and I'd love to dive into the details of one of your projects so is there one ongoing at the moment Richita that you were just the most excited about and want to share with us today yes so my laboratory uses several different models to study retinal degenerative diseases or eye diseases and we do imaging on patient red note and we use patient derives stem cells and we use animal models when available to study the mechanisms the one project that I'm truly enthusiastic about right now is actually on batten disease which is caused by mutations and CLM-3 this gene this is a neurological disorder but there is vision loss and surprisingly clinically the first symptom that precedes neurological symptoms by several years can be vision loss so when I started working on this disease the consensus in the field was that vision loss and batten disease is because the neurons in the retina are getting lost just like the neurons everywhere in the brain I remember the first time I looked at a post-mortem tissue of this disease I was stuck by the changes I saw in a non-neuronal cell type the retinal pigment epithelium given what I knew about the retinal and how the retinal functions and the importance of this particular cell type for retinal cell health I was like we need to study this non-neuronal cell type in this neurological disorder to understand why vision loss is happening since then we've published that retinal pigment epithelium function specifically if parasiteosis of shed out to segments which is an essential function for photoreceptor or light sensing photoreceptor cells their health is impaired in CLM-3 batten disease and now we are using stem cell models and a large animal model of CLM-3 disease to investigate exactly how RPE cell loss or retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction is contributing to vision loss and CLM-3 disease and perhaps this can actually lead to development of rational therapies targeting the only vision loss in this debilitating blinding disease very interesting and for folks out there who might not have heard of batten disease can you just briefly describe what that might look like it's a group of sodas right so I study batten disease which is caused by mutations in CLM-3 disease so there's several different forms of it and these are basically lysis almost storage disorders they affect mostly young kids and they lead to neurological dysfunction and in a lot of these diseases vision loss is the first phenotype but ultimately over time there's a lot of neurological impairment and ultimately the most common form the one that I study the CLM-3 disease a lot of people live up to their mid 20s or 30s and it's a fatal early onset childhood neurodegenerative disorders it's one of the diseases that I am most invested in studying and I want to understand how it happens and if I can make a difference absolutely and I think that the work that you're doing to better understand the mechanisms could really potentially pave the way for new therapies because it sounds like there aren't currently therapies to really address this debilitating and fatal condition no there are no this is indeed a very important area of research and there are right now a few people that are trying some clinical trials and like there's some therapeutic avenues but there is very limited understanding of how the disease happens now there is avenues for gene therapy and stuff that is still again not out there for CLM-3 disease yet but understanding how the disease develops is very important for developing rational therapies well that makes sense and I appreciate you sharing one of these exciting research projects that you're working on in your lab and I think doing this kind of research can have its ups and downs and I think in science there are a lot of downs a lot of failures a lot of struggles that you have to work through to kind of get to these big breakthrough discoveries so do you have an example of a time where you really struggled with something or perhaps you had a major failure in science and if so could you maybe walk us through how you got through that tough time yeah I don't know if it was a major failure in science but getting my first R1 which are these prestigious national institute of health grants that are deemed to be very very important for getting funding and as a success metric in academia was a total great man I was getting a lot of recognition and funding from private foundations but they're not as substantial as an ice funding and I was finding it very difficult to convince the NIH study section reviewers that the model system that I was proposing to use which is patient derived stem cells was a good platform to study retinal diseases like age related macular degeneration and this was very challenging I submitted that grant several times and I kept getting the same feedback this is an age-mated disease this cannot be studied in a cell culture model you need an animal model to study this disease and at that point my choices were either that I just switched the focus of what I was doing or I showcase why this model can be used and luckily for me we looked looked and we were able to figure out that in the stem cell derived model when you have patient derived cells you can mimic key aspects of the human disease pathology like drusem that had not been able to be done in an in-we war and an animal model previously so we published a paper in P&A and that opened the door for this line of investigation and for my R1 to get funded but it was a very stressful time but I had to make sure that I kept working on it to get that convincing data to open up people's thought process on being able to use patient derived stem cells as a relevant model system I think that perseverance paid off it sounds like and for you I mean there has to be moments during all of this where perhaps you question whether this model is actually the best choice were there those moments for you were there moments where you thought about giving up and maybe pivoting to those animal models or pivoting to a different area altogether of course because it is very important to have funding to support your work and a lot of science requires money to be able to do what you're trying to do and I was like yes I really want to do this but if I don't have the funding to do this there's no way out this is going to be possible so I was actually thinking about yes moving into an animal model but I was never convinced that in isolation an animal model would be sufficient to study a human specific disease and now coming back a circle we've come to a place where we use both stem cell derived models and animal models together as complementary approaches because there are aspects of things for example toxicity that you can only test an animal model where the whole complexity for living being is there right so we now integrated them but as a starting point I'm still glad that we started with using patient derived sounds because I think that gave us some important insights into the disease mechanism that we would not have gotten otherwise definitely and it sounds like this challenge had a happy ending you did ultimately get funding which I think is wonderful and I love to celebrate these success stories in science because I think often there's so much work and difficulty getting to that point of success so is there another success story like to highlight from your career Regina whether it was a big success or even just a small but particularly meaningful one for you yes again like coming back to this whole animal model and stem cell pain right so as I said when I embarked on studying the molecular basis of atrial age macular degeneration I tried to use the patient derived cell model and I had a lot of challenges in trying to convince people that the human cell model although it is a cell model is an important model to study the disease my rational was very simple my rational was like my stone developed the disease you cannot study a disease in a model system that does not develop the disease associated pathology and I agree that patient derived cells are not in vivo and they cannot capture the complexity of the human disease and a cell culture model but I was really wanting to post you using a human cell model to study macular degeneration and interestingly when we were dissecting the process of how this is happening we were able to as I said capture the only pathological hallmark of atrial age macular degeneration and then dish the druzendiposits we were then trying to figure out how were these druzendiposits forming in the patient derived cell models and we discovered then an enzyme that is crucial for druzend formation in the human cell model is actually not functional or is functionally absent in certain strains of mice that have been routinely utilized to develop animal models of macular degeneration and this told us that maybe this is why mice don't develop macular degeneration so being able to link that the protein that is playing an important role in my patient derived human cell model for developing the human disease phenotype is actually not present in the mouse models that are being used to study macular degeneration to me was a very big when I was like okay finally I have convinced myself as to why this approach was needed and now we have understanding of likely why mouse models of macular degeneration do not develop the human pathology I think that is fascinating I think these aha moments in science are sort of rare in a scientist career but it sounds like this one was a clear moment where you saw all right this is what's happening this is the mechanism behind it and this is clearly absent in mice so how did you celebrate this big breakthrough I think a lot of people in my lab were just so excited that this was indeed true and just been out and we celebrated had lunch and I think we still keep talking about it we like oh wow so we were able to link the stem cell model and figure out why maybe it's not happening mice we're still trying to figure that out if that's really true because we're working on the mice to now see if we now introduce the sun's I'm are we able to get the disease so I think the celebration was basically that aha moment and I think not just me the whole lab you were so happy that after all there was a rational for why we use a human cell model definitely and I think celebrating these successes with the group is wonderful because oftentimes there are so many people who contribute to different pieces of these projects over years that kind of culminate in this big moment and I think working in the lab coming to these big breakthroughs can really motivate you to go all in like you said you just want to keep talking about it and kind of figuring out these next steps and next pieces of it but we like to encourage our listeners to take a break to expand their minds and to read broadly so we love talking about book recommendations so Routier do you have a favorite book that you'd like to recommend to all of us whether it's related to science or not so I actually don't read a lot of books and science I read a lot of publications that are way focused on the age of research I do but I was a very average reader growing up and the books that I like are again I don't know if that's a good recommendation for this show but I grew up in India and one of my favorite books is Malgudi Days it's actually a collection of short stories in a small Indian town and it basically captures the spirit of life and relationships and its complexity but it also has a deeper sense or deeper meaning that actions of most people ultimately have a well-meaning purpose and it's a very funny book but it has a very strong implications in terms of life and relationships and our understanding of it I truly didn't enjoy that book well this is a wonderful recommendation well this news we will add this to our book list on our website for everybody and this is a wonderful recommendation and I think as a scientist we've highlighted that throughout your career you've actually traveled quite a bit even just at these different career stages that you've gone through from India to the United States at various institutions and I think as a scientist travel is a big part of life whether it's forework in these changing positions along your career trajectory or for conferences working with collaborators so Ruchita do you have a favorite place that your science has taken you over the years? I don't know if I gained very much scientifically from this particular trip because again these same conferences happen in different locations but the favorite place that ever been to has been Gold Coast Australia it was just refreshing with all the beaches I really enjoyed the fresh bread and cookies and it was the first time I got to hold a koala oh I think it was just memorable well that sounds wonderful what was the occasion that brought you to Australia was it a conference? It was a conference yeah I hate traveling so I never traveled unless I have to go for a conference what did the conference go well? Yeah I mean I truly enjoy conferences because you learn so much about what people are doing what's groundbreaking what's going to be coming up soon what new approaches so I really enjoy going to scientific conferences I wish I didn't have to travel to do that were there particular things that you saw or did in addition to holding koalists sing these beatjust that really made the trip particularly memorable? I find water very relaxing and just being able to be there and observe and again like it was just how nice people were how accommodating to tourists like me and how genuine the whole place was the times that I was nodded the conference I was probably just sitting somewhere and watching water and it was just very beautiful and nature has this very calming and relaxing effect on me well I think that sounds amazing and nice and serene which I think is good sort of a break from the chaos of a conference yes and I know over the course of our conversation we've talked about some of your lab members and mentors and folks that you've interacted with over the course of your career and I think these people are what makes science great I think oftentimes unfortunately scientists are portrayed a certain way in the media with their sort of stiff white lab coats and very serious demeanors but I think so many people I've met in science are these funny fun amazing people so do you have an example that showcases this human side of science regita whether it was a quirky tradition or a funny memory or something else from the lab that you've experienced I talked about a funny experience in a second but I think over the years I've learned that a lot of people that I've worked with in the lab have been very very helpful in terms of every time I've joined a new lab or been in a new place the human side of it right there being times and people have had to take up a lot of time away from what they were doing to be able to teach me something new and I've always appreciated how throughout my career people have taken that time to invest in me without any expectation of what they will get back so to me I feel like scientists as a group right we are very motivated by finding what we need for improvement of maybe the health or whatever like we are motivated to find the cellular mechanism the cure the whatever and we work as a group and we are like very very invested and appreciative of each other's effort and we go beyond in every lab I can probably count two or three people that were very instrumental in being able to publish or achieve or learn anything so having said that my funniest memory in science is actually gross and I'm not going to name the lab or person that was involved but a colleague of mine was holding a mice in her hand and she was trying to point out some important detail about the experiment we were doing and when she was so in gross and figuring this out that the next thing we knew the mice had beaten them out oh no it felt bad for her but now when I look back at it and that's what on the memories I cannot forget and I'm like oh my gosh she was so invested in it it just shows the mishaps I think they're going to happen in lab sometimes too well I think some of these traits that you highlighted as well this generosity this solidarity I think that I've seen in science as well and I think like you said it is this sort of group working together towards these big picture goals and I think your lab is working towards a really important big picture goal as well with finding out the mechanisms and then perhaps ultimately working towards cures for some of these eye diseases so if we were to take away the things that normally hold you back routine or whether that's funding staff technology time feasibility of projects whatever the case may be and you could do anything it doesn't even necessarily have to be in your field of research currently but do you have one question that you would want to answer most I do so as I said I'm like really invested in lies of some more storage disorders because they seem to be affecting young kids so understanding why neurons degenerate in these lies of normal storage disorders like bad indices right now we just studied the sealant bad indices caused due to mutations in CLM 3 gene if I could have my way I would just put my whole lab to stent in the different forms of bad indices and other lies of normal disorders and trying to understand if there is parallels or interconnected pathways or how in these umbrella diseases how is vision loss occurring and understanding vision loss I think will have broader applicability just than vision because it will help us understand in a broader context how the disease is developing and how neurons are getting to degenerate so I think if I could have it my way then I would just put all the resources I have use human imaging, use stem cells, use animal models everything together to study as much about lies of normal storage disorders as I could well this sounds amazing I love this idea of being able to go all in if there were no barriers I think this is a tremendously important area of research and we appreciate the work that you're doing in this area and I think to be able to do amazing work and science sometimes you need that key piece of advice at that right moment along your career pathway so for listeners out there who might get a fork in the road or just working their way through their own journeys do you have a piece of advice that you could share with you that really helped you along your own I mentioned one of it already my PhD advisor had told me that give 100% to whatever you do but I think one piece of advice that again I can maybe kind of briefly mention it was that I met this professor when the name Dr. Reusley Krauch and I only met her once and she has had a great influence on me as a scientist she'd done some really awe-inspiring work on improving our understanding of retinal biochemistry and stuff but when I met her I was actually interviewing for a faculty position and I asked her is that a piece of advice you're so successful and she said there's one thing you can do right is try to find time to do something other than science and she said if you have kids for example with her she mentioned that she always found time for her kids every day and she made it to points to even them for dinner and before bed even if that meant she had to go back to work and I think I took it to heart and at that moment that she told me this I did not have kids I was struggling with infertility but when I did have kids I always try to take time away from science because sometimes when you step back you think better and at the end of the day is my de-stressal but I think the important thing is to be able to not just make that the only focus of your life and have something else to lean back on. Definitely and I think this advice can mean so much when you're getting it from someone who's been through it who has been successful in the career and gives you permission to feel like you can stop at the end of the day and take that breath and take that moment with your kids. I think it's absolutely important. Well we appreciate you sharing that advice in Ritina is there any other last piece of advice from you or maybe a last piece of inspiration that you'd like to leave listeners with at the end of our conversation today? What I've learned from my journey this far is to learn from people around you and I think what benefited the most has been from seeing how my mentors and other successful scientists approach science and the effort that they put into finding answers and there's no shortcut. It takes a really extensive time it takes a lot of investigation it takes a lot of work and I said before that the two very different outlooks inspiration that I formed the framework of my life have been one was my PhD advisor's outlook is to always give 100% everything you do and the second one was Dr Rosalie Krause's advice that you need to find time to do something away from science every day in my case it's my kids. So also prioritizing life outside of work is important. Definitely I think when you're at work you give 100% to work and when you're at home you give 100% to home and I love that balance that you've established for yourself. Yes and time yourself I'm not going to be that one. Well we appreciate you sharing this message with all of us today if our listeners would like to learn more about you Regina and the work that you're doing what is the best way for them to do so. You can go to PubMed and you can search my name Richard O'Sing and but I have a very common name so you might have to search for Richard O'Sing and Rochester on PubMed.gov you can go to my labs website at the University of Rochester and if you really need to reach me on have a specific question you can reach me via email and that's again listed on my website. Perfect we appreciate you sharing those resources listeners definitely take a moment to learn more about Ruchita learn more about the amazing work that she and her lab members are doing and Ruchita it's been such a pleasure to have you on the show today thank you so much for your time. Of course yeah no thank you so much for having me and I am truly grateful for the listeners who would be listening to my experience outside the science and if anybody has any questions or would like to reach out to me please feel free to email me or check out more of my work at PubMed and so. Perfect well thank you again for your time and listeners we were delighted to have you here with us as well we hope you'll join us again next time for another episode of people behind the science.
