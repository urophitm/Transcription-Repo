Good afternoon. Good evening. Good morning to wherever you may happen to be. This is another episode of Seti live and in keeping with the season I have up the contrast of the lighting here on me So I look even more sinister than normal and our guest today who is dressed like a human pumpkin is also undoubtedly going to be looking a little bit sinister as he discusses The question of our ultimate end at the hands of the universe Now you might wonder what do I mean by that? Well look you look up at the night sky and You see the stars the moon it all looks very serene Very romantic captain Kirk can't wait to get out there and have some adventures But the facts are that the universe is Implacably hostile it's a dangerous place and our guest Dr. Phil plate Has written a book about this called death from the skies and that sounds a little unfortunate But we're going to talk about it and whether you should indeed up the premium on your insurance policy My name is Seth Schostek. I'm senior astronomer here at this setty institute and Phil plate Thanks for joining us and how are you doing? Hey Seth good to see you again Well, well it is death from this guy's now that that book goes back a little bit. It's more than a dust Yes, it is back a bit. There you are Had one ready. Oh look that's nice by this guy look at that Bill plate I'll play peach. Okay now let me just ask you. I mean this is kind of an unfortunate topic I mean it's appropriate out or a Halloween But why did you write about death from the skies rather than about you know? I don't know the abundances of rare earth elements and cool stars or something like that Well because you know an actual book publisher didn't want me to write an astrophysical journal paper and the astrophysical journal Wouldn't publish death from the sky so I figured hey, you know do what you got to do In fact, I've always liked disaster movies Erwin Allen for those of you who are like really bring it off my one that age all these over-the-top disaster movies growing up and I still love them now I love astronomy. I studied stars that explode several times actually over the years and Just became fascinating it was sort of merging these two things together and the idea of what sort of astronomical events could If not wipe out life on earth or destroy the earth completely at least put the hurt on us as the species Okay, by the way Erwin Allen he made amongst many other films the Poseidon adventure It's I recall about a cruise ship that flips you know it it goes turtle and with the hull up in the in the passengers all down That kind of an interesting premise and I have avoided cruise ships ever since all right now look let's let's get started on something That's very old for wrong something that's in the news today and that is the Sun the Sun seems to be acting up Yeah, the Sun goes through cycles About every 11 years and it has a Magnetic field associated with it and the way it generates a magnetic field is complicated But they're sort of bubbles of hot gas that rise and fall inside the Sun They bring their magnetic fields with them when when they reach the surface These magnetic fields could get tangled up and they snap there's a huge amount of energy stored in these things And when they snap that energy is released and you can get what's called a solar flare well The minimum of this cycle was just last a couple of years ago actually it ended last year So we're now on the ramp up the Sun's magnetic magnetic activity starting to ramp up again And we've seen a few Sun spots and sure enough It's been flaring a little bit lately and then this morning I got a notice actually friend of mine texted me and said what's the Sun hearing about a flare and it's like yeah the Sun had a relatively Powerful flare and I can I can let's see screen share and I can do this and then do that and then instead of me Hopefully you'll see you see the Sun there we do Ah, there you go and I hope you don't see my desktop. I probably got like bills to pay and stuff um, but this is an image of the Sun taken by the solar dynamics of the territory Which is orbiting it would out in space and this is a visible light image and you can see that there are Sun spots in it And then this is an image taken in the far ultraviolet which is where you see much more energetic events And yeah that thing down there at the bottom center that is the Sun spot that tangled up Released its energy and kaboom released a big old flare that was very exciting well, but that it's a dramatic photo too But you know, okay, so the Sun has a bit of if you will acne today But the Sun is 93 million miles away from downtown mountain view here. Why do I tear how does this affect me the car buyer In general when the Sun has some sort of solar storm as we call it space it generates space weather It blasts off subatomic particles and a lot of high energy light x-ray light sometimes even gamma ray and this is This material can then interact with the earth and there are various ways it does that it can interact with our magnetic field It can interact with our atmosphere It if the energy pulse is big enough it can actually Effect satellites it can short them out so you can lose these billion dollar assets many of which are very important It also makes a lot of radio noise and your radio astronomer set uh, I was gonna say steady. There you go Uh, you can't spell I guess steady without Seth Shostak in an extra eye Yeah, I think that's right. I could use an extra eye. Yeah So this thing can create a lot of radio noise It can affect the way we communicate there can be blackouts with satellites It can actually interact with the earth's power grid the the especially in North America The the grid that distributes electricity throughout our country and even in Canada This can be overloaded you get a huge surge of electricity in the earth's crust This happened in 1989 in Quebec caused a power outage And that was um Decent size storm, but there have been much much bigger ones in the past In fact solar weather the space weather idea It was first seen in 1859 And that was still the most powerful storm in the modern age if we were to have a storm like that today Aimed at the earth yeah, we'd see power outages satellites lost all kinds of problems So yeah, this affects you even in mountain view Uh, well, I was gonna say I fortunately I have a lot of you know uh, uh double a batteries around here I just wonder is this a modern I mean, particularly it sounds like this is a modern problem It's not a problem that would have affected you know the Victorians in the 19th century because they didn't have satellite assets Yes, there was a little bit of power distribution, but not very much This this is a if you will a vulnerability that we've kind of incurred by our own actions That is um mostly correct. Yeah, I mean there was a small effect if in the 1859 event for example there were telegraphs And they could run them without batteries. There was so much electricity surging through the wires of these things generated by the sun That they were able to use telegraphs without Without actually having to charge them up and there have been some severe storms In 993 AD 993 774 774 there was the biggest solar storm in 10,000 years that physically affected our atmosphere generated carbon 14 and and brilliant 10 I believe these elements which we can now find and you can see the effects On tree rings and that's how we were able to get the dates of these things So this actually affected biology on earth and it's not like mutations and and that sort of thing You yeah, I don't think the sun could do that, but these are very powerful storms and yes I mean the the fact of the matter is we have a power grid right now and because the sun Generates so can generate electricity in the earth that electricity can affect our grid and when the grid was built They said you know what we're gonna we're gonna overbuild this thing So in case that we need more power later will be fine. It's like that was great But still over time we have loaded this thing up So now with power lines carrying about as much much electricity as they can if you double or triple that Yeah, these these wires are gonna they're gonna heat up. They're gonna break and you're gonna cause power outages Okay, so what if Elon Musk you know sells me a ticket to go to Mars 10 years from now, right? And it takes me seven months in that rocket I hope I don't get a middle seat to go to Mars and one of these solar storms you ruffs. Do I care? Well, I think you're gonna want a middle seat because there even an An aisle seat to have as much meat between you and the window is possible Because yeah, this is a flood of radioactive part and not radioactive pardon me of of Subatonic particles that will sweep through the ship and that includes Fast neutrons which are bad. It could involve x-rays which are bad Fast electrons which are bad these can interact with our bodies Our damage our DNA cause cell damage So it's not a good thing and if you want to take a six to nine month trip to Mars You better make sure that your ship is protected. There was actually a study that just came out. I just wrote about this showing sort of Modeled human beings is sort of a ball of meat. It's just a way to do it Physically to make it easier and and how much sort of water you need outside of you to protect you because it turns out water is really good at absorbing these particles You'd say, well, why don't we use lead right lead protects us for it's like let us the worst thing to use Because of the way these particles interact with metal you want something like wait like hydrogen water has a lot of hydrogen in it You could put water in your hull of your ship and that acts like radiation shield and you need you know This much or so to protect you from normal radiation So hopefully they're designing their ships to do something like that We're talking with Dr. Phil plate Also known as the bad astronomer not because he's a bad astronomer But because he talks about bad astronomy On occasion and you know things that people believe that actually aren't quite so true Okay, so the Sun could cause inconvenience death to some people inconvenience to a lot of people What are what about well what everybody points to is the number one threat from the skies Namely an arant asteroid that you know clenches earthward and does to us what one did did the dinosaurs a scant 66 million years ago Well the good news is and I always have to start off this way is that we don't know of Any large asteroid heading our way for at least the next century And I want to be careful here because that doesn't mean there's not one out there It just means that we don't know of any but on the other hand We have mapped a lot of these things we know where most of these things are the odds of us getting wiped out like the dinosaurs Extremely extremely low But it doesn't take something Six miles wide You know carving a hole 150 miles across and then the Gulf of Mexico like like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs Doesn't take that to hurt us Just a few years ago an asteroid that was about 60 feet I was have to convert from metric it was 19 meters so 60 feet across Came in over a town called Chelliavinska town a city of a million people in Russia and exploded With the equivalent of a half a megaton bomb And this The shockwave shattered windows that injured over a thousand people if this thing had been five times bigger I would have done a huge amount of damage if it had if it had come down at a different angle This one came in at a shallow angle if it had come in straight down The explosion had generated would have been extremely bad it would have killed a lot of folks So this is a threat that we take seriously in astronomy and is anybody doing anything about it I know that it took a long time to get Congress to appropriate any money to NASA to even categorize you know the threat right Yeah, it's it was sort of a problem that NASA wasn't really pushing it very hard And then when you try to talk to Congress about it and they're like what like that movie Armageddon and you're like Well, no Actually nothing like Armageddon which got everything wrong But in fact, you know, this is this is a serious threat It's hard It's hard to describe this in terms that either don't downplay it or exaggerate it I don't want to say you know The sky is raining fire On the other hand, this is something when people ask me what are the odds of an impact Doing some damage to us and I say 100% if we do nothing and we wait long enough. It's a hundred percent If you're talking about in the next five years the odds are much lower because these are rare events and also There is something we can do about this We've actually slammed a space probe into a comet. It's called the deep space Excuse me the deep impact probe in 2005 hit a small comet. This was a test to see if we could do it NASA's planning another one called the double asteroid redirect And of course now that I'm sitting here. What does the T stand for it's called dart and it's it's launching soon and it's going to head up to An asteroid actually a double asteroid an asteroid with a moon and it's going to hit the moon Impact it really hard and then see how much the moon's trajectory changes And that's going to tell us how hard we have to hit an asteroid the idea being that this thing is often space It's going to hit us in 20 years. We see something that maybe it's going to hit us in 20 years If we move it a little bit now Then by the time the impact would have occurred it would miss us It's a little bit like crossing the street if you see a car that's way way far away you can cross the street slowly But if it's really close you got a hustle or you know, maybe not even cross the street in first place So in this in the sense what we want to do is push the asteroid out of the way as early as possible So that we don't have to use very much force and then over the years It'll drift off that trajectory and mishaps Okay, so that's a threat from the skies That's Threatening us with death on the skies That we know about but we can do something about it You know when you're writing your book death from the skies What was the if you will the most intriguing threat? I mean people do know about asteroids They've seen Bruce Willis do something about them But what's the threat that most people don't heard about which could be in fact serious Well, the two biggest ones that that register on my scale at least would be a solar storm because we know those happen And if one happened now it would be a problem In fact in 2012 there was an enormous Explosion on the Sun, but it missed us It was aimed in a slightly different direction and didn't hit us if that had been aimed at us We wouldn't be talking about it right now because we wouldn't have an internet Oh, no But And so that's going to happen that's something we need to deal with and we can there's also the asteroid impact like you said And that is also maybe something we can deal with At that point the odds of Actually anything hurting us dropped significantly Depending on your timescale if you're talking about well 10 billion years then then all sorts of things become possible like the Sun turning into a red giant and engulfing the earth Possibly another star passing close enough to the to the solar system to drop comets in This is something that maybe has happened in the past that as the Sun is moving around the galaxy Another star passes near enough. There are all these rocky icy objects out past Neptune They're just orbiting the Sun very slowly But the gravity of that star could disturb them and drop them into the inner solar system Now it's not like you would see them like striding stars or anything like that You're still talking about one impact every you know some thousands of years But that is something you wouldn't want to have happened happily Long time in the future People always worry about black holes But I have to say Of all the things out there The one that that intrigues me I think that's an interesting word that you would say would be what's called a magnetar And these are neutron stars these are extremely dense cores of stars that have blown up the star explodes the core collapses And you take basically one or two times the mass of the Sun and squeeze it down into a ball that's like 12 or 15 miles across These are incredibly dense objects with very strong magnetic fields They sometimes can erupt similar to way the Sun does but you know a gazillion times bigger You have the same sort of effects it can interact with our magnetic field interact with our atmosphere And even though these things can be thousands of light years away they can still have an effect on us and in 2004 Yeah 2004 there was one that was half a galaxy away it was halfway across our galaxy and it erupted And it was the effects were felt in our atmosphere and in the Earth's magnetosphere It actually pegged the needle on a lot of telescopes that are orbiting The Earth an x-ray telescope so many so many x-rays basically hit these things that they they freaked out So this is this is um I don't know if raises this isn't something I'll I awake at night worrying about right? This is a very rare event and even one you know the one that affected us was still Barely detectable on Earth it wasn't a profound effect here But it is interesting that that something so far away can actually physically affect us I want to follow up on that in a moment But but first I'd like to follow up by telling you that we're talking with Phil plate and you are in Yeah But I hope you're gratified by the opportunity and I like to say where you are Are in places of exotic locations like Florida, California the UK, Georgia, Chicago, Ohio and Croatia Sing a load of Croatia. I mean, that's that's not an exactly next door And by the way, this is being brought to you via the seti institute You know that you want to learn more about the seti institute just go to our website that's seti.org And I might also point out to you something that's obvious to us if not to you And that is all these activities are funded by donations from people like you as NPR likes to say So go to the website check it out seti.org Back to Phil okay, you were talking about death on the skies But from somebody else in skies as it were I mean that something halfway across the galaxy You know, and that maybe as far away as the the center of our galaxy could still conceivably have an effect on the earth What about these so-called Gamma yeah gamma ray bursts these are you know explosive events they don't seem to happen terribly often but they can have a Really unfortunate action at a distance right are these dangerous Are they dangerous? Yes, they're terrifying Um and again, I will start with a caveat and say that as far as we know There is no potential Pregenitor for a gamma ray burst anywhere close enough to earth to hurt us um, but these are These are terrifying events in that they are extremely energetic. They're affiliated with um stars that explode They're they're coupled with different kinds one is one of star massive star like say beetle juice explodes It's some of this energy under certain circumstances instead of just going out in all directions Can actually be focused into these beams that then march across the universe And there's so much energy in these beams and they're focused so well That we can see this is clear across the observable universe So we're talking about seeing some of these things billions of light years away now. They're they're pretty faint Um on the other hand, there have been a few that if you were looking at the right direction at the right time There would have been enough light to actually see it with your naked eye you would have seen this bloop of light It sort of got bright and and dimmed again Um, but these are events they don't take very long usually a few seconds up to a couple of minutes Um, but there's a vast amount of energy stored in them Now you can do the math and say well if they have this much energy and they're this far away How close would they have to be to earth before they start to really uh, really affect us And the answer depends on a lot of stuff but in general 10,000 light years maybe so if there were one in our galaxy there was a decent chance That if we're if it were aimed at us Yeah, I could hurt us it could um again affect our magnetic field change the chemistry in our atmosphere And if one were really close enough to us well, it could it could generate the planet I mean these does a huge amount of energy in these things But if they were sort of maybe closer than 10,000 light years but not right on top of us Not enough to like light a match on our planet um The the high energy particles from this explosive event Could convert the nitrogen in our atmosphere to nitrous oxide which is basically small. It's a thick stinky red Uh Gas and it can hang in the air and actually Lower the temperature of the earth the stuff is so dark and there were enough of it generated it would block the sun And enough that the earth could freeze which is weird you think oh we're getting hit with all this energy You think it would cook us but in fact it could cause uh an effect similar in nuclear winter and and that's like that's like the best thing that can happen There are much much worse things that it can do but Depending on how close it is it could cause power outages white spirit power outages the high energy Pulse of subatomic particles could irradiate people on the side of the planet facing there. It's uh, it's awful But again the good news Although there are a couple of stars in our galaxy that we think are capable of the of this They're either far enough away from us or Remember these things are focused into beans if that being misses us We don't suffer the effects and we think that the the ones that are possible of doing this in our galaxy are in named data So we're probably okay Okay, well that's gonna bring me to my last question But we do hope that you in the audience will you know post some questions we can pass them on to fill here I might say we picked up some uh viewers in michigan, New York, Spain and Missouri So uh, you know Michigan have you ever been to michigan? I went to the university of michigan. Okay, so you know, you know, I'm gonna pronounce it Yeah, go michigan. Yeah All right, all right. Well, here's the bottom line for me Phil um There you know, there's a whole laundry list of things that are dangerous in space It isn't a benign lovely, you know environment, but it also has to be said that we've had life on this planet for four billion years And it hasn't been stopped not once in you know the last four billion years whatever So doesn't that suggest that yeah, it's apt to get you but it probably won't That's exactly right and this is something I hammer home a lot when I talk about this kind of thing There are a lot of people out there who get really scared of this stuff and um, I think that that can be healthy But sometimes it becomes an anxiety that keeps them up at night. There's even a word for this Cosmophobia fear of the universe fear of space um, but the fact of the matter is Uh, despite all of the stuff going on around us you're right I mean, there's been life on this planet for at least three billion years if not four As far as we know it's never been wiped out. So basically scrubbing the earth clean sterilizing it is a very hard thing to do uh on the other hand We do know that the occasional asteroid impact the occasional solar storm has changed things on earth But we're talking about a timescale Um of hundreds of thousands if not millions of years if not billions of years So for a couple of these things solar storms asteroid impacts It's worth thinking about it's worth saying to ourselves how do we prevent these things or how do we mitigate them? How do we Defend against them on earth um, but for all these other things Not a worry and that's why I literally wrote the book on this because it's fun to think about them You can learn about black holes and neutron stars You can kind of get that thrill of being in a in an end of the world movie without having to actually be terrified of looking at your window at night Okay, well we have some questions we'll get to those uh I just sort of wondered You know what we've sort of concluded on the basis of what you've just said That actually the universe may be out to get you But it isn't running faster than you are and probably won't get you but on the other hand Maybe that's just us right? It certainly got the dinos and you could say if that rock that you know fell in the utheton 66 million years ago had you know arrived 10 minutes later And would have bypassed the earth and you know, we would be having dinosaurs as guests rather than as a host So you know, so maybe this sounds like the entropic principle or something, but maybe we've just been lucky Do you think our experience is typical? You think the universe normally kills its prey? Um, well eventually again, you know if you're talking about timescales of billions of years I think yeah You know if five billion years the sun's gonna cook the earth so that's gonna happen But um as far as humanity is concerned that's a very very long time And it depends on where you are there are places in this galaxy if you if your planet happens to be near a black hole That could be a problem if it's near a massive star that it could explode as a supernova that could be a problem as it is we're in a fairly um the Calm part, you know, we're in the suburbs of the Milky Way galaxy things aren't that bustling here In the universe maybe out to get us, but it's also a little bit lazy. It's taken its time So again, this isn't something I you know, I lie awake at night fretting about yeah, yeah, not like your amx bill or something Let's take a couple of questions here. This is one what would be the fastest way for the universe to kill earth or the sun Wow, that's a good question um the fastest way um Would be something traveling at the speed of light that immediately snuck things out now. I believe you had my friend Katie Macon uh last week and she's written a book called the end of everything which is literally about the end of the universe Uh, and there's this idea that Uh, the universe could go through a phase change which is sort of like when you know, if you melt ice it goes from solid to a liquid You heated up more it goes from liquid to a gas. There's this idea that the universe itself is not quite Uh, uh in a in a calm state it could go through a phase change which would basically wipe everything out at the speed of light So that would be the fastest you wouldn't even know it happens The good news is again the odds of this happening very low um But in in the kind of in the realm of the possible the realm of the more likely um, I'd go with the gamma ray burst if there were nearby gamma ray burst some of these last a fraction of a second But the amount of energy if one were close enough to the earth it would be like you know, igniting hundreds of thousands of nuclear weapons on one side of the earth This side facing it the good news is again, we don't know of anything That close that can do that to us But if it were there and that did happen it'd be fast The same for supernovae. I mean people know about supernovae It's with a you know star runs out of fuel a big star It just blows up and if that stars I don't know five light years away That could strip out you know the I don't I mean the ozone layer and everybody would get instant skinned cancer I suppose But uh, they don't seem to be any big stars that are about to go They're five light years away. That would be pretty bright um Rather than the full moon Yeah, and and that's close enough that you'd have a lot of physical effects A star blowing up actually takes a couple of weeks before it reaches its maximum brightness So that's still pretty rapid on an astronomical scale So you know, you would see this in getting brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter that would be very bad And then there would be all sorts of effects it would it would upset It would dump so much heat on the earth that we would warm up it would destroy our ecology If it were really close I imagine um, you know, it'd be like taking a blowtorch to the planet But it would have to be very close for that But you're right. I mean there could be a huge blast of x-rays or even gamma rays Wipe out our ozone layer it radiate the planet. I mean it's a it's a laundry list of horrifying things that would happen Okay, well, you know that sort of bears on one of these questions that do Underground houses protect us from cosmic rays or some of the other kinds of particles of radiation that could do us in You know should I I guess the the person who's writing that question wants to know whether they should sell Their condo and downtown Boulder and just move into an underground house It depends if they have a basement apartment. I suppose Yeah, in fact being underground would protect you from quite a number of these things If you had your own air supply and electricity and food that would last long enough on the other hand With a gamma ray burst or it's a close enough supernova It's possible that when the high-energy Particles hit our atmosphere they can create a kind of Subatomic particle called a muon and these are very penetrating they can actually pass through solid ground I'm not sure what the depth is I was thinking two meters, but that sounds woefully inadequate. I think it's farther than that So you know if you had a if you had a mountain layer, I suppose if you're in Norrad base. I believe where they keep to stargate if I if I believe my fictional television shows are real um You might be okay, but yeah, it's things like cosmic rays these are again subatomic particles that come from space Uh, and you're exposed to them all the time It's usually not a problem a flood of them would be a problem getting underground would help But I think you'd have to get underground far enough to also protect you from the muons And I suppose you can go online and look up how far you'd have to be deep, but it would be a waste Might be cost prohibitive Okay, well, I think we're getting close to the end here, but uh still another What do you know? Oh, what I guess we're close to the end. Ah, oh wait Yeah, it's in the sky, but I think it's his nautical illusion Uh, we we have some viewers by the way in Brussels in Colombia and in Madeleine so there you go Yeah, here's uh, what would be the fastest way to oh yeah, we've already talked about that um Yeah, this is a question it's more of a technical question, but you know what sort of a radar setup Should we have to inventory or even to well just inventory really All the rocks out there in space that might actually impact the earth and cause great damage Do we even yesterday or that yeah, yeah, you can um most of the asteroids we find are found using Observatories on the ground they they're looking using visible light the kind of light we see and looking for moving things in the sky And there are surveys that do that now and in in a few years are going to be much larger ones Which I'll be able to see much fainter much smaller asteroids I in fact NASA's building um a satellite which will orbit the Sun which will look in infrared And that's even better because these things are warm and they glow in infrared light and that makes it um Easier to figure out how big they are and how dangerous they are If they get close enough to earth we do have radar facilities Which can ping these things with radar that light bounces back and we can get an accurate size and accurate orbit and a shape for these things Um, so all of these things working together Um will be able to map a lot if not the vast majority of the dangerous asteroids Um that could pose a threat to the earth for quite some time Okay, so that helps you to at least know the shape of the bullet But what about a defense against the bullet suppose you know we find something that's on a trajectory to hit earth say Two years from now Anything we can do oh two years not much um, and you know, it depends on how big it is and and it depends on what it's made of for example um in Armageddon and deep impact we blew these things up with nuclear weapons Um that may or may not work what we're finding is a lot of these smaller objects are actually what we call rubble piles They're not solid rock They're actually like a construction site made of rubble smaller rocks. I'll help together by gravity If you try to impact that say with us with a uh a space probe to push it out of the way Most of that energy goes into just absorbing the spacecraft's energy It's like it's like hitting something made of lots of styrofoam You're just jostling the styrofoam around and and it's not really going to push just to sing into a neutral trajectory There have been studies about blowing up nuclear weapons Just off of these things so you basically get close to it blow up the nuclear weapon and what that does is it heats that side of the asteroid up So much that you get a vapor which expands violently that actually like a rocket and pushes the thing out of the way And that actually works decently well for small rocks and by small I mean you know under half a mile in size and the farther in advance We know that these things are going to hit us the better because the less energy it will take to push them out of the way So really this is about Finding them finding them as far in advance as possible If we see one that has our name on it figuring out what it's made of so that we know what to do I think it was Carl Sagan it was some talking was getting a lot of time ago obviously a long time ago uh and which he said you know developing technology To deflect asteroids incoming uh was actually a bad idea Because what he was saying was that look if you develop that technology now The world has technology that it can use to redirect asteroids and some bad guys somewhere Might in fact take a completely innocuous asteroid and redirect it to hit the earth you know Uh Well in an enemy country use it as a weapon. So he thought we should never develop this technology Yeah Certainly that point is valid You know if he if a good person can save the earth a bad person can destroy it and sometimes that person is the same person Um Trying to save the earth or or or whatever might wind up hurting us but um If an asteroid is heading our way and we haven't developed that technology then we're screwed So I think you know if if you have an immediate threat there's in in we know that in 10 years say Something two miles wide is going to impact uh yeah, we better have that technology now the odds of that happening are very low um, but it's This technology is inevitable we have Uh Elon Musk Jeff Bezos we have these folks developing these rockets which eventually Will be able to go out into deep space not just up or down or into orbit but out into the solar system And that's all it takes if you have a rocket that big you have the technology to put an act push an asteroid out of the way So it's gonna happen either way um, I just in at some point you have to hope that uh There's not somebody evil enough and and uh and honestly uh Just I hate to use the word dumb, but uh You can't necessarily control what this thing is gonna do and Something At just the right size to maybe damage a city Uh could have much more wide ranging effects and at some point I think it's just easier to um to threaten people by You know with holding their internet or something like that you'll probably get a lot more done with a lot less effort Well, I admire your optimism about getting a lot more done thanks to the internet. I Hey, yeah, I want to thank you Phil plate for being our guest today as usual It was stimulating interesting and uh yeah a very informative So Phil plate the bad astronomer you want to give your website feel so the people can go find you Well, yeah, it's um you can find me at sci-fi wire.com or sci-fi.com.
