 Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and today we're thinking about the future. Implicitly of course we think about the future a lot on this podcast and elsewhere, but today we're being a bit more upfront about it. There are people who describe themselves and are described by the outside world as professional futurists, whose job it is to predict what will happen down the road. But there's this other genre, which is also very successful called science fiction. Writing fictional narratives that are often set in the future, not necessarily trying to predict exactly what will happen, but at least to imagine different possible futures. This helps us think about how we should approach the future as well as how we should approach the present. When I was a kid I was a big science fiction fan, mostly reading novels but also watching TV and movies. But I can tell you from reading more recent science fiction that the level of sophistication has gone way up. Both the literary quality and also the scientific quality of modern science fiction is as high as it's ever been. In fact on today's podcast I put forward the hypothesis that modern science fiction writers are in some sense the last great generalists. Because not only do you have to understand a lot about science, you also have to understand a lot about humanity. So you need to understand sociology and psychology and you need to be able to write. You need to be able to tell a good story to invoke a vivid world to invent interesting and colorful characters. So our guest today, Anneli Nuitz is absolutely one of those generalists, someone who can think in interesting ways about a wide variety of things. Anneli got her PhD in English and American studies from Berkeley, but then she became a writer specializing in science and technology. She was the founder of the famous blog IO9. She was then the editor in chief of Gismoto and she's right now the editor at large at ours, Technica, where she has a very wide variety of experience writing about both individual technological breakthroughs and also the background science behind these breakthroughs. Recently, Anneli has decided to turn that experience to writing science fiction. She and science fiction writer Charlie Jane Anders actually co-host their own podcast, which recently started. It's called Our Opinions Are Correct, on which Charlie Jane and Anneli discuss the meaning of science fiction. I encourage you to check that out. And in her recent novel called Autonomous, Anneli deals with the biochemistry of pharmaceuticals, the ethics of robotics and artificial intelligence. And my favorite, the economics of what it means to have a right to work. She talks about slavery and indenture and people trying to work in different parts of the world. We take for granted the idea that we're allowed to work, but maybe in the future that won't be the case. This is the kind of speculative scenario that science fiction is perfectly made for. So on the podcast, we'll talk about science, technology, science fiction, the difference between writing fiction and nonfiction, and how we should think about what the future has in store.

And Ily knew it, so welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Yeah, thanks for having me. So I was reading an article in Slate from a few months ago by you. And if I could paraphrase the lesson, it would be that science fiction needs more economics in it. Is that accurate? And do you actually believe that? I actually do believe that. I thought I was very clever for coining the phrase, dismal science fiction, which I probably didn't really coin, but it felt like I did at this time. And to sort of describe this cluster of issues that shows up in some science fiction novels where, and also some fantasy as well, where we kind of see characters grappling with the economic dimensions of what's going on, whether that's space travel and colonizing other worlds, or whether that's getting a grant to study something. Which we almost never see in science fiction. And it consumes the lives of scientists. You know, it's actually like a big part of how you do science. It certainly is. I just for the audience out there read Annalise Wonderful, debut novel Autonomous. And yeah, there's a lot more about being the principal investigator in that novel and applying for grants than I've read in almost any other novel that I can remember. I've gotten a lot of appreciative tweets from graduate students. Oh, at last our labor has been acknowledged. And yeah, I mean, I think that one of the things we talk about a lot as science fiction writers is world building. And how do you make an imaginary world feel lived in and feel real so that your reader partly, so your reader has a fun experience, but also so that it actually inspires people to really rethink reality, which is ultimately what we're writing about since we don't actually travel into the future and report on it. And I think that especially right now, economics are becoming a really important part of how we think about science, how we deal with each other, what's shaping the future. And so, you know, some writers are dealing with this more and more. And also economists are really interested in building scenarios about the future too. So I feel like there's a lot of good opportunities there for us to be thinking about basically thinking about science in context, if that makes sense, like sort of thinking about not just like, hey, we discovered a new particle, but how did that happen? Like, how did this dude get to be the one who discovered this particle out of all the people who were working on the project or like, how did this project get the funding that allowed them to discover the particle? Like, why did this particle accelerator lose its funding? You know, why did this one, even though it has lots of problems, get to keep its funding? You know, there's all these weird questions that sound really wonky, but they're actually part of making a really exciting story because part of what's fun is seeing people struggle to get what they want. And that struggle isn't just shooting particles down an accelerator, although that would be cool if it were. That would be cool, but you're right. It's not exactly what it is. I have to ask before I forget, have you read the famous Paul Krugwoon article about the economics of faster than light travel? I have. Yeah. And that sparked a huge debate. I mean, that was part of a huge debate within the science fiction community and people like Charles Strauss were proposing for a while that we have this kind of ultra realistic science fiction mundane science fiction basically where we were just like not going to have faster than light travel because it was just absurd. And so a few people signed on for that and like, Charlie Strauss wound up getting around it by having teleportation gates in his work and I was like, oh, okay. So we're not going to have faster than light travel, because that's just silly, but teleportation gates, no prop. Well, you know, we have standards for ourselves and say it's for other people. That's okay. But I love this idea about making it realistic and it making the world that you're creating realistic, both in an economic sense as well as a technological sense because after all, economics is an enormous influence on how we live our lives at a very basic level. So it led me to the following conjecture. Are science fiction writers the last great generalists because of all the stuff you have to know? Wow, that's a really interesting question. I mean, I think it's really going to depend on the science fiction writer and also how they view their relationship to science because I think there's definitely science fiction writers out there. Maybe people like David Brinn, for example, who, and I think a lot of kind of writers who've now passed on who are really popular in the 50s and 60s, I think they really thought of themselves as what we would probably today call like a foresight analyst or a futurist. I think they really did not feel like they were generalists who were commenting on the world today, but that they were actually predicting things that would happen based on what they knew of the world, a kind of well-informed prediction. And I think now, yeah, I mean, some science fiction writers for sure are generalists. One of the kind of big breakout new voices in science fiction is Anne Lecky, who won every award in the universe for her Ancillary Justice series. Yeah, I love those. Yeah, they're fantastic. And I mean, she deals with everything. Like she deals with economics, she deals with space travel, she deals with AI, she deals with archaeology. And so I know from talking to her that she is a voracious reader, and like she'll read everything from medieval Chinese novels to the latest articles about discoveries in science. So I think she may be an outlier. There will always be a spectrum, right? I mean, not every science fiction writer cares that much to do the research and think about these things at an academic level, but not only it seems like if you wanted to do a certain kind of writing, not only do you have to catch up on humanity and economics and sociology and political science and technology and physics and biology, but yet to be able to tell a story. So there's the humanities are in there too. So it does strike me that the best equipped science fiction writers are true generalists in the old school sense of the word. Yeah, I think that's right. And it's funny because the novel that I'm writing right now, which won't be out for like a year or so, sorry that I'm kind of teasing at a tiny bit. But it's like autonomous. It has a lot of academics in it, scientists, but also social scientists. And it's a it's set in an alternate timeline where there is a need for science and social science to work hand in hand and basically be in the same academic department. So this is a very kind of narrow fantasy of an alternate history. I don't know if you have some teleportation machines in there. It's much more comfortable. I know there is others time machines. So that's sort of what has to happen right there. You have to have time machines in order to have like an academic department, which is completely integrated social science and science. And physical science, it's geology. So part of what I've been thinking about a lot in this book is where does social science fit into the scientific project. And I promise that the book is actually just mostly people running around in time machines and fighting and stuff. But there's such a lot. It's like one of these law review articles that has three lines of tape at the top and then a hundred lines of footnotes. Small thing. Yeah, there are there there will actually be there will be an afterward with some with some end notes. But it is but there is this kind of like for people like I said, I mean you don't you won't need to go into the novel being like I have some thoughts about humanities and the sciences. But but that had I've been such some of the characters are social scientists and they're integral to this scientific project. And I was thinking about exactly what you're saying with storytelling and how what what humanities and social sciences bring to science are a sense of history and also an ability to analyze social data, which is increasingly for especially in in the realm of technology. But in but also in a lot of areas of things like you know infrastructure design and stuff that really does hit up against you know hard sciences or hard engineering. You know we actually need to understand how humans act over time and and what humans have done at various points pressure points or you know what they do when they get into a big crowd versus what they do when they disperse. And there are patterns you know they're not it's not perfectly reproducible as a as an ideal scientific experiment would be and that's very frustrating because if only we always just acted the same way all the time we could fix a lot of problems with humanity. That's why he's better become a physicist than a sociologist it's way easier to study atoms than people. Yeah except except when there's all these like there's like dark matter and like you know magical particles. It's very simple really. No yeah it really is compared to any person. Is it simple because you just like just put like dark in front of it and then you just like is it dark matter? Is it dark energy? Whatever you can literally write down on one page a model that fits all of the data right. Can you even imagine doing that with people? No I mean it's just not of course we don't know exactly what the dark matter is it could be quite complicated but in terms of explaining what you see out there in galaxies in the universe the physics you need to imagine the dark matter has is actually really simple so I'm very happy in telling my students that people with short attention spans should go into physics rather than social sciences because you can simplify things way down and the things still works that's the miracle. Yeah I mean I do think there are efforts to do that with the social sciences I think game theory is a great example of sort of social science trying to reduce all of human interactions to kind of these few basic laws and that's what's wrong with game theory is that you know it works sometimes in some situations if you're literally playing a game or actually I love in the new movie Crazy Rich Asians that game theory becomes like an integral part of how to have a romance which in fact is kind of written into the history of game theory in a way so anyway it works in some cases but it certainly you know doesn't explain all the ambigame.

That's right yeah and a lot of that does I mean it doesn't end up coming down to as you're saying like the fact that individual humans sometimes react in ways that we don't expect crowds of humans sometimes react in ways that we don't expect and it's you can say okay there's these general we see these general rules if we look at the long arc of recorded history in the west we can say all right you know we see you know general patterns emerging in terms of how people group together and what kinds of political structures they seem to enjoy but there's a huge variety of those political structures there's a huge variety of ways that we've gotten together so it's hard I mean it's there's so tempting to be like all right I'm gonna come up with the universal theory of human relationships or of human development in some ways and you know everybody's tried it Karl Marx tried to do it in the 19th century and you know it doesn't it doesn't ever completely work out. Well I think we even know why it doesn't work out right I mean the famous example is Isaac Asmolven's psychohistory right and he had in mind I think it was pretty explicit in the novels he had this analogy when you have a bunch of atoms in a box of gas you can extrapolate general rules for their behavior as a fluid right thermodynamics since the statistical mechanics so of course when you get many people you can do the same thing but as a physicist there's an obvious flaw in that reasoning which is that in the case of atoms they just simply bump into each other and respond in a very linear way small things remain small or even get smoothed out wild fluctuations get canceled out by all the other fluctuations whereas in a group of human beings who interact very strongly and non-linearly tiny fluctuations can be amplified very very strongly it is absolutely possible from a physics point of view to understand why groups of people can be influenced by individuals that have a strong impact on the others. Yeah I'm reading a novel right now called An Unkindness of Ghosts by Rivers Solomon which just came out it's it's really great it's a generation ship novel and so it's set in the future because you know we don't have generation ships yet and that's what they'll have you believe. Yeah I'm sure that like you know harp is working on it but one of the things that's great in in Solomon's novel is that she deals with the way that this generation ship has recreated plantation life and so they have slaves and servants who are living in the lower decks and doing all the scut work and then they have kind of the plantation owners and it does break down along familiar racial lines in this book where there's sort of lighter skinned people on top darker skinned people on the bottom and this is a great example of that of of an author trying to play with what you're talking about we're a tiny or or a large fluctuation continues to echo over centuries you know so there's been this incredible historical disturbance of this slavery of Africans in the United States and it doesn't just go away it doesn't like the the kind of ripples that have propagated out from that historical trauma just don't you know you would hope like you would wish that they would just kind of bump into other things and like that those ripples would like bump into the Obama presidency and be like aha everything's fixed but it isn't fixed and in fact sometimes the effects get bigger over time or they return in new ways that are just as pernicious and so that's the fun part of being a writer it's the sad part of history but the fun part of being a writer is thinking about how there are these social effects that can have very unexpected consequences and also that they can continue you know to me like writing about the future that's one of the pleasures of it is I think for some science fiction writers the pleasure is coming up with all the new shit you know like oh my god we're gonna have you know faster than light travel or we're gonna you know implant other personalities inside our heads and to me I was I was really interested in how how would history you know come back in some new form and how would we continue to have some of the same struggles which is probably partly why I was excited about talking about economics because I don't think in 150 years we're gonna have gotten rid of capitalism and we're not gonna be you know science is not magically gonna pay for itself and so I really wanted to like think about how people in the future would still be even though there's many many things that are different even though they have hard AI which is a kind of magical dubious thing but they also are still trying to get grants and they're still struggling with social inequality tell us a little bit more about exactly what you imagined economically in autonomous or in fact tell us about autonomous just a little bit so those have not yet read it she won't you can follow along um so autonomous is about a pharmaceutical pirate she is a former academic synthetic biologist and wants to bring medicine to people who are poor or just don't have any money at all who don't have access to it and she's found that working in academia isn't allowing her to do that there's too much there's too much political stuff there's too many corporations that want to hold on to those drug patents so she becomes a pirate and starts creating versions of these expensive medicines for free or for very cheap to give to people who can't afford them and she comes on the radar of the corporation whose drugs she's ripping off and they send a couple of agents after her basically to render her because they don't there's a couple of other things that they're trying to cover up that she knows about and render here being a euphemism for exterminate pretty much they're not the the corporation isn't worried about that's a field yeah and so the agents who come after her become main characters in the book as well and we switch back and forth between Jack the pirate and paladin the robot who is part of this a team of agents chasing after Jack and so the world that they're in is a world where basically the UN has been replaced by a group that I call the International Property Coalition so human rights have kind of been superseded by property rights and that's kind of how people think of human rights is in the context of property which makes sense because robots are human equivalent in this world and they are born indentured to pay off the cost of their manufacture and eventually through some legal shenanigans that have happened in the past and there's like a tiny info dump where we learn this in the book humans also are now subject to what they call the human rights indenture laws so you have the lucky right that if you need to you can sell yourself to someone and they will own you for a separate of time and of course there's a ton of abuses in the system and basically it's a story about the future of slavery and how how do we reinvent slavery and give it a bunch of euphemisms and a big part of that is the economic system in one of the sort of large economic coalitions that we see a lot which is kind of a combination of north it's basically North America it's Canada and the U.S have become this kind of free trade zone and in order to work or own house or go to school in the free trade zone you have to buy a franchise in a city and when you do that you know you pay a certain amount of money to get in and then you pay every year and then you get free healthcare you get the right to work and live there you get free schooling you get free internet emergency services all the things that you would expect to get paid for by the government in our world well not all of those but many of those we dream about them yeah we dream about some of those but things like having roads and having access to education and things like that we kind of think of as just well that's just what you get you know of course you have roads you know that's part of what you pay taxes for at a minimum we also imagine that you know in our world we think oh well you should have the right to work anywhere and in this future you know that has that right just hasn't doesn't exist anymore you know if you want to work somewhere you have to pay in so you pay and there's this parallelism for human beings who are allowed to sell themselves into indenture and the AI robots which are sort of automatically there until they can buy their eye out if I am remembering it correctly yeah so basically when robots are pretty much when all robots are born and these are these are of course artificially intelligent robots so they're you know they their consciousness isn't like a humans but it is equivalent to a humans they have you know feelings and desires and things like that so yes so they're the law says that they can be indentured for up to 10 years to whoever manufactures them like I said to pay off the cost of their manufacturer and not all robots survive that period of time but if they do then they are given an autonomy key and are allowed to kind of go be productive members of society and we do get to see a couple moments of where we meet some robots that have gotten out of indenture and they you know one of the things they love to do is just go shopping because they're basically people yeah they're like now we're free and so we'll go shopping at a mall in Vancouver so the so the the economy is you know it's a hyper capitalist economy where you know a lot of the things that we think of as our rights which have nothing to do with capitalism they just have to do with how the United States was set up those rights have been taken away like I said the right to work wherever you want the right to live wherever you want but they have been replaced by new property rights where you can pay to work where you want and pay to live where you want and so that's why people get indentured because if you don't have enough money to pay to be part of a city or or some other community you're just going to die unless you sell yourself yeah so those are your choices die or become indentured so it reminds us we do take things for granted right both explicitly and implicitly in our laws we have rights that we label and some I was talking to law professor on a different episode of the podcast not yet released but about the fact that there's a lot of things we think should be rights that no one ever thought to put in the constitution because everyone knows that they're rights right and we might even have mentioned that the right to work as as one of them and but that can be taken away especially if the economic system changes it's it's very true and I it was because I was talking to an economist as I was coming up as I was doing world building on this that I thought about that because he he pointed out this is our friend Noah Smith I bet right this is our friend Noah Smith who is a dedicated dystopian thinker and even though he's a pretty cheerful guy no opinion on twitter yes notorious twitter personality and he he said exactly what we're saying you know he was like well we think that we should just be allowed to live wherever we want but actually that's a really amazing right to just have that at birth like a lot of civilizations didn't have that and don't have that so so basically I just had to take away some of these basic rights from my characters and suddenly it made perfect sense that people would choose to be indentured and and indeed I mean even in our world now like there's plenty of jobs that people do that are basically indentured I mean well kind of like being a grad student for example and I was definitely thinking of that I spent many many years as a grad student and I definitely have grumpy feeling about my employment situation we prefer apprenticeship to indentured servitude which is just another way of saying indentured you know it's like you're and in fact you're paying in you know it's the university system is like you pay in in order to have the right to work there at least in my experience and you know I mean some people get fancier deals probably but the poor if he a humanities graduate student physics graduate students get paid it's true yeah I mean we got paid a little bit and I was you know and I was kind of on the border with social science so maybe but we yeah certainly was not in some ways it's good that it's not like science because there's nobody who has to scramble to get money to pay us because there's no money there's no money but the department kind of would try to hand out jobs in a relatively equitable way so you know it's like here's a thousand dollars for this semester everybody gets a thousand dollars for the semester yay and how did it work in terms of the mechanics of writing the novel going back and forth between world building and storytelling I presume that the world building influences the storytelling but do you have you know pages and pages of unpublished world building materials stuck on your hard drive somewhere I do have an embarrassingly large amount of world building materials that never made it in um a lot of stuff I think has to be barely painted in the background because you know readers don't want to wade through like a giant info down for it's like as you know Bob like in this world here's how indenture works and you know as you move into the cities this is what's happening so really like the book the way the book comes together I think or came together for me and I think the way novels generally come together for me is it starts with characters and I start to think about the world that they're in and then I have to really focus on the character to write the book and I feel like that's kind of laying the the groundwork is okay here's the characters here's what happens to them here's how they change or don't change and then I have to come back again kind of at the end and say okay so what are the rules of the world I need to smooth this out and make sure everything is consistent otherwise every nerd in the universe is going to be smacking their face as they read this book because it's just completely incoherent in terms of how the world works here's a tip for growing your business get the venture x business card from capital one and start earning a limited double miles on every purchase that's right with unlimited double miles the more your business spends the more miles you earn plus the venture x business card has no preset spending limit so your purchasing power can adapt to meet your business needs the venture x business card also includes access to over a thousand airport lounges just imagine where the venture x business card from capital one can take your business capital one what's in your wallet terms and conditions apply find out more at capital one dot com slash venture x business I mean that's interesting I think and I noticed this with my wife Jennifer who's also a science writer and awesome science writer and awesome science writer that was implicit we write our books very differently and I'm guessing that if I were to write a novel I would write it very differently than that like I would have to do all the world building first and then have to come up with what the characters are doing in that world just like when I write my nonfiction books I start with chapter one and then chapter two and then chapter three in Jennifer can start with chapter seven just like it's no big deal and drives you crazy I definitely with with both my fiction and nonfiction writing because I do nonfiction books as well I have to start with chapter one two and I I know people like Jennifer who are like no but start in the middle and and I have writer friends who do fiction who they you know they'll they'll kind of write a bunch of scenes and then figure out where they go and that drives me crazy I have to know I have to know what the world is and I have to know what the care I have to start with the characters from the beginning and go to the end and it's true with when I get to the end I go back to the beginning and sort of clean everything up but yeah I have I'm very linear I guess I live in linear times so I try to honor that in my work and it's one of the good things about different ways of creating things I remember when we did a science consult with Ridley Scott for one of his movies that hasn't been made yet he was going to adapt the forever war by the Joe Alderman novel yeah and yeah so there was no script written yet of course the novel had been written but it was clear that Ridley Scott had in his mind certain very specific scenes all painted out right like he knew visually what it was going to be like and the words you know they would they would appear you know to fit whatever you wanted to happen but he knew what it would look like from the start and that's yet another way to start with a project like that yeah and I think I mean for sure like the novel I'm working on right now which I'm almost done with like there were certain scenes that I knew I wanted in there toward the end and I kept thinking I didn't write them down because I didn't I wasn't there yet but I was so like just the other day I wrote one of them finally and I was like yes I finally wrote that scene and you know so there is definitely like you I feel like in TV writing people call them beats and it's you know you know where the beats are going to be and then you kind of write yourself into them and you like sorry let me back up there's a whole long tradition of scientists diving in and writing the occasional science fiction novel with mixed results shall we say right I mean we're we're trained through a lifetime of being an academic to talk and think one way and being a fiction writer is very different now you got your start as a science writer I guess as a tech writer and then a science writer and then you made the transition into fiction so what was that like were you always planning to write fiction at some point or was it a huge change of gears it was a pretty big change of gears I already I thought I had already been through the big transition when I moved from writing as an academic to writing popular work writing journalism and sort of pop science and and also of course I switched from kind of a humanities focus to looking at tech and science so I was like okay I'm done with all my big transitions and yeah it never really works out that way and so making the transition from academic writing to popular writing I have to say was actually much more difficult in many ways than transitioning from science nonfiction to science fiction because when you're writing for an academic audience you're trying to do so many things that are very different like you're not worried about popular or mass appeal you often are like buried in a long tradition of thought and so you're having to kind of talk about here's what everybody else in this field has done here's my one tiny contribution that like takes us slightly forward into the left and with pop fiction and nonfiction you don't have to do as much of that kind of work I mean part of your job is also just to engage the reader which you know it's a whole it's a whole craft that you have to learn how to be engaging and how to tell a story that people want to keep reading I think so many academics have zero training or interest in learning about yeah right and that but that was actually like hard it's like a hard transition because one of the things the one of the freedoms that academic writing gives you is to be as weird and quirky as you want and like have like a title for your essay that's like some weird play on an 18th century poem and like the three people that read that article are going to be like yes that's so funny and I was hilarious and you feel like wow I that was so sophisticated they were like 90 levels of references there and like that's not something you can do in popular fiction I mean in some limited ways you can do that for sure and I definitely have like weird obscure references in my books but that can't be the whole thing you know you also have to tell story that's like that's the people can relate to and that speaks to a lot of people and not just like the five people that are interested in like Marx's cultural studies which is what I was doing so so you think that the experience of going through that transition and becoming a popular science writer was extremely helpful for your next transition into fiction it really was because I had already before I wrote autonomous or actually I should say in the middle of writing autonomous because I wrote a really shitty first draft which I put away and then wrote a scatter adapt and remember which is a nonfiction science book about mass extinction and how humans will survive the current mass extinction and that book I did a lot of learning about how to structure an arc in a in a book you know like how to make it have a beginning middle and end I don't think I fully succeeded but I definitely but the failures there helped teach me oh you know I need to have this kind of connective tissue um you know Aristotle was right about storytelling right I mean this is a reason why someone pointed out that why Hollywood movies do well compared to a lot of foreign films it's not that Hollywood movies appeal to lowest common denominator but they understand story structure there are acts there are conflicts that get resolved at the right time and that's a whole skill to have to learn yeah it's there's that's a big part of it and certainly I mean I've been reading science fiction my whole life and so I definitely have like a template in my head where it's like oh you know this is how you tell a story you do what Octavia Butler would do or you do what Ursula Ligwin would do um and you know there have been many times when I've thought what would Octavia Butler would Octavia do of course um yeah and like and she would basically you know she's famous for having spent lots of time with false starts and revision and you know writing like half a novel and tossing it aside because she was very exacting about how to tell a story and that's why her stories are so engaging and like stick with you for so long so I think I um I really enjoyed making the transition I was really surprised that it worked so well and I was even more surprised that people actually liked autonomous because I thought it was just going to be like a weird book about like robot sex and people would be there be like for it would be like my academic writing like for people would be like this is the greatest thing ever and everybody else would be like that book happened I don't know um so I was so gratified that my um you know weird ideas and my my efforts to make them appeal to more than just me actually kind of worked so to be to be fair there is robot sex there in the book or actually is there robot sex there's robot on human sex I mean that's robot sex any time robots are having sex any time robots are having sex it's robot sex but um yeah and I mean that was part of what you know like there's some quirky stuff in this novel and so you know as well as you know of course my exegesis on the future of economics um there's also uh you know human relationships and romance and stuff like that so and I think that's part of what people really liked um even though palette and the robot does some mean things um she's also a really relatable character and she's she's kind of just been born in a way she's just been booted up so she's learning not to be a jerk well we have to talk about palette in a little bit palette in the robot uh what we talked about the economics and how that goes into the world building there's also a lot of ideas in the novel about AI and robots in general and so one of the things you you already touched on so I just want to touch on it again we're certainly sympathetic with paladin right I mean it's you know she's discovering herself and sort of a newbie in the world and an anjianu and discovering things and then she kills people pretty ruthlessly all the time and yeah it's almost like you have to read it twice like did that really just happen was that a intentional uh kind of mood setting device or how did that come to you so paladin was the first character that came to me in the novel so that I sort of started with paladin and and kind of ended with paladin too because when I when I did my major revision paladin was the character that changed the most and I I felt like I I like characters who are complex and in a gray area and this is a robot that was designed to be a combat robot like you know there's no question why paladin is there is basically just to you know do some reconnaissance and then do some killing killing people part of the job yeah part of the programming part of the job and part of his programming and he starts out as basically owned by a military branch of the African Federation and the African Federation is kind of like the EU for African nations in this future and so it's a bunch of African nations kind of um sharing the same currency and things like that so uh so he's owned by the African Federation everyone just kind of assumes he's a he because if you're a big giant bulky terminator looking mother fucker you must be a dude um and he doesn't really care one way or the other but um but his gender identity he's a robot he's like whatever I don't really have gender um but as the book goes along and he starts learning more about people and how people relate to each other and what they think of as being important um he starts to uh he wants to change his pronouns so she becomes she in the middle of the book kind of arbitrarily uh for a bunch of reasons that I don't want to spoil um and so she kind of goes through some of the things that a human teenager might go through you know she's she's just been booted up she's kind of questioning the role that she's been assigned in the world she's questioning who she is and who she can love and um and you know how she wants humans to perceive her because changing her pronoun of course is all about um you know what humans perceive because again robots don't really care about gender that much um so I I wanted people to like have this sort of crunchy difficult relationship with paladin and not have it be just like paladin is a an innocent sweet robot you know paladin crushes people's brains like that's her job and you know she eventually toward the end is kind of like huh why am I doing this job well I'll just kill some more people brainfushing is that really my purpose yet and she never has again I mean I I don't kind of spoon feed the reader like she never has a moment where she kind of scratches her head and is like what is meaning of life um but she does start questioning um her programming and she's given a chance to really see how she's been programmed and that's a really important turning point and again for me this was a lot of it was thinking about uh what it again what it's like to be a teenager or what it's like to become a young adult and suddenly you realize that there's all this stuff you're doing just because you've been told that you should do it and just because you've been told it's right and you know lots of people for example grow up with religious programming and they just have never questioned it and all of a sudden they're like wait why am I doing all this stuff do I really believe this how do I how do I want to be religious do I want to be and paladin's kind of going through something like that um with her pro programming is kind of rethinking all the stuff she's been taught and so that was so fun to write um especially because you know unlike a person who can't necessarily go into their own mind and be like I have here I have discovered the programming called Catholic church and now I can remove it um because you just can't do that you can't remove it if you're a person but for a robot she actually can go in eventually and see all the programs she's running and be like oh that's why I was feeling that way oh I could modify that um so like robots would be great in therapy that's what I think you can we will be very not not a very uh lucrative customer because you know fix that and let it go like that's not what a therapist wants at all yeah I mean but it might be really complex like it might therapists might have to essentially like a robot therapist would have to be basically some kind of programmer um or maybe even a hacker you know because you'd have to build little hacks to kind of get around like well you need this program but this program is also telling you to like fall in love with guides who are really bad for you but we want to keep part of the program but not that other part so you know it's it can be complex well I so I have thoughts on this both ways one is uh it's it's it's provocative to think about an artificially intelligent mind uh being able to pinpoint programs that give them motivation to do certain things in certain ways because it teaches us or makes us think something about human beings like in some sense where robots were computers anyway were physical organisms there's things in our brains going on that's right might imagine pinpointing oh there's the part of my brain that makes me fall in love with bad boys who I know will cheat on me uh and would we want to go in there or you know pay money to the surgeon to go in there and fix that part of our brain yeah I mean that's kind of the question that's asked in the movie the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind where there's a technology I love that movie um and I'm sure it's sort of part of what influenced me um and that that in that movie there's a technology where you can nuke a set of memories so that you you know you can forget a mean person in your life or maybe you can forget your your lust for bad boys or whatever um so yeah I think that that is a question that um you know these characters have to deal with uh for paladin that's less of a concern because she can see all of the modifications she's making and um but there are that said there are moments where she's having to second guess the humans around her because she knows that the humans don't have that same ability and so she has to say okay is this person speaking to me out of their programming or do they really mean it right and again that's a very human question because you never know is this person just being polite or do they really like me um and so that's that's you know and so um the fun thing with paladin is that while she's having these very human thoughts I also you know based her consciousness on basically a unix system and thought about how you know early unix computers networked with each other and what would it be like if you had a consciousness that had kind of grown out of um computer networks and how would you how would these a i's communicate with each other and so I have them doing um you know secure handshakes and when they meet each other they're speaking to each other wirelessly the robots are and kind of announcing themselves in the same way that um you know data announces itself to a computer on the network where it says hello here comes my data um so I'm kind of translating from you know what packets are saying as they reach a port um and so I felt like I made paladin sufficiently alien and sufficiently connected to a tradition of um computer minds um that you know some of her problems really aren't human problems like some of her problems are really like network security problems and you know there is a whole bit where she has to kind of um she kind of has to deal with what it means to have a mind that is stored in the cloud and she doesn't control that you know her the company that owns her um basically owns her backups which is her mind and so that's a thing that humans haven't really had to deal with quite yet and not in a literal sense anyway and I think that this does also raises questions about artificial intelligence so I think that the the fact that paladin can sort of pinpoint in her brain certain programs that make her feel certain ways provokes us into thinking a certain way about uh human free will right but on the flip side of that uh I am a little skeptical that artificial intelligence would work as sort of conscious human level AI if you couldn't reprogram yourself you know I mean I hear so many conversations about artificial intelligence that are about how we should program the computer so it doesn't do bad things and I can't really imagine that that would qualify as artificial intelligence if it couldn't change its mind in some profound way I completely agree with you and um one of the things I've said about this book uh over and over is that it's it is science fiction but there is this fantasy at the heart of it which is that we just sort of wave our hands and have strong AI and don't ask any questions right because I think that in real life um as we explore more and more what machine learning means and what it means to build machine learning algorithms into other applications um we're realizing that first of all we don't know what the hell intelligence is at all like in humans in anything like we are totally square one with that and I mean sure there's a lot of people who have a lot of different definitions but um you know trying to recreate something that we can't even quantify in ourselves is really tough um the other thing that I think we're learning is that intelligence to the extent that it can be talked about is really an ecosystem there's different kinds of intelligence and I'm not just talking about dumb stuff like emotional intelligence which I think whatever that's like a self-help book thing I mean kinds of intelligence that work on different kinds of problems intelligence that presents itself as maybe not seeming very intelligent um or but it actually is really into doing some one particular task or a set of tasks um and I think uh the whole movement around um sort of the idea of neuro-typicality being actually not really that typical uh is really helping us in a way much more than um then you might think uh in terms of defining intelligence because once we have an idea that there's a spectrum of what it means to have consciousness and intelligence and it's not just like here's the one kind of consciousness that we recognize as intelligent and everything other than that is like autistic or you know it gets a frenic or whatever the other names are that we're using uh at whatever point in history um so which is a very abstract way of saying that um when we actually if we ever do have something that resembles what gets called strong AI which is basically human equivalent AI it may actually look nothing like paladin it may uh express itself in ways that are really hard for us to relate to um it may be like talking to a very non-neurotypical person and we're gonna have to learn to kind of translate from those machines and I think some of them might turn out to be kind of like paladin but I agree with you that if we really wanted to imitate a human mind it would have to be self-modifying in some way and if it weren't self-modifying um I don't know if I would say it couldn't be human equivalent but it would be equivalent to a human who had been horribly abused and and kind culturally programmed like maybe like a cult victim or something like that um someone who hadn't been allowed to make any choices and and as a result maybe was um you know had had experienced a huge amount of trauma did you know fast growing trees is the biggest online nursery in the US with thousands of different plants and over two million happy customers they have all the plants your yard

suspicion is that we'll have a hundred different kinds of artificial intelligence before we have anything that is really like a human being I think that we way underestimate how hard it is to get something that's like a human being I think it will happen that is a obstacle in principle but there's many different ways to be intelligent we're discovering this already it's way easier to build a computer that will win at chess than a computer that will carry on a fun conversation with you and part of that is that it's not just you know processing power but it's also motivations it's our brains are embodied in our bodies that you know get hungry and thirsty and want to reproduce and you want to sing songs and it's going to be if you could have other motivations for an embodied robot but they wouldn't be the same so I would be surprised the first second third fourth generations of AI were anything like human beings at all I think I mean as as we've been saying I think it's going to be an ecosystem so I think there's going to be some AI's whose motivations are incredibly difficult for us to relate to we might know what those motivations are but they won't fit anything we we won't be able to feel those motivations in the same way an AI might on the other hand if we do assume that we can create a human equivalent AI program it we might very well program it to have the same kinds of fucked up desires that humans do right like it might we might give it what what Foucault calls a perverse implantation which is just his way of talking about how we sort of teach people to to think that their own desires are terrible and wrong even though we feel them all the time because they're as you said where we live in meat sacks and we have built-in urges and needs but using culture we can try to train people that these urges and needs are bad and and can modify them right so we can modify how people want to have sex or we can modify how people want to eat that's why people have so many weird rituals around sex and food because these are these basic things that we want and culture has just like swarmed all over them and like messed them up and made them complex in ways that are like infinite you know it's like just like infinite complexity laid on top of like basically just eating and reproducing people these are not complex activities but we've we've really we fetishize them to the point of like absurdity and so I think you could imagine a robot that um you know had a lot of hang ups um Martha Wells has a great series called Murderbot which is a series of novellas which I highly recommend where she has a robot who has a lot of social problems and partly due to its programming partly due to the fact that like paladin it's kind of a murder bot you know it's a murder bot it's designed to kill and protect and and it copes with all of its problems and all of its hang ups by downloading a huge amount of soap operas to its local memory and then just watching soaps and um and it's you know it's this very human you know tick that this robot has but it made me think about how we really could through cultural conditioning create AI that are very human and that learn about life from from stories and that um you know crave stories in the same way that that people do and so I think you know like I said it's going to be an ecosystem and it's going to be way weirder than we thought I don't think we're going to have a robot uprising I think it's much more like robots and AI and machine learning will kind of merge into human society in ways that are sometimes hard to tell apart from human society like if you get an implant that's kind of an AI or you kind of become partly AI I think it's that the I think we're going to end up with a spectrum it you know where it's there's totally biological human intelligence all the way on the other side is like totally machine intelligence and you know everything in the middle yeah I think that's exactly right and I'm on your side there did you get did you do a lot of conversing with AI experts and robot experts for the novel just like economics I did yes I talked to I talked to um hardware experts about how a robot body would be put together because that was something that I didn't know very much about I read a lot about AI and machine learning I had also already been you know writing in my journalism a lot about it and a lot about just computer networks in general I used to when I first started my career I wrote a lot about computer security and hacking which is actually a great way to learn about computer networking because it's all about the ways that you know subversive activities can take place and people can kind of sneak around all of the protocols or all of the you know all of the things that are supposedly safe and so it's in a way it's almost like studying computer security or writing about is almost like looking at computer network neurosis because it's all about how to like unwanted thoughts and and applications appear in this like good pure mind of the computer or mind of your network of computers and so um so I had kind of all of that stuff in my head and it had been sitting in my head for a pretty long time so I was like at last I can finally use this knowledge to build a robot so your grand unified theory is that everything we do is a kind of therapy for one thing or another well or the opposite right like that everything we do everything is a neurosis and what we're doing is trying to you know deal with our neurosis become functionally neurotic. Yeah. I mean and just to like not kill each other like ultimately like I think a lot of my work including the novel I'm working on now like the big struggle is just like just don't kill each other you know like I know you're mad I know you're feeling neurotic but just you know put the gun down no brain crushing let's just work it out like grown up robots. Speaking of neurotic you also there's a whole sort of get another technological angle in autonomous where uh they're the synthetic drugs being made and then pirated that's what Jack does for a living and so you also talk into pharma people and biochemists about how drugs could make you more or less neurotic or helpful or less. Yes I did um talk to a lot of very um kind and sympathetic biologists I talk to a couple of synthetic biologists um I talked to a genetic engineer about kind of about the lab scenes I gave him an early copy of the book and it was really funny because he was like well you know actually the lab scenes are fine like and you know this is all you know this is all good but you call there's this one machine that you have and it's a fabber and it's like why is everything a fabber like that is not how it would work like there would be it might have the same technology but like there'd be a bunch of different special use cases and all different kinds of fabbers so that is just terrible and so I actually did go in and and change it so that a lot of things now that we used to be called a fabber have other names there's like cookers and there's you know devices again special use devices that are basically 3d printers that print tissue or print you know print various molecular structures and stuff like that so um so that was really helpful and then I did talk to neuroscientists about the drug that the characters are taking which is getting them addicted to work and they um and I was like okay here's how the drug would work and what do you think and they were like oh yeah wow that could work oh that's so evil yes oh very evil so they were excited about the evil that happens all the time I mean when I'd have done the movie consulting you know it's a physicist consulting with people making movies is fairly straightforward right like the answer to everything is you need a wormhole to do it but biologists that's what you told me when I consulted because it's the truth I'm excited you don't need a physics consultant you just need an AI chatbot to say yes yes you need a wormhole just put the wormhole in there it's not realistic but you need it anyway but if you want if the if you're a writer producer whatever you say okay I need an organism you know a germ that will go in and have the following terrible effect on humankind the biologists will go no I don't think that oh oh yeah oh yeah sure we can do that no problem and it's kind of scary from that point of view yeah um and in fact like I I just outright stole some ideas with permission from from some of the biologists I talked to I have like a final you know final boss fight scene where they're using a bunch of cool futuristic technology they're sort of repurposing stuff and and the biologists I was talking to said oh but you know you couldn't do that but you could do this other thing which would cause his skin to like erupt with stuff and I was like oh yeah so anyway that's not too much of a spoiler but um and you like they pay me to do this this is the best thing ever how could I get a job so good yeah well I also just like I always have like a warm feeling when a scientist tells me that something is plausible even if they're sort of saying like with a caveat that of course it's not plausible it's like like when you told me about wormholes I was like okay I can use wormholes because Sean said it's okay even though he said also wormholes couldn't really exist but he said they could kind of maybe possibly exist like there are different levels there's an ecosystem of violating the laws of physics right so that's perfectly there's acceptable ones and less acceptable ones yeah yeah exactly I think the thing that's most important to me when representing science is trying to represent the scientific process accurately which is to say showing people testing things and retesting them and like how do you test things you know like I have a character who's testing photonic molecule levels which is not a thing there is not photonic molecules but um but you would in fact have to go test the levels on on a device over and over to kind of make the the suppositions that she does so I wanted at least to be honest in that way so that people understand that science is actually a lot of dreary testing um and not a lot of gazing rapturously into glowing holes and saying like it's full of stars will allow some absurdity but we want our absurdities to be grounded in the scientific method as much as possible exactly and how much of the discussion of the intersection between economics and pharma in the book was a commentary of reflection or inspired by the real world right now a hundred percent inspired by the real world I mean I I live in the real world um maybe to my detriment um and so everything I write about is you know my brain takes it in and I either consciously or probably a lot of the times unconsciously kind of smoosh it up and try to rethink it and put it on the page so um I've like a lot of people in the United States I've seen I've had many friends that suffered horribly because they couldn't afford medical treatments um and so that was very much on my mind and pharma companies are huge like it's a huge business and it's poorly understood and the way that they make money um overlaps a lot with the patent system which is also poorly understood and so you know it's a great way to just rip people off and and you always have a captive audience nobody's been saying no to a drug that's going to cure them or it prolong their life so you know it's it's easy in some ways it's an easy target for a big bad um but it's also a uh you know it's it's a source of great anxiety and pain for lots of people so it's you know it it seemed like an obvious place to uh to poke and who doesn't want to farm a suitable pirate like that's the well I was going to say your protagonist is a biochemical pharmaceutical pirate so that's pretty good yeah I think and it's funny because after the novel came out um a few people have come out identifying as pharmaceutical pirates um and so I was excited about that I was like yes deal from the rich give to the poor um that's that's my my hope is that it is closer to Robinhood than real piracy right I mean it's your real pirates or yes in it for themselves it's at jack's character is very much like in the Robinhood tradition right explicitly thinking about Robinhood who is like one of my very favorite mythical characters ever so and so why don't you just give us a teaser for the next one are you are you I should say are you mostly a fiction writer now you're still writing nonfiction also I am trying to be by which is hard nobody really acknowledges these by by textual people like me um but I am working on two books right now one of which is nonfiction which is about ancient abandoned cities focusing on four cities specifically and looking at why people abandoned them even though they were kind of cities that were at the heart of their civilizations um and sort of using that to think about the modern world and what we're going to do with our mega cities um and I'm also working on a novel which is about time traveling geologists um so it's great to be working on something about ancient history while I'm also writing about time travel because whenever I feel the need like desperately as I'm writing about archaeology like I wish I could just go back and find out what really happened I'm like I will go over to my novel where all they have to do is like get a grant to use the time machine in order to go back and find out what happened um so uh so it's it's been a really fun past year although very stressful and um I'm trying to write a lot of stuff but uh but the novel should be out next fall and um the nonfiction book will probably be out um in 2020 yeah I mean I think there's a kind of a theme here I don't want to sort of force a theme where it's not there but you've written about how we're going to survive and apocalypse well sorry what was the title of that book again scatter adapt and remember right how we will survive a mass extinction yes and it depends on the mass extinction right and very much so there's a lot of instructions in the book yeah and now you have the book on ancient cities where they I mean was it mostly I don't spoil alert I suppose but is it mostly that they chose to leave them or were they forced to leave them for some reason or another um it's always a combination um in you know that these were cities that were abandoned which means that people you know left them they weren't um forced out by invading forces in any of the cases I'm looking at um in one case like with Pompeii I mean the city was buried in ash um but other cities that were buried in ash at that same time were dug out um and like Naples which was uh you know affected as well um but Pompeii was not and um so I'm looking at what are the precipitating factors that turn a huge city like say anchor which had a million people uh about a thousand years ago which made it the biggest city on earth at that time how did that go from the biggest city on earth and then within like 400 years to just a few monks living in you know kind of ruined remains um can we blame neuroses for this uh you know I mean there's the neuroses that you you know once you get a bunch of humans together in a city um yeah you know the neuroses become things like historical trauma and you know also like infrastructure upkeep like that turns out to be a big issue um politics are a huge part of what um causes a city of fail but politics alone won't do it it's really um gotta be combined with some kind of environmental problem whether the problem is actually climate change or yeah you know mismanaging the water supply or whatever so uh so I don't know if that's a neurosis or just but it is certainly a recurring human problem yeah we see it over and over again um so scatter adapt and remember that was the title that's the title of my first book um and the nonfiction book I'm working on now about abandoned cities is just called for lost cities but I like scatter adapt and remember is kind of the theme right running through the fiction as well as the nonfiction there's you know human beings trying to adapt to challenging circumstances and choosing different modes of doing that's very true I mean for me uh in all of my work um I have a strong wish to urge people to survive and try to survive in a way that helps lots of other people survive with them um I mean I was joking earlier about the whole goal with my fiction is just to tell people not to kill each other not killing don't kill that's number one um and I mean that's part of you know that's a joke but also that is part of what I'm trying to do and my nonfiction is kind of show people ways that humans have survived and how even when um horrible circumstances you know kick them out of a really awesome city they still manage to survive their culture lives on humans live on um and we create you know new social structures that are hopefully a little bit less inclined to encourage people to kill each other um you know that's the goal just like less and less pressure to kill more and more pressure to um you know take care of everyone um so so yeah survival and survival in style I would say and survival in style is good I just noticed in one interview someone wanted to paint autonomous as a dystopian novel but you said it's just the topia it's either a dystopia nor a utopia that's the usual in between somewhere yeah just just how things are now I mean sometimes things are a little worse sometimes they're a little better for certain groups of people um but yeah I mean I definitely autonomous there's a lot of things that happen that are yeah they're positive um you know there's great medicine available if you can afford it um so you just need a pirate to help make that you know a better system um and and certainly um in in the time travel novel I'm working on now there's like there's some bad stuff but there's some good stuff fall down you can write a novel where everyone's happy and just sitting around saying how happy there are but maybe the descriptions of less than perfect situations can help nudge us here in the real world toward making things a little bit better I think that's true and I I don't think we're ever going to reach a point as a civilization or a species where we're happy all the time like even if we um you know have a an awesome genie coefficient and we don't have like an extreme division between rich and poor and we don't have like massive social injustice we're still going to argue you know we're still going to have jealousy we're still going to be sad when someone dies or someone leaves us you know there's always going to be drama and sadness it's just that hopefully we can keep it on a kind of you know uh keep it on the keep it limited back to my point about not killing i'd like to have interpersonal drama and not have wars i think that's a perfect note to end on an elite new it's thanks so much for being on the podcast yeah thank you for having me
