Smith the zombie drummer Phil Tiber Doodas infinitas Ulrika Hagman Pascuale Jalati and I also want to thank somebody special Mary Neva, but of course she asked that I not give her a shout out, but instead give a shout out to her son who turned her on to talk nerdy So thank you so much to Jim Cooper Schmidt because you're the best Yes, you are actually everybody listening. You're the best But special props to Jim All right guys. I'm super excited about this week's show because I have the opportunity to have a really detailed chat with Dr Thomas D. Seely. He's the Horus White Professor in biology at Cornell He's in the Department of Neurobiology and behavior teaches about animal behavior But his research is really focused on the behavior and social life of honey bees He's written several books and he's won a ton of awards I didn't even realize this when we spoke But he received the Alexander von Humboldt Distinguished US scientist prize a Guggenheim fellowship a gold medal book award and he's also been elected a fellow of both the animal behavior society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences But he's most proud of having had a species of bee named after him. Yeah, that is like a huge honor His newest book is called the lives of bees the untold story of the honey bee in the wild So without any further ado here. He is Dr. Thomas Seely Well, Tom, thank you so much for joining me today It's my pleasure card to be with you today So we are going to be talking about your newest book the lives of bees the untold story of the honey bee in the wild But before we dive into that book I want to get a little bit of background because of course you are the bee guy You're like the expert in this field and this is not anywhere close to your first book about bees You've written I'm trying to to see here one two Three nope four books previous to this one. Is that correct? Yes, that's right You're well there And so the difference between this one specifically is That we are so used to thinking about honey bees and thinking about kept bees right bees in hives that people tend to in order to produce honey whether it's not like a commercial scale or just like backyard beekeepers But of course this species of bee Was a wild is a wild species that we then utilize it's not like we bred them to be honey bees Yes, the honey bee is an unusual Animal that humans have relied on extensively for thousands of years But we've never been very good at breeding them and that's because of the one feature of their biology which is that the matings occur When the queen flies out of a hive and she flies up into the sky and flies off and flies away and then mates with drones from Wherever from other colonies wherever in the in the area. So we we haven't had the The opportunity to tightly breed their biology. So they are I like to say the honey bee is still basically a wild animal And we see that very clearly when beekeepers have their colonies living in their hives But then those colonies in the spring cast swarms of bees That's and those swarms fly out and move into the woods and do just fine So the bee and the wow so the bees are still very much of self-sustaining wild creature Well, that's so interesting and it almost seems like it's probably quite good for their genetic diversity that they breed in that way It seems like it would prevent a lot of bottle necks. There are a lot of kind of potential in breeding Yes, they do see that's a very good point that Their ability to a queen when she goes out and mates It's very important to her that she captures a lot of genetic diversity and she does that by mating with about 15 different drones And we now know that The reason she's it's important for the bees to have a lot of diversity in each of their colonies is It helps them fight diseases. These are insects that live in large groups They have a lot of diseases especially of their brood which are developing in this warm and humid environment inside the nest or hive And so They the bees have to deal with diseases and the one of the key things is to have a lot of diversity among the members of the colony so This feature of their biology that keeps them wild keeps them healthy too I'm fascinating. So I there's so many questions. I have about like, you know The social structure and the hive structure and all that but maybe before we get into what we know now about bees We can take a little bit of a step back like the natural history of honey bees because Have we really been keeping them almost as long or longer than we've been I don't know trying to domesticate animals You We're not sure when the domestication or the keeping of bees which shouldn't say domestication the keeping of bees started We know that the the oldest records we have go back um About 4,500 years ago. These are paintings and Egyptian temples that show quite Sophisticated beekeepers However Our other animals though that have been domesticated or the start of agriculture and farming that goes back about 10 or 11,000 years so some were between those two times But what humans have been doing with bees goes back to even before we were humans I think in that humans always Greatly enjoyed honey. It was the original source of real sweet sweetness for humans and so We look if you look at the other um great apes the hmm for real is chimpanzees bonobos they all are honey hunters they go all go out and find Nests of of bees and steal their honey and I think humans have been doing that long from thousands And we've been around humans that maybe 300,000 years modern humans I bet all of those times those people were um doing just as the other primates do Um cut honey hunting and and enjoying the bees honey And so how did we I mean, I'm sure you don't know the answer to this question But it seems like such a dangerous proposition, right? I guess the nutritional value the high caloric content and the sweet taste um Was worth it But it seems interesting that the first person or the first ape or the first you know animal to say I'm gonna brave it Yeah, I don't care if I get stung You know, that's a very good point because you do have to you just have to suck it up But you have but the which is quite revealing in the sense that yes people were willing to endure the pain of the bees Stinks and we also have from cave paintings these drawings that show people climbing up Vines and primitive ladders sometimes falling off to get up to the nests of bees on cliff sites So yes, the honey has been in a very powerful lure and You know that I think it's hard for us to appreciate today with so with sugar so plentiful and so easily accessed Just what what it was like for People before the before humans were even farmers to um to get honey. I mean the you know, we know from the Bible I don't know if there really wasn't um, you know everything in the Bible is accurate, but um The Israelites were on told that they could find a be led to a land of milk and honey and that So honey I think the flavor of honey has has a power which we can't fully appreciate with our today in our world of You know sugar everywhere Yeah, and it's it's interesting that You know, it's not only human beings or the great apes that have kind of Utilized honey or or realized that honey has such power and such potential. I mean I'm I'm remembering like that there are African birds that are kind of commonly known as honey guides Which people will utilize to find honey because they themselves are attracted to To these beehives Yes, that's right. It's the honey guides are Go off and they attract the attention of people and once they want the honey guides first find an nest of bees and Go attract people by making certain sounds and then the The humans have learned to recognize. Oh, that's a honey guide. It wants us Yeah, once it's knows where there's a nest and then the honey guide will Lead the people in steps of about 50 yards and sometimes a little longer back to the bees nests And then the humans play an important role. They open up the nests You know, you know, which is something the honey guide birds cannot do And the honey's the humans then take out some of the honey and they pull out the combs But there's a lot of spillage of the brood of the bees and the honey and I think the birds are particularly interested in the brew the larvae and the pupae That's the most nutritious thing for them And we're kind of not as interested in that part at least not in modern kind of honey honey production That's right. Yeah, yes Oh, interesting, but our brains are really wilded up wired up not wilded up wired up Wild wired up to respond to sweetness and that would the original add up that are probably evolved originally not for Motivating us to get honey, but for enabling us to sense which which fruits are the most rewarding the cal- Calerific this which ones are fully ripe and sweet Absolutely and to kind of counter to that to avoid anything that might be potentially harmful or dangerous to us That might be more bitter in flavor It's so cool to think about that that this is a kind of I mean obviously what we know about evolution And it always bears repeating is that there's no specific path. There's no guide There's no end goal that this is just a series of like strange random mutations and pressures that nature You know exhibits at that time for no reason other than what is But it's it's always so interesting to see kind of co-evolution scenarios these ecological scenarios where specific species Co-evolved along with other specific species and there's these complex interplays that Are really valuable to to all of the organisms involved? Yes, and the one coming back to what we were talking about earlier one of the curious things about honey bees is that Humans and honey bees have lived together for a long time But again because we have not controlled their matings. We've not been able to shape their genetics and thus we they're still still an animal that thrives on its all on its own I love that there's something almost like romantic about that that like you know these organisms that can't be tamed and it's kind of like we have the privilege of being able to to To benefit from the literal fruits of their labor um and and it's kind of like a gift that we get because of course they're not um They're not being subjugated by us or they're not submitting to us in a way Um, I just like a fascinating concept and it's actually it's quite um rare right when when it comes to the human history of agriculture or the human history of um animal domestication Yes, usually the animals that have been really important to us with humans have been able to take them in um and modify them a cattle are a great example through where originally You know, there's an original Aroxin that is now extinct and that is the The ancestor of all of our modern breeds of cattle. So yes, they were wild cattle at one time and uh, but now they've been developed into a huge number of breeds uh both for dairy cows and beef cows and one thing I would like to stress is that The honey bee is incredibly Important to humans not so much for making honey by any means but for their pollination services and And that's been recently documented by this study that it had several dozen authors worldwide and they They looked it across all of the countries in the world and all of the crops grown in all of those countries and then they Um were able to get information about for the amount of each crop that's produced and for each crop what percentage Of the pollination of that crop is provided by honey bees apes molyphora and what percentage is provided by all the other bees And the estimate they came up with was that 40% of the crop pollination value Is provided by honey bees 47% of the crop pollination service worldwide Is provided by apes molyphora that one species so it is a it's a it's a species that's Extremely important to humans in ways It greatly um out far out shadow that their honey their honey their value is honey producers the makers of And I mean my assumption is that something that we didn't even realize when we were first domesticating crops and and you know and in devouring In agriculture that we kind of felt like oh this is cool We just put the seeds in the ground and then they grow And we maybe didn't really have a really good grasp of pollination back then Yeah, it was when it was done small scale the pollinators were there and In plenty just in in the invite in the natural environment today it's where we have greatly modified in the environment where we produce food In large volumes that there are not the wild areas with supporting enough wild pollinators the solitary bees as well and as well as honey bees and bumble bees So we do the honey bees and now to some extent bumble bees are the pollinators that we can Insert into the agricultural into these agricultural systems to provide the pollination Yeah, I mean, I was kind of wondering about that and maybe it's something that we can come back to later Maybe a kind of quick quick discussion about you know, obviously the way that we farm Now globally is Completely different than the way that we Farmed when we originally learned how to farm and that's simply because we have a massive population And we've had to utilize you know really sophisticated and honestly life-saving scientific techniques in an effort to To feed this growing population, you know everything from genetic modification of organisms to sophisticated fertilization techniques and things like that But it does also come with a pretty big cost, right? I mean The fact that we're not farming in these wild areas and that the organisms that would have been kind of like the Facilitator organisms aren't there.

So one of the things we're learning is adjusting Maybe fine-tuning the scale of of Of how the the scale of the fields and such to make it possible to have the pollinators there All on their own and and i'll say that of course Healthy and sustainable matter All right, so I mean obviously I think we're going to be having Quite a conversation about the the pressures and the difficulties facing the honeybees right now and you know What are some of the things that we can continue to do about that? But before we do that, I mean maybe maybe now would be the time to take a step back and talk about What honeybee is how does it live its life in the wild? What do we know about honeybees? Um, I think most people probably and Maybe maybe it's not fair for me to speak for for the vast majority of the listeners But probably you know know that they're these little Yellow and black striped organisms that we see You know around these hives and that somehow they make honey But I don't think I have and yeah, I've heard of like that there's a queen bee and that they're worker bees or drones You mentioned the the little grubs or you know the little larvae that um That are in the hive I'm not sure I fully understand the hive dynamic the family structure and um, you know How did they all work together and where does honey come from? Okay, yeah, let's start it this is right basically quick review of the basic biology of the honeybee Yeah, the honeybees I want to start by Repeating something you just mentioned that a colony of honeybees is a family It is okay The queen bee is the mother of everybody in that in the colony And the colony has workers at the which are her daughters and the colony also has drones which are the the sons of the queen and the sex determination system is that if the when a queen bee lays an egg if she fertilizes the egg by releasing some sperm onto the egg as it's being produced It will develop it'll develop into a female if the the egg is left Unfertilized it develops into a male. So and that's her call Yeah, that's her call she's got little valves where she can dose out the sperm or not and inside bees live in cavities White boxes in the case of beehives or hollow trees or caves in the wild and inside those each of one of those cavities their bees build uh beeswax combs built of beeswax that hang vertically and there these are these famous combs built with hexagonal cells Which in each cell is a can be used either for storing honey or pollen Or it can be used as a little cradle for producing the the young bees the new bees and the Typical population of a honey bee colony while the size of it would be on the order of a Oh, it would be It's typically about 40 liters, which is about 10 gallons So wow that's that that's the typical nest cavity size and the bees will build their beeswax combs in these curtains that hang vertically in the cavity and the in that cavity be it a hive or a tree hollow The upper part of the cavity is where the bees stockpiled their honey the lower half of the of the combs that they've built is where they use for their nursery area or the Young bees are produced and up within the colony The worker bees uh which are the vast vast majority of the members of the colony some 95% the other 5% being the drones Those bees they live about 30 days and as a rough Rule of thumb the first 10 days they're working as a nurse bee can rearing more bees inside the hive the next 10 days they're working as a Of a bee that's involved in mostly involved in storing the food and building the combs And the last third of the worker bees life is devoted to working outside the hive as a forge or going out and collecting the nectar Which the bees will turn into honey and the pollen that is their source of fats and proteins and they'll also collect water every living organism needs water and be colony needs water too So they so called forger bees can go out and collect water as well so and that's That's The basic structure of a honey bee colony one thing that's unique about honey bee colonies Is how they get through the winter and cold parts of the world all of the other insects When it gets cold they go into they become dormant will go into what's called diapause where they just They fill their bodies with some Antifreeze material and then they just let their bodies Chill down to and even to sub freezing temperatures Honeybees are unique honeybee colonies are unique and that they Fight the cold and all winter long inside their inside their hive or their tree cavity They're producing enough heat with their with their by using their muscles to generate heat to keep the to keep the mass of bees Warm and so there they all winter long the bees are kind of toasty warm inside their nests and incidentally that's why that is why bees store up honey It's not for our pleasure. It's The honey is their winter heating fuel they will they will burn through about Like you know quite what the numbers are but in in where I am where the winters are cold they'll burn through About 20 kilograms of or 50 pounds of honey in a winter So a couple of pounds each week and the heat production is about It's about 40 watts so it's inside a inside a Tree or a beehive it's almost as if there's a little 40 watt light bulb. It's it's burning All winter long or it's producing that much heat and the bees Cluster tightly together and they they can make a very well-insulated ball of bees so they can keep themselves warm even when it's very cold outside Oh, that's really cool. So so to be clear the honey is what they produce in order to eat and the wax is what they produce in order to kind of have like it's an engineering material It's what builds out their house. Okay, so where where do both of these things come from like how do they actually make honey and wax? Yes, let's start with the honey honey is made by the bees by going to flowers and From the flowers they collect nectar And the nectar is in the flowers because the It is a lure that the plants produce in their flowers to to cause the bees and flies and other pollinators to come and pollinate the flowers. It's the bees reward for doing that work and um, that's typically On average the the nectar in a flower is actually quite sweet. It's on average It's about 40% sugar and A bee will if you're a worker bee you'll go to lots of flowers and you'll collect a volume of this nectar you'll bring it back to the nest You'll pass it off to other bees inside the nest to or not foragers some of the middle aged bees And they will take that nectar and they will They will put it up in the honeycomb region of the nest They'll smear out the load of nectar that they've received from the forger onto the walls of the comb And then the water can evaporate out quite readily So and the what they will what they're doing is they're converting that 40% sugar solution up into us into about an 82% sugar solution That's honey That's not only for economy of space, but when When the sugar solution is that concentrated in it's um uh Bacteria and yeast cannot thrive in it the osmotic pressure is so high that the tendency to dry out things that fall into honey is so strong that uh That it is in its preserved it preserves itself very nicely Oh, yeah, and that's why you sometimes will hear people talk about the fact that Honey has these sort of antimicrobial properties. It's really just that it itself doesn't readily get infected, right? Yeah, it is antiseptic just as you said or antimicrobial because it just sucks the water out of any any microbe that is As misfortune of getting coated with honey So yeah, and it is indeed it is a it is an early Early antiseptic material or one of the earliest that humans came upon Very cool and that also explains um kind of the the process by which honey is made Explains why honey from different regions and honey from different flowering sites are different um plants Have different flavors and different properties That's right. Yeah, the flavor is um is produced not by the bees, but it's produced by the plants that And it's usually the flavors of the honey are a carryover of the fragrances that the plants have put into their flowers and nothing to their nectar to attract the bees So it is just as we have different flowers that have very different Aromas likewise the honey that comes from different plants has very different kind of aroma of honey Mm, and you'll hear them like you'll hear different honey's referred to based on those kinds of flowers or based on those clients of plants like Clover honey or like in New Zealand Manuka honey Right or yeah in North America some of the prized honey are buckwheat though some people think it smells like dirty socks And then there's a golden rod. There's yes, there's there's said probably there's probably a hundred different honey plants In North America each with its distinctive aroma and fruit and the flavor of its honey Interesting. Okay. All right, so okay starting to understand this a little bit better You've got a mom and there are some Small percentage of the hive has our boys and those male drones are there to um Basically to get mom ready to lay some eggs and um Uh, and then you've got these worker bees. Oh, just not lay eggs. Well, no mom does lay the eggs But the her sons are not going to be fertilizing her. Oh The drones produced in a colony will Uh, they will go out and mate with other queens, but it will be queens from other colonies And that that helps keep the genetics really uh diverse. Oh very cool. So it is their job to mate. That's kind of their their whole Focus in life, but they are mating with other queens That's right. That's a curious feature of the biology of honey bees it's very important that Queen mates with multiple males so that she can and her colonies endowed with great diversity genetic diversity among the colonies members that and that is That's so important because it means that the colony has a lot of different individual individuals and doubt differently for fighting different sorts of diseases and doing different sorts of jobs And so right because they're so closely um compacted together It's like constantly living on an airplane like you would just be sick all the time Yeah, that's actually a really good analogy. They're moving Yeah, they're living in space where their air is shared their food is shared Their living accommodations are shared. It's it's a parasites or pathogens Parodise almost and so The bees have to do a lot of different things another thing that they do to deal with that That risk of infections is they collect Resins that was one material I didn't mention earlier besides the nectar and the pollen and the water they go out and collect tree Resins and trees are making these resins Uh because they're antimicrobial they've put them around their buds and things before they open up to so the molds and things don't Um damage the plants themselves and the bees collect those resins and bring them in and know When they they'll coat the walls of their Nest with or hive with the resins and they will smear these resins give a light Varnish of the combs though beeswax combs as well with the varnish and that And those are these are filled with as a antimicrobial compounds that the plants are producing and that the bees make use of themselves Oh, is this the the material that sometimes used in like alternative medicine. It's called like propolis or propolis Yes, that's right. It's called propolis and And that name comes from the fact that sometimes the bees will Reduce the entrance the entrance the size of the entrance opening of their nest or hive by building a wall of it out of this tree resin And that's what Apparently the the Greeks saw that and that was propolis was a name that they they gave to the material and it means before the Oh wow Cool the hive Yeah, I love that. Oh very cool. Okay, so so we've got um We've got mom we've got drones that go out and mate with other moms We've got worker bees that have this three-tier stage of life daughters Yeah, those are the daughters and they make the wax which we'll get to in a second They make the honey they make the propolis Before we get to the wax and how it's made um, I'm wondering how does queen bee become queen bee like how does she get that distinction versus just becoming a regular worker bee Yeah Or to say that even more precisely how does you take an egg that's been Honey bee egg and it's that it's been fertilized that that's going to produce a female and the question is what determines whether that egg? Develops into a queen or that egg develops into a worker and it's it This is a long standing mystery and I don't know as we fully understand them the mechanism But it has entirely to do with the environment in which the egg develops if it's if the larva hatches out of an egg and it and it is lavishly Fed with a material called royal jelly then it will develop into a queen if it gets just a smidgen of royal jelly and And then it develops into a worker So it's all it's all about what how a fertilized egg which will destined to make a female what it's how it's fed To queen your worker Veteran owned and operated the bearded Viking meat crew is reinventing the ancient art of meat making with a modern twist They're award-winning needs are handcrafted with high-quality ingredients offering a rich variety of flavors that range from bold and fruity to smooth and traditional Whether you're sitting there classic OG or enjoying creative blends like choked cherry vanilla or jalapeno raspberry There's something for every palate with a commitment to quality and flavor the bearded Viking meat company focuses on creating good times for a great meetup To bring family and friends together so visit bearded Viking dot com today to explore their collection and get ready for your next meetup Visit modo.us for the best free place social casino experience wherever you are Moto offers a huge selection of biggest style games and now introducing live blackjack roulette and casino hold them these are so much fun Modo always has generous jackpots free spins and exciting promotions register today at modo.us for your free welcome bonus Moto was a social casino no purchase necessary void were prohibitive play responsibly conditions apply see website Hello Dot us All right guys, let's get back to the show Whoa, and then is the outcome you know, we know a queen by its um behavior by its role is it also Physically or physiologically different than worker bees? Yeah, it's both, you know both physically more felt and that's more Philanjically and and physiologically very different. It's the weight of a queen is about I think it's about 150% the weight of a worker bee so she's bigger and bulkier and what's most striking about her is that Queen is that her abdomen is bulging with what are Ovarules The structures that produce the eggs Whereas in a worker there just the workers do have a couple of these egg lane tubes in their in their abdomens, but they're generally they're They're inactive whereas a queen will have several hundred and so she can lay and so she's a really productive egg let egg producer A queen bee can lay more than a thousand eggs in a day And when you think about it, that's you just go through this simple math You can see why she has to lay so many if if a colony is going to have 30,000 bees and each bee only lives 30 days you're going to have to rear a thousand bees a day to keep that 2000 colony going so it's quite a it's quite an operation Oh my gosh, and what what happens when when mama bee when queen bee dies like are there other bees that are like next in line? Yeah, what what usually happens and Though it's actually not with the topic that's a stole a bit mysterious Somehow the worker bee sense when when their mother queen is starting to senes They will take steps to rear replacement and And so and then so in colonies it's sometimes a beekeeper working through his or her hives We'll see there's two queens in that hive and that's mom and one of the daughters Wow, the successor working side by side so the colony is potentially um Potentially immortal in that because of that of that mechanism Ah, that's so neat. Oh my gosh, I'm learning so much. This is so exciting. Okay, so the the the kind of last component that we didn't get to I mean, there's a million things we haven't gotten to yet But in terms of the structure and the function is the actual wax itself. So we know how the yeah Honey is made is what is the wax made out of? The wax um is made out of the sugars that the bees consume and inside they're in in the bodies of worker bees There are special glands in their in their abdiments in the bottom of their abdiments The series of plates called wax glands Where they can take the carbohydrate from the sugars and convert it into wax um and wax is some It's just a different it's a it's a different kind of organic chemical than sugar So they have to do a lot of fancy Organic chemistry inside their body to make these wax molecules and they the bees produce them as little Be in be lower. They're called mere um little wax flakes or scales and on the bottom of a worker bees body There are eight of these little Structures and so each bee can can turn out eight wax scales at a time And then they they come out like a little sliver um and they they then will Be that's making wax will grab them with their hind leg and pass it to her mid-like to her foreleg and then into It's where she can then work it with her forelegs and her mandibles and make that little Sheat little um plate lid of wax that she produced each one into a ball of wax and then add that to wherever the colony is Building its comb so the the bees that are building the comb are Not only shaping the building material, but they're also producing the building material itself That's so cool and of course the wax like you know we we talk about honey when we talk about honey bees because You know that's what we think of first we've even called them that honey bees But the wax is also a vital kind of commercial product for for human use as well, isn't it? You know, I don't know a terrible you large amount about that, but its beeswax has its certainly has historically had its place um It was one of the very early kinds of plastic materials humans had Um for sealing things up um for for making cosmetics um It was often used for um source of light the Catholic Church was famous for its use of Preferring to use beeswax candles and uh So yeah, it is it's a it's it is a one of the original such plastic-y type materials It's been largely superseded by artificial plastics these days That's really really interesting, you know, so so all of this kind of structure and function that we've been talking about and and this kind of innate organization Is this all specific to only honey bees and follow up? Is the honey bee like one species is it multiple species what percentage of all bees are honey bees? Interesting question um there are See I think there's about 15,000 species maybe it's up to 20,000 species of of bees worldwide And yes, my colleague and entomology department here at Cornell Bryan Danforth he could answer that question very precisely I'm sure any of it so let's say it's 20,000 there are 10 species of honey bees worldwide these are the 10 species in the genus A-bis that's honey bee genus So wow 10 divided by 20,000 that's like you know some oh yeah exactly Very small percentage of the world's bee species are are honey bee species that said as we as we've talked about in terms of their numerosity their abundance they they're they're heavy hitters in the sense that as we talked about of the pollinators and In producing our food nearly 50% of the pollination service is provided by this Our is provided by apis molyphar just one of those species of honey bee so There aren't a lot of honey bee species, but there are a lot of honey bees Oh, wow okay, and apis so you said apis is the genus the genus and then there are about 10 species within that genus That's right. That's right And which is the one that you said molyphar what what's it called? molyphara that means molyphara yeah that means It's that molyphara means is Latin for honey honey carrying bee Should have been and it was just a Just the person who named it got had his Latin a little bit wrong. It should have been molyphica He wanted to say the honey maker Yeah, so it should have said molyphica Fica molyphara So just that's a little that's a little awkwardness in our Nomenclature about honey bees their their names for being honey carriers and they don't really carry honey They may honey So their name's oh my gosh, that's so funny. I love that and is that I'm just googling it right now That's what we what we would also refer to as the western honey bee Yes, that's right. That is the Mopipus molyphara is the honey bee whose range includes Europe Western Asia and Africa and if you go east of those regions Then you'll you'll come into the other nine species of honey bees when you go into um eastern Asia um and Yeah, then you will get into the other nine species the range of the other nine species of honey bees And what about in the US? We had We historically we did not have honey bees living in the Americas Recently a fossil was found of a honey bee that did live in um in the Americas But that was about seven to million years ago and apparently it came across And then it did big win extinct during a cooling period, but uh it came across from Asia Just like ourselves just like humans it came across the bearing a land bridge I'm in the bearing bearing Straight region and uh but then it and it this fossil was found in the lava. It's a beautiful fossil It's very clear. It's a worker honey bee, but it it Visit modo.us for the best replay social casino experience wherever you are Modo offers a huge selection of biggest style games with free spins exciting promotions and always generous jackpots You can waste your time with the others or you can win at modo register today at modo.us for your free welcome bonus Modo was a social casino.

That's a rich topic for scholarship That's interesting. So even though they are wild here in the US. They were actually introduced so in a way There are kind of an invasive species Yes, they invaded Humans introduced them and shortly after and they they were brought in the they were brought in ships sailing ships during the winter from Europe England to North America and they were living in what are called scaps these straw hives and Once the colonies once they got here they did very very well in the eastern United States. It's uh it was just The Eastern United States with its deciduous forest is much like their homeland in Europe in fact Europe and North America used to be one continent together So we have what we share a lot of plants and so forth and so when when the breeds were honey bees were introduced to North America They they would go through their normal biology of casting swarms and those swarms moved into the woods and they spread And you can now I talk about in my book a very nice study a gentleman did krizky Where he went back through the diaries and letters of early settlers and he could and just looking for any mention of people going Getting honey out of trees and whatnot and he was able to document the spread Over 150 years from the east coast the eastern seaboard in the US Over to the Mississippi River and that that's pretty fast actually So uh, so they they took to North America Just very very well and and they were also introduced to South America and Central America So now the honey bee lives in throughout the new world Interesting and obviously really took over a lot of those kind of pollinating Rolls that maybe some of the other organisms were were filling in prior to that. I guess I'm interested to know you know, we talked about these really unique dynamics of Of honey bee life Are those are aspects of those common to other species of bees as well But they just don't make honey or like do other species of bees even live in hives Most the vast majority of 99.9% of the other species of honey bees are what we would call solitary bees They their their life cycle is Very individualistic you have a female that emerges in the That will Get made it at some point during the year and then she will build a nest on her own It could be in the ground or it could be in a hollow stem And she'll rear a little family in there and then she then she leaves them and she goes off and dies and then make They will emerge the next summer and so that's that's how their lives work And that's the vast majority we call that's what we call them solitary. They lead largely solitary lives Just a female cave having made it caring for a nest with with a with a number of young and now There are a few other species that are that are social Uh in North America. They're the bumblebees and then in South America Middle and Central America and in Africa. There's a whole other group of Bees that are a kind of honey bee, but we call them stingless bees. They also like are like the familiar honey bees they They live in colonies groups and they store up honey to have a food reserve but um And they're very diverse and gives about 500 species of them But they don't they don't get much much press in North America. They because they don't live here That they get they're very um fascinating and very um compelling Behaviorally compelling social bees, but um we just don't hear much about them because we don't see them. We don't have them here And what about non honey bees? Just what we think of as like regular bees that 20,000 species that you talked about before Are they so shold? Do they have some of these same kinds of um Lifestyles some um They're very diverse in terms of their most styles none of them have the large colonies and um that we have in in In honey bees a pismolephora There are some there are a few species in which there's a little overlap of a couple of females several females will work together and share a nest And so there's social in that sense and we have the bumblebees where The those bumblebees are truly social like honey bees, but their colonies are not as large And when I say truly social I mean that they have a queen Who makes a nest and has Daughters that stay with her and don't reproduce but are her helpers just like in honey bees So bumblebees are the closest Um in terms of their social biology or the closest to honey bees But their their colonies are small and um they're very Very well adapted to cold cooler climates They don't over winter by storing a punny and keeping warm all winter long. They instead with bumblebees. It's the The queens produced at the end of one summer um burrow down into the ground below frost level I think and um and then we'll Spend the winter in solitude and then pop out in the spring and start things over So Tom correct me if I'm wrong I mean obviously you have dedicated your life to learning about honey bees and their You know fascinating Ecology they're fascinating physiology uh, you know, there's there's so many aspects of it There the how social they are is that not Like just unique among organisms. I mean it seems to me especially among insects that it's such a sophisticated um uh strategy for You know maintaining the species that i mean it's almost hard to believe when you really start to dig into it Yeah, you know you've put your finger on a really important point and um So I'll answer I want to address a couple of thoughts that bubbled up when you were just Raising this point one is that um first of all yes the the fascination of honey bees is there is their Sociology that what they are what I would call beautifully social insects and that is also this secret To their success they can they can thanks to their Social system they can get through cold winters they can stock stockpile food they can thwart enemies They can yeah they do all these very very ups lead these very sophisticated lives however They are not the only highly social insects by any means in fact The they're um if we shift from away from bees over to ants and the other mate other major group of uh and Social insects there we find Even me might have to say even more spectacular animal insects societies Um and those have been so beautifully described by Erudal Wilson and Beard Houdoupler in in their books and so they've devoted their lives to the study of ants as I've done devoted mine to study of bees I love that and you guys have been able to to share those stories with you know with people like us like myself and those who are listening who Obviously um may not you know we can we can watch them we can watch nature documentaries about them We can spend time near them But may not ever have the kind of appreciation That you have because you're studying them from so many different angles So it's like a real honor to be able to learn about them through your work Thank you.

I mean one thing that makes it so amazing Is their ability to communicate it's the only insect that? Where an individual can Give another individual Instructions to say go out Go out to that location and here's the instructions go to that Direction and that distance and you'll find a rich food source um That's there's only the only other species that can do that is is honeybee in ourselves and maybe and maybe some osprey's but um That kind of thing makes it makes it really um just Utterly fascinating for me and and for all of the other people that are Study bees either professionally or as a beekeeper and there's lots and lots of People that have been captivated by the bees and so captivated they they keep them in their backyards in their hives Yeah, I mean that's that's incredible and how what is their language based on obviously is not linguistic language But what how how what is their communication style is it through um Dance Yeah, that's right. Don't say to go isn't dancing. It is called the waggle dance and it is perfect It's performed in this inside the nest by a bee that is found a rich source of pollen or nectar or or water at the colony's thirsty and It's a little car to explain in words without it making a drawing but basically she does a She does a ritualized reenactment of her flight out to the flower patch on Inside the nest on the combs and so She involves her walking forward on the combs and she can indicate the distance by how long She walks forward while making a buzzing sound with her with her wings So the greater the distance the longer each Each run of her what we call the waggle dance lasts so That waggle run can last From a fraction of a second up to several seconds and then so that can code the distance and then how she indicates the direction Is by how she the angle she's doing the dance on a vertical surface the side of one of these curtains of comb in the nest and if she if she's does it doing her wagling motion Or her dance while she's walking straight up that she's telling the other bees that the target of flowers that she's She's indicating is in the direction of whatever direction the sun currently is So he's yeah, so it's it is remarkable. It's it really is a unique um abstract form of communication and When it was discovered it was so striking The the original person who discovered a gentleman named very good scientist named Caravan Frisch in Germany He he didn't fully understand it himself for 20 years He thought he sort of had a these I wouldn't say blinders on but he he assumed that the bees were doing something much simpler than they were But finally he was did some experiments that revealed to them. Oh these bees In their communication system they have words for distance and direction and then he looked closely and he figured out how it how it works So yeah, it is it's that kind of social Beauty of social life which which is compelling to me and I think it's compelling to to most um Most beekeepers and other bee by all honey bee biologists Oh, it's absolutely incredible and of course, you know You mentioned previously that the sociality and um and really the communication um That's unique is also really the key to their success as a species and and that they have been quite a successful species Accounting for you know almost half of of pollination that said we also know that human Activities as is so often the case are really threatening the honey bee right now So I would love to maybe take the the last bit of our chat to talk about what some of the the threats that these organisms Might be facing what's the difference between the threats that kept bees are dealing with versus what's going on in the wild and kind of what can we What can we learn from from these bees? Yeah, that's these and you've put your finger on her are really subject regarding the human honey bee human being honey bee Relationship right now we're doing we're doing a number of things that Oh With the bees that are living under our management and beekeepers hives we're doing a number of things that are making life harder and harder for these these beautiful bees One is is very is very simply described we're spreading poisons in the environment Using lots of pesticides in the fields where the bees are brought to do their pollination work And that's it that's it that's a deadly combination of bringing bees in and then spraying the fields Um insecticides these would be spraying in You know orchards and things like that. So That's one one combination another is that We're we've introduced um some parasites Particularly a little might from an asian species of honey bee was introduced To the european and african species of honey bee and this little might Is very good at transmitting the bees viruses. It's a great vector for for some nasty viruses at the bees And that's that's been a that's probably been Equally bad killer of honey bee colonies both managed colonies and wild colonies Um, so that's another thing that we've we've done to make life hard for honey bees and then there's a Alongstanding aspect of the human being honey bee relationship is that we've always been uh unintentionally in it and and and thus inadvertently um We've been making life hard for them by just putting them in hives and managing the colonies to be very productive of honey um complicated topic, but there's a lot of things About the life of of a honey bee colony that are made more difficult When they're living under human human management. Here's just one example beekeepers for and i'm a beekeeper for our convenience we put the We put our hives together in groups which are called apiary so beards And that's convenient for the human being but for the bees it's it's not so great Because it means if one colony gets sick the illness the pathogen or parasite that's causing that illness spreads Easily to the other colonies which it can be just a few feet away So that's not that's not good for the bees and that's very different from how they live in the wild where they're usually living about Half a mile apart from between one hollow tree housing to be colony and another So Another is that we As we so often do with agricultural animals we We manipulate them to be Extremely productive for the things that we want in the case of honey bees. Guess what that is. It's honey Yeah, a lot of the a lot of the um technology and uh Skill of beekeeping or trade of beekeeping is making honey bee colonies into very large units having the colonies Grow to a larger size than they would in nature instead of growing to 20 or 30,000 to they grow up to 60,000 or even more bees So they have a huge workforce so they can make and then they will make up make store up lots and lots of honey so that and that Means that the colonies are even more prone to diseases because they're They've got all these resources inside them for the parasites and pathogens to exploit So that's another thing that we do and then another third thing one that we see very dramatically Visit modo.us for the best free place social casino experience wherever you are Moto offers a huge selection of vagastile games and now introducing live blackjack roulette and casino hold them.

It's being trucked thousands and thousands of miles Gosh, I had no idea I knew almonds were like really intensive when it came to water usage And that that was always something that was like I don't know if almond milk is the best alternative But I had no idea what kind of impact almond farming had on bees. Yeah, almond pollen almond production is not only water intensive. It's be intensive Needs every every flower if it's gonna make a fruit or seed and a nut Establet pollinator Show up and move the pollen from one one in plant to another So yeah, it's it's it's really hard All beekeepers love their bees, but they don't always They're not every action that beekeepers take is is what you would have to say is a loving or caring action Even though and that's something we're just starting to realize because one of the curious things about honey bees and bees and beekeeping is that It's only in about the last few decades that we've known anything about the natural lives of bees See beekeepers beekeepers develop hives that is starting thousands of years ago as we talked about And we've never and once people once human beings got bees and hives Then they focused on their lives of the bees and the hives and how to manipulate them and how to You know, I get to say honestly Exploite the lives of these bees living in the in the beekeepers hives where those could be boxes or scepts Whatever Log hives whatever so our focus is Almost every beekeepers focus has always been on the bees living in his or her hive Which it's very unnatural and so now we're we've gone back and and looked at how bees are living and And when will Barry put it really nicely? I'll paraphrase what one of his famous quotes and he was referring to agricultural practices in general He says we've never really known what we were doing because we've never known what we were undue And we only can know what we're undoing if we would see what nature is doing if we were doing nothing And that's For bees and beekeeping beekeepers have not we don't know what we're doing to the bees because we haven't known what we're undoing because we didn't know what their natural lives were like But that's that's what I and others have been looking at intensively for Say say for the past about 40 years now And that really ultimately is kind of the thesis of of your notebook the lives of bees the untold story Of the honey bee in the wild because in understanding kind of the success the success of this species in the wild We can actually learn from them and maybe apply some of those strategies that have been you know honed by Hundreds of thousands millions of years um and utilize them in in our beekeeping Yeah, we I think that's I think that's right and that's one of the things I The ideas that I present in this book it's not going to be this idea of letting bees live more naturally probably will not Well certainly will not apply to the commercial beekeeper with thousands or tens of thousands of hives of bees, but it's very relevant to the To the hobby beekeeper that might have a handful of colonies Where they can let them they don't need the high production. They're not trucking their colonies around They can be they can give the bees Let them live kinder gentler lives And so that's yes, I think that's a one of the positive aspects of the of this uh Growing body of knowledge of the natural lives of bees and most beekeepers are small scale beekeepers are hobbyists and they they have the bees interests First and foremost that's for them. It's a lot like I like to like to compare the what I see is that two kinds of beekeeping and it's like the difference but one on the one hand you've got the small scale beekeeper And on the other hand, you've got the large commercial and it's much like the difference between people that enjoy watching birds or birdwatchers and people that grow birds for Eggs and pull eggs and meat and you know, poultry farming and I think there's room for there's certainly room for both of those approaches and they're very different They're very different and And they're both I think they're both valid but we have to recognize that There is there are these two ways of working with the bees not just Not just managing them for maximum honey production or maximum pollination value But but it's perfectly valid to to enjoy a colony of bees just as a as a living system. It is beautiful in its own right Even if it makes no honey produces only its pollination inadvertent Yeah, they are intrinsically fascinating just being themselves And of course you you've shared those stories so beautifully In your book Thomas um Tom sorry before we before we wrap up this chat, you know, I I close every episode of my show by asking my guests the same Two questions and they're sort of Big picture questions, so You can obviously take a moment to think about your answers But I would really love for you to weigh in especially considering the unique perspective that you That you bring to the conversation so okay if you're ready here they come Number one when you think about the future in whatever context is kind of relevant to you It could be contextualized by the work that you do by you know where you are along the developmental process of life It could be a personal thing Vocational thing even a cosmic thing number one What is the thing that really does keep you up the most at night the thing that you're most worried about Maybe you're getting to be borderline. I don't know pessimistic cynical You know something something that you're like this is not okay and on the flip side of that what is the thing that if you had to pick one That you're like genuinely authentically Actually optimistic about you're you're very much looking forward to Well, the first one's easier because it's so obvious. It's just the pervasive damage to our planet loss of water rising temperatures pollution With pesticides and everything else Yeah, so that's that's the one that keeps me up at night. I mean, I just I'm almost 70 years old and I can just see it. It's so obvious when I was a kid the fields were filled with insects And now they're not you go out and eat summer evening. I think it would be a symphony of insects And now you just don't you don't see that you don't hear that don't see that What gives me hope or optimism? What gives me hope and optimism is knowledge? We're learning more and more about what where we're going wrong and that's of course the first step Knowing what we're doing Knowing what we're undoing is the first step towards I think to getting it getting it back to figuring out what how to how to stop doing that and and be more benign to our To our planet and thus ultimately to ourselves and to our to our children Absolutely what a beautiful and elegant response to those questions.
