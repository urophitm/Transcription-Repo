Hello everyone and welcome to Talk Nerdy. Today is Monday, December 11th and I'm your host, Cara Santa Maria. I'm really excited about this week's guest. Honestly, he has been really influential in my work and I think a lot of other individuals who have ever studied neuroscience, neuroendocrinology or even biology kind of writ large, no of Dr. Robert Sapolsky. This one I actually have been holding on to for quite a while. I had some editing issues but now I'm working with a new editor. So I'm really excited that I can finally unveil this short but very sweet episode. All right, before we dive into it, I want to thank those of you who make Talk Nerdy possible each and every week.

All right guys, I know I said I'm really excited. I say I'm really excited a lot but this one I feel like if you read why Zebra's don't get ulcers when you were in school you would know why I'm so excited. Dr. Robert Sapolsky, he is the John A and Cynthia Fry gun professor at Stanford University. He's an endocrinologist, a neuroendocrinologist but he actually holds appointments in a lot of departments there. Biology, neurology, neurological sciences, neurosurgery and he's done a lot of work as well as a primatologist. His new book is called Behave, the biology of humans at our best and our worst. All right guys, without any further ado, here he is Dr. Robert Sapolsky. Well Robert, thank you so much for joining me today. Glad to be here. I am incredibly excited to talk about your new book Behave, the biology of humans at our best and worst. And I have to make a small admission and that is that as a student of psychology, like most students of psychology, I read about your work in my textbooks and I read why Zebras don't get ulcers and when I was first offered the opportunity to talk to you about your newest book I had to jump at the chance because it's not often you get to sit down with somebody who helped shape your undergrad and also your graduate career. So I thank you for that. Well thank you that also makes me feel very old but you know, you're that? It wasn't that long ago. I mean it was actually quite a while ago but don't feel a little, don't feel a little. Don't rub it in. So this new book, the subtitle is the biology of humans at our best and our worst. And the idea here is a deep dive into some of the more nuanced and complicated aspects of human relationships really more than anything. What made you want to tackle this almost impossible topic? Well this could have sound borderline gluitional but I've actually been planning this book since I was an undergraduate where it struck me, you know, when learning, if you want to make sense, a human behavior, where you've got to incorporate neurons and genes and hormones and culture and evolution and all that stuff and it just sort of struck me that at some point it might be fun to try to write that all up. Absolutely and I'm sure it took a very full career to be able to gain most of the insights that are necessary and your career is stunningly multidisciplinary. I don't think it's very often in the sciences that we see somebody who has worked in such, what I think of as quite different fields but of course you've managed to relate them between doing kind of the neuroendow work that the hormone and neuroscience and neurochemistry work but also even some primatology. Yeah, I think this basically reflects that for many decades I haven't quite been able to decide if I'm a field primatologist or a lab neurobiologist so fortunately I've been able to oscillate between the two. I love that and I think that a lot of young people listening who are maybe in the sciences trying to figure out where they want to go in the sciences will be comforted by the fact that you can do the things that interest you and you can forge your own path and make a really solid career out of it and of course all of that work has contributed to this wonderful volume so let's dive into this book. I think kind of the first question that a lot of people ask which you make a pretty solid point is almost the wrong way to look at it is do I do this because of nature or because of nurture? Yes and I think by now I mean here's a phrase which like to get a license to teach the sort of stuff I'd say this phrase about once an hour which is to talk about gene environment interactions it doesn't make any sense to ask what a gene does only what it does in a particular environment and it doesn't make any sense to ask what the effects are some environment instead to ask what its effects are with somebody with their particular genotype and they interact wonderfully they interact utterly and as soon as we get into the trenches I've trying to figure out so what about this particular bee it's just really hard to hold on to the fact that they're just completely utterly intertwined? Absolutely and you know we can look at like you mentioned the exact same genotype often we can do this in laboratory studies with mice for example because we're dealing with cloned animals that are genetically identical and put them in grossly different environments and they are completely different creatures and you can see the same in humans as well and slightly less controlled experiments for example there's this gene jargon that's called an MAO alpha monocidase alpha and that's got something to do with brain chemistry and it comes in a couple of different flavors a couple of different variants and it turns out if you have one of those variants you are significantly more prone towards sort of adult anti-social violence if and only if you were abused as a child if you weren't if you weren't raised in an abusive environment having this genetic variant has no effect whatsoever oh what is this gene to it depends on what your childhood was like interesting and it does seem to be the case that in other examples that are maybe a little less severe than anti-social behavior childhood difficulty can have lasting lasting effects you know neglect abuse exposure to atrocities these kinds of things can have all sorts of ramifications later in life absolutely and I would say the three most interesting things that emerged in that area about childhood adversity and you know footnote in this whole field environment adverse or not to get a birth a huge amount of this is also occurring in fetal environment yes the first one is well Dutch childhood matters that influences the adult that you are we're actually learning a huge amount about the molecular biology of how those early experiences change the gene regulation in this one little corner of your brain forever after so we're understanding mechanistically how it works second and we're understanding in circumstances where this could be multi-generational where childhood experience influences the sort of adult you are in a way that will replicate that experience for your own children producing the same sort of epigenetically mediated adulthood passed on generationally the third one those just as you're about to get all pessimistic and throw up your hands that inevitability early childhood adversity and that's that you're up to creek forever well we're all also learning is virtually none of that stuff is set at stone all of those things in some ways are reversible problem of course the longer you wait until battle it is yeah it does seem like if there's ever a time to be resilient and ever a time to have that intervention work it is also in childhood and sort of outcomes from therapeutic interventions and the like can be dramatic with with children who have suffered abuse or these other atrocities although like you said the longer that you wait the more ingrained these things become the more likely they are to be passed on both in that nurture and that nature kind of like we said inextricably linked way of course this does seem to be the source the fuel the ammo for things like racism well yeah and I think with that we we sort of approach one of the great sort of paradoxes and understanding sort of the biology behavior the best way to buy a car is the Werner way you'll find more value every day at Werner Hyundai that's more style more comfort and more warranty test drive the 2025 Hyundai Santa

with rugged good looks advanced technology and luxury if you haven't already made the switch to Werner Kia now's the best time get all the details at Werner Kia dot com is we're incredibly prone towards dividing the world into us and them and we do it automatically we do it with it in milliseconds parts of our brain have already done it before we're even consciously aware of the who we're looking at and our brain already is processing some of these key differences along lines of race, gender, age, status, signals, things of that sort and what do you know consistently when we divide the world into us and them so we're not thrilled about the thems and we're rotten to them and certain circumstances so whoa that looks again totally depressing in terms of some inevitability is there where the paradox is is while we're incredibly I think almost inevitably prone towards making these us some dichotomies it's incredibly easy to manipulate us as to who counts as in us and who counts as a them and manipulate things properly and of them one second ago becomes an us and a completely different categorization two seconds later we're constantly shifting which particular us them divide is dominating our thoughts and emotions yeah it is interesting how incredibly arbitrary that in group out group line in the sand can be I mean obviously there are some things that evolutionarily seem more salient you know do you look like me do you speak the same languages I do you know are there things about my culture that that show that we we are from the same and we are not from the same whereas so many of those distinctions in modern global society are just completely artificial you know these like maybe less so the political distinctions because it does seem to be the case that there are some actual physiological differences between people of different ideological paths but so many as you said of these distinctions are kind of just situationally bound absolutely and their signal in which group you have this membership in is signaled by incredibly arbitrary stuff like you're describing somebody if you have a certain bent you'll say well guy would see and you say oh you know he's one of those like a cost shirt guys that carries a world of implications or like you look at two people an example I sort of look at in the book look at two people from like a hundred yards away with your pair of binoculars and the only thing you're able to see is one of them is wearing a stats and hat and the other one is wearing like a navy jacket and you already have a pretty good chance of the knowing sort of deep values which one of them think that cows are good for eating and which one thinks the cows are good for praying too yeah oh interesting yeah and that really will resonate and kind of color all of the decisions and thoughts and behaviors that you have with regards to your interaction with those two individuals doesn't it absolutely and what we wind up sort of reflecting there is we're not very good at recognizing who's and who's of them in normal animal ways and fear typical social mammal out there us is somewhat synonymous with related to you and it's a matter just how much of a degree of lateness you share and all sorts of other species can innately recognize relatedness by ceremonial signals things of that sort we don't do that we have to think we have to think who feels so much like a relative that we feel highly affiliated with them who feels so distant and different from us that it hardly even counts when you say kill them pseudo kinship pseudo-speciation and we're using constant signals for that and as a great example consider sort of inner city gangs and such what color you wear is enough of a signal to determine who you kill and who you would give your life up for defending yeah it's interesting this idea of these kind of labels these signals that can be just as simple as you know abandon and your back pocket you talk a lot in the book about symbols about this ability to utilize kind of these artificial symbols as as cues for that dividing line and and really these gross and intense behavioral decisions we're willing to make based on symbols the idea of killing somebody over a symbol or giving your own life over a symbol to me seems so dramatic it's very easy you know as you're reading about these things to take a step back and say well I would never do that I don't think that way but that's just a part of who we are isn't it absolutely and I think it reflects another paradox about our behavior of which there's many which is like we humans 40 50 thousand years ago evolve as amazing cognitive capacity for symbols and metaphors and parables and things standing and for other things and you throw a bunch of pigment on the wall of a cave and it's a picture of an animal in your cave this is like spectacular and then paradoxically our brain tundle in a way that are totally primitive in an accurate say specifically um you feel somebody's pain you feel someone else's pain that's a metaphor that yet there's a part of the brain where there's some neurons there that cannot distinguish between you feeling pain and empathic pain or you feel utterly disgusted at somebody's like morally appalledly behavior and another region of the brain there's neurons that don't distinguish between moral disgust and you've just bitten into some rancid rotten food or the version I find so amazing there's like this ancient party or brain that does like basic plumbing it tells you something about your body temperature are you hot or you cold yet those some same neurons back when we invented one type of metaphor somehow got who scoured into they also mediate whether you think somebody has a warmer cold personality and with a wine's a meaning is our brains not very accurate alert we're like not quite sure am I disgusted because I just put a whole bunch of toxic food in my mouth or am I disgusted because this person looks different from me lives differently prays loves differently for me what we wind up seeing is where you get the steam to be willing to kill or die for some of these metaphorical things oh that's fascinating yeah and it kind of makes I guess evolutionary conservational sense right that these different brain regions would have these kind of dual purposes that operate on different levels but one really is I guess a physical level and one is this kind of secondary like you said metaphorical emotional thoughtful level and to be able to not tell the difference between the two could absolutely wreak havoc on our individual behavior it makes me wonder though is there a significant difference or have you come across anything in your research for the book or in your writings between these empathic abilities these these abilities to I guess think on a less tangible concrete level between women and men because it is difficult when you look through the historical picture at war and you notice that there is a strong male bent to the war of a of a group yeah that that does kind of pop up in the historical records and of course what it raises is just a little bit with your baboon or a human or gecko or most anything and that one's complicated and of course because the easiest sort of niche birch explanation to everyone has is oh testosterone testosterone that's that hormone that accounts for an incredible percentage of like the world's misery in terms of making males such a total violent pains but no when you look more closely for one thing it turns out testosterone doesn't cause aggression what it does is it amplifies pre-existing social tendencies towards aggression for example you know pump up some liberal ranking male monkey with a ton of testosterone and he doesn't start challenging the high ranking guys in the group you know normally power and front he just becomes a totally violent miserable knife to all the guys he already has the social sanctioned ability you just amplifying the pre-existing signal there but what's most interesting though is it turns out testosterone and male aggression is even subtler than that and this taps into an idea that's called the challenge hypothesis it's not so much that testosterone influences aggression it's that testosterone boosts up whatever behaviors are needed in order to protect your status when it's being challenged okay what does that mean if you're a baboon if your status is being challenged 99% of the time you're going to maintain it with aggression challenge holding onto status aggression are absolutely synonymous but you get humans and it's very different because say you can put somebody in economic game where you gain status from being generous in your offerings and amazingly give people testosterone and they become more generous in their play in that game in other words like take a whole bunch of Buddhist monks and shoot them up with tons of testosterone and they're just going to run on the mock trying to do acts of random kindness and what then winds up telling us is the problem isn't that testosterone causes aggression the problem is that we hand out so damn much status for the right types of aggression interesting does it have this same effect on women as it has on men yep and in lots of ways the testosterone story uh it doesn't cause aggression and amplify the preaches can tend to little inter individual difference right and see crest here when you have a busy schedule it's important to maximize your downtime one of the best

The fact that I've got a little more testosterone today than that guy does or than I had yesterday predicts virtually nothing about behavior all that applies to females as well because it turns out the female mammals make a certain amount of testosterone related hormones and origins and from the adrenal gland adrenal androgens and remarkably they have rich small some of the same behavioral effects and with a whole lot of the wait a second let's not get too simplistic about androgens take home message as in males. Interesting that that is really interesting this idea that it amplifies things that are already there because I do think we have an oversimplified view and a shorthand that testosterone equals aggression and testosterone equals violence and strength and control and power but these are maybe more socially but also evolutionarily kind of ingrained behaviors that that just exist in certain individuals and all the testosterone does is is is amplify those that's that's fascinating. I would love to talk a little bit about politics simply because I think that you know now is the time if ever there were a time to talk about these differences. Yeah the news cycle. The news cycle is at their best at first. Absolutely. The news cycle is not disappointing within the last few weeks months and your discussion of these two groups you know whether one is an in-group to you or an out-group to you or you're somewhere in between we say conservatives progressives we might say liberals and conservatives. Some people like to talk about Democrats and Republicans although I think that that's a little bit too narrow when we talk about this sort of continuum and of course there's a lot of things in between libertarians for example. These the ways that we identify at this kind of very deep level are not arbitrary are they they're not just oh these are my friends this is how I grew up and so I kind of decided to think along these lines they really go down to something that's much deeper within us. Well it's one of those it immediately taps into one of the great sort of inevitable debates of these things is how much do we think how much do we reason our way to our opinions actions such versus how much do we feel our way to them and one of the big themes that's been coming through in behavioral biology is often it's your feelings they're pulling your thinking by the nose how much feelings are coming first and the thinking is rationalization's post-hoc to sort of make it all seem sensical. What you see in the political realm is it turns out there's fairly consistent differences between progresses and conservatives in how they feel about if you tend to find novelty to be anxiety-provoking if you find ambiguity to be particularly scary that's a major predictor that your sort of political views are going to be ones that are on the conservative side. On the other hand if novelty is exciting exhilarating you're more likely to be a progressive. If various things ranging from the notion of somebody living very differently from you to looking at say a festering wound filled with maggots if those are really really easily making you feel you're more likely to be a social conservative. If instead you have a high threshold for finding things disgusting you're more likely to be a social progressive and what's amazing in those cases is these just have to do with sort of viscer have to do with what things make you anxious that you're not even aware of and what that winds up meaning is use of a shift people's political views by implicitly manipulating some of that visceral stuff. This is one of my all-time favorite studies that sort of I white upside think in the book which is put somebody in a room where unbeknownst to them they are being sort of marinate the smell of rotten garbage and people become become more politically conservative. You're sitting there just feeling disgusted feeling disgusted. They're neurons that do custatory and olfactory disgust that do moral disgust and it fills in a vacuum. Whoa those neurons are firing like see it must be because they they not only do different things than I do but those different things are disgusting and deplorable and morally condemned and you become more conservative about social issues doesn't touch your views about economics about geopolitical stuff it just serves how much of to see making is just rumbling with viscera and sort of biology we never even suspect just going on under the surface there. You know that's fascinating too especially the point that you made about how it touches your your opinions about social issues but less so about geopolitical issues or economic issues because of course we know that all of those things feed in to our political kind of identities and identifications yet politicians and probably more specifically campaign managers for politicians have a very good understanding of the fact that manipulating the constituency on social issues has a good outcome for their candidates. You see so often that the campaign is all about social issues whereas these other things that are super salient and necessary to make a determination about a candidate and whether or not they're ideologically aligned just don't get talked about very much because they're not inflammatory in the same way my my guess is there's probably nobody in this country who's willing to get into a fist fight with somebody over our trade policy with the Swaziland for example yeah obviously with social issues gave rights abortion all the all the usual hot button topics obviously intensely inflammatory another interesting realm with that in terms of political decisions is when we make our decisions who we vote for it turns out there's all this subliminal stuff going on we're more likely to vote for candidates who are better looking who have more symmetrical faces who are taller who have square jaw jaws if they're male if all sorts of things like that and another one of those amazing studies sufficiently so take a bunch of five-year-olds and show them pictures of two people who were candidates in some election in some other Western country and say so you're on a you're on a voyage and a boat and you're going to scary places and stuff and which of these people would you like to be the captain of your ship and 75% of the time five-year-olds picked the person who won the election knowing nothing more than what this person's face looks like in other words on some implicit level when we're making our decisions about candidates part of what plays in there is like the residues of who you want to lead your like voyage to candy land to fight off the scary pirates or like who's your favorite heletubby or something and it's absurd but it's very biological and it's very implicit just rumbling underneath the surface in us that is bizarre but I mean it does make sense when you really think about it it doesn't really explain what happened in this last election but it is fascinating studying nonetheless and it does make perfect sense we often make decisions about things emotionally long before we actually consider them intellectually I mean this is something that within the skeptic movement which I find myself being being a part of lately we talk about a lot is trying to become more aware of our implicit biases trying to become more aware of all of the psychological phenomena that can be errors in our thinking and apply logic to our decision making and that is an uphill battle that nobody can you know sufficiently do all the time so this conversation about decision making about the timing of decision making which I think is so brilliantly described in your book even by the the way that you lay out the chapters it's kind of like the moment of the decision the moments before the decision the lifetime leading up to the moment of the decision the evolutionary history leading up to the moment of the decision I mean it's so brilliant how all of these things contribute but when it comes down to it it's somehow at least in the press but I think it's it's maybe a natural thing comes down to this conversation about free will and that is persnickety that conversation about free will and I'm sure you're probably tired of talking about free will at this point but I would love to hear kind of the cliff snouts version of your your take on this you know wildly complicated topic well weirdly enough by now after like obsessing over all of this stuff or like most of my lifetime it doesn't seem the complicated stuff anymore which is it seems utterly apparent to me that there is no free will everything that we do is the end product of sort of the biological antecedents has much been complicated as recognizing that not only are the relevant antecedents once it came a second before or a minute before or a cultural histories worth before that seems utterly straightforward by now and on a certain level that like floats between what I feel like is a truism by now and a sound bite is free will is just what we call the biological that hasn't been discovered yet what's incredibly complicated though is actually imagining how we're supposed to function as if there's no free will and it's really hard and even me with my like sitting there oh you want me to cite thousands of studies showing there's no free will and then somebody compliments me on something and I'm like all pleased and say thank you instead of saying no no it's an outcome of my neurons and my hormones and my epigenetics and like it's mighty hard to think that way and in lots of ways if it's the hello it is Ryan and we could all use an extra bright spot in our day couldn't we just to make up for things like sitting in traffic doing the dishes counting your

it's hugely difficult challenge just how we're supposed to think about the world if there's no free will at the very least we should do the hard work of thinking towards that when we think we're understanding behaviors that we're judging harshly do you think that the term free will is a problematic one I sometimes wonder when I hear philosophical and intellectual conversations about free will how easy it can be mistaken in the minds of certain individuals as an argument against sort of religious free will well that one I mean it depends on what's right you are arranged from if you're like a good old Puritan and everything is predetermined free will as a silly notion or if free will is something we were given by some deity and thus we got to run with it or in the paradox that I find really amusing if free will is such a wonderful gift that was given to us by a deity that we have absolutely no choice but to worship the individual which seems a little bit of a logical problem there but in terms of like the dangers or the consequences of at least from my view thinking there's free will when there isn't it's pretty straightforward this erroneous sense that we have agency over all of our behaviors we're willing to kill people over that sort of their erroneous thought I mean just ask somebody from the state of Texas we put people to death over notions that are biologically unsupportable by modern science about our responsibility for our actions damage the right part of somebody's brain and they can tell you the difference between right or wrong and unless at the critical juncture they cannot control their behavior and it's not an issue of them having a rotten soul or a lack of like self-discipline it's a radiological phenomenon that they cannot regulate their behavior at that point and attributing notions quaint archaic neanderthalish notions like frankly free will in that case are the grounds that we put people to death for lock them away forever for you know it's true but it's it's so much more complicated than just as you said getting at the root or starting to live as as if we understand this phenomenon and making decisions based on our understanding of this phenomenon the the complication comes in when somebody does commit a horrific crime and ultimately didn't have the ability to make a determination about whether or not that was the right thing to do the appropriate thing to do the moral thing to do or simply couldn't physically control their reactionary actions you know out of desperation or for whatever reason it happened what do you do about that societally you know well i have an acclue other than like learn about the science but just as one is about to say oh great a lot of help that is nonetheless something i take comfort from is we have been able to do precisely that some realms we do that effortlessly now and still have a society that has semblance of being just and functional here's an exam 500 years ago if you had an epileptic seizure the most wise the most reflective the most insightful the most bleeding heart liberal of that time would have had an explanation for what it was about which is you were demonically possessed and there was a therapeutic intervention recommended which would be to burn you at the stake because who needs demonically possessed people around here they're dangerous and somewhere in the last couple centuries we've learned oh it's not demonic possession it's a neurological disorder it's not that this person was like sleeping with Satan they've got screwed up potassium channels in one part of their brain and we're able to recognize if somebody has a seizure and in the process they like knock a glass off the table and shatter it oh no this was not criminal intent to damage like home and property not it's a neurological disease it's not their fault it's not them it's their disease and not only have we learned how to like completely banish the work it's like blame or forgiveness but we even know how to constrain it if somebody has treatment resistant epilepsy it's not a good idea that they drive a car they typically can't but no one would say that then being unable to drive a car until the epilepsy's under control constitute a case of justice is being meted out properly you don't get like crowds of coity or sia who peasants like gathering around and cheering as they burn the epileptic strivers licenses no that's a realm of which we've learned that's a biologically constrained behavior here's what you do in order to keep people safe from it but like words like soul or Satan or nonsense like that never come into it and okay so it's merely taking us about 500 years to get to that point so in some ways that's a model system for we can we can have a society in which we can at least deal with some things as fully biologically based and to act accordingly and to act without judgment and things haven't fallen into anarchy it's true we've we have really gotten away from you know that kind of terminology especially in the courtroom possession devil demon spirits soul this kind of arcane and draconian way of looking at these things and of course having punishments at match but we do still often talk about things like good and evil it's interesting how that hasn't really left the legal vernacular I mean I understand a conversation about morality and ethics but good and evil at least to me are problematic yet they're pervasive absolutely and those are words that are or should be irrelevant to how we view human behavior if we are using sort of 21st century knowledge as to what the things are that drive our behavior and just as like one throws up their hands in the air at that point and say give me a break you're going to tell me sadam Hussein or Hitler or who those two we can't use words like those again it's so hard for us to conceive of this but somebody 500 years ago with no less capacity to think critically and reflectively would have used a word like that for people we now recognize as having a neurological disease it's absurd now to say that except that in certain parts of the less developed world there still is that view but at least in the West it's absurd to say that it's their biology that's wrong the word evil that's ridiculous and all that's happening is the vast majority of the science that sort of informs us about human behavior now we need nothing about 50 years ago or 10 years ago or two years ago all this new stuff is pouring in all that's going to happen is we're going to learn more and more examples where oh it's a biological constraint and it's absurd to use words like punishment or retribution or evil or blame absolutely absolutely well Robert I know that I've taken up a lot of your time and it's it's been a really enlightening conversation to say the least I could probably talk to you for hours but I need to be able to let you go on to your busy schedule before we do that though I always close my episodes by asking my guests the same two questions and I'd be fascinated to hear your responses to those two questions you ready to dive in sure all right here they're kind of big picture but I think you talk you think about these things in your everyday life a lot all right so when you're thinking about the future I want you to think in whatever context is relevant to you right now it could be your own future the future of your family your work the human species the universe um two sides of the same coin the first one is what is the thing that keeps you up the most at night concerns you the most worries you the most preoccupies your mind but on the flip side of that what are you the most kind of hopeful and excited and optimistic about okay optimistic I might just will start with that one because it's hard for me to ever be optimistic like so I'll just sort of get that one out of the way um but one is forced to admit it's a much more compassionate world now than this planet was like 200 years ago at the time slavery spousal abused child laborer abusive animals were just then worldwide and now amid absolutely the reality that all of those march on they're nonetheless much more constrained people recognize kinship and people they never used to them the past people adopt someone from the other side of the planet and raise them as a love to member their family were you know in the last century we invented criminal courts we invented bands on behavior we invented bands on weapons international criminal courts the notion of crimes against humanity we invented organizations that will deliver relief to disaster victims on the other side of globe when we give money for where it's become a much more compassionate world and there's lots of reasons to believe that will continue and much of that has to do with our increased ability I think to take somebody else's perspective and see them as an individual and where I'm pessimistic about this is the fact that nonetheless it is so much of an uphill battle so much of the time to be able to do that and so many of the most intuitions and the most powerful demagogues who are rang us are
