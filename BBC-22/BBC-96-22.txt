Oh! Welcome to F-Said 4 of the curious case of rather than fri- today as Adam just beautifully demonstrated is the case of the mad bad moon Is that what we're calling it? I hadn't noticed that yeah Can't it be the case of the bad moon rising? The bad moon rising I hadn't considered the title what I don't get it. It's a song. Oh Your music again Shall we say what this is actually about it's not just about moon based music much to my annoyance This episode instead is about why people behave differently during full moons Indeed if they do indeed if they do but it was an opportunity for us to make lots of werewolf jokes and reference and mooning jokes We didn't make any mooning jokes. No, we've missed an opportunity. Why has this come to us so late? No, don't start mooning. No, don't say that because people will write him now Oh come on this is how rumours start We've got a foot. We've got a living in the photographer There is a professional photographer in the booth. I'm calling a jar This is going to be leaked. I'm going to be on have I got news for you or in court? Okay, where's we go back to the beginning? On with the show oh The moon is coming through the mist Hang on and we are a bit late for Halloween here, but this is today's question It's come all the way from El Paso in Texas Jeff Boone writes a teacher I work with swears that around the time of each full moon the kids are rowdy in classroom There's more vandalism in the community and more marital disharmony in her neighborhood Is there any biological reason why the moon's phases could really affect human moods and behavior? Lunatics. Oh, steady on. No, that's the way the word comes from Luna Roman goddess of the moon Oh, I see right. Well the moon has had an incredible influence on the earth and our culture from Defining the months in our calendar to generating the tides The Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder thought that we were susceptible to the moon's power to He said that it produced a heavy nocturnal dew that moistened the brain making us more susceptible to lunar changes And in literature the moon has influenced countless authors for example Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein in 1816 Under the glare of a gibber smooth by Lake Geneva and in Shakespeare when a fellow murders Desdemona he blames his action on a moment of lunacy It is the very error of the moon She comes more nearer earth than she was won't and makes men mad Yes, I'm not sure you'd get away with that these days on a court. No, possibly not But it is not just in fiction There are some shocking real life stories in history too at the Bedlam hospital in London in the 18th century Patients were chained and flogged at certain phases of the moon to prevent violence Okay, I'm hearing a lot of fiction and anecdotal evidence here Has there been any real research into a link between the phases of the moon and actual human behaviour Well, yes, there has my looping friend here with some actual science is Eric Trudler He's a neuroscientist at the University of Washington Many people believe that the phase of the moon especially the full moon causes more Crime more traffic accidents more visits to the emergency room more murders more suicides in general just more Violent abnormal behavior first. Let's take crime and homicide in particular Is there any evidence that murder rates peak during the full moon? So there was one study in Florida that there was actually an increase in the number of murders Not only during the full moon But what thing that's usually not mentioned is that they also found an increase around the new moon So it was not just a full moon effect for this one study However, when they tried to repeat this study elsewhere they couldn't find a link When the same investigators looked at another part of the country they found no relationship at all And other people have tried to replicate those studies. It's relatively easy You just look at the police blottered for incidents of a particular crime like murder And you go to the Almanac to look at the phase of the moon and the majority of studies have found that there is no Significant relationship between phase of the moon and murder rate All right, but that's just murder though, isn't it? So what about other criminal behavior? Well, when you look at violent crime in general Police record show no correlation at all between 350,000 calls and lunar phase Okay, so that is pretty good evidence But why then do we find some studies that do supposedly find a link and how do we tell the difference between the ones that are credible and The ones that are not well you have to remember there's a lot of randomness going on here And the thing about random statistical fluctuations is that they can make it look like there's a link just by chance When there isn't especially in very small studies what you have to do is take a step back and look at the bigger picture Rather than just focusing on the cases where a connection was found all right math That's crime out then but what about health because there's been loads of health issues that have been linked to the lunar cycle things like anxiety and depression and even suicide attempts Ambulance trips and car crashes here's health psychologist and broadcaster Claudia Hammond you might find individual studies Which often very small that might find that there is a relationship But when you look across studies the full moon is unrelated to say the number of psychiatric admissions the number of car accidents All the number of attempted suicide so we can go down the list of all possible Psychiatric mental health issues behavioral issues and and your content saying there's no correlation between their frequency and the state of the moon I'm content in saying that nobody has been able to demonstrate an effective link so far That doesn't mean somebody won't manage it in the future But looking at the evidence the evidence isn't there at the moment for saying that's true. What about we're wolf attacks That's got to be a strong correlation there. There are there's the only time they happen The creature emerged in the bloodiest fangs flashing in the moonlight as it emitted blood Okay, enough of that there is one intriguing faith for their atom that always gets quoted in these arguments And it showed a positive link between lunar phase and animal bite Yes, where was no not where was dogs there's one study that showed that the number of dog bites did show a Relationship in that there's a higher risk for being bitten by a dog during the full moon But this was a relatively small study and when the weekends were controlled for in other words when they looked to see when the full moon Landed on a weekend when that variable was taken out of the equation No significant difference was found so it's just that you're more likely to get bitten on a weekend Then it's got nothing to do with the full moon right right on on the weekends People take their dogs out for a walk So there are more dogs outside and more people are outside So there'd be more animals around people and so it's more likely that someone might encounter a dog And so it's more likely that they might be bitten Similarly if a study doesn't take into account Holidays where people might be walking their dogs and things like that then that can also influence the Result of that study also not even dogs not even dogs sadly And I think it's a really good example of why you can't get to excited about finding a correlation between two things like Full moons and animal bites because it doesn't imply that one is causing the other right But one thing is definitely clear all of this evidence all this lack of evidence It hasn't stopped people from believing in this lunacy I Ask Claudia why people still believe people hang on to these types of beliefs With tenacious grips What how do they react to people like you as a psychologist when you tell them You know what it's just a myth People don't like it when I say that things are myths and so I I write a monthly column for BBC future on different myths And people actually love arguing and they don't believe it even when I present all the evidence So we do hold onto these things and we don't really want to change our minds about them And you know there are studies demonstrating how hard it is to change people's minds about things But I should carry on presenting the evidence quite the good part Do you think it is that embedded in our culture that idea that the moon has has some effects On us that that confirmation bias people just really really Kling onto it as a cultural idea. I think it's a really strong cultural idea I think that many people believe it and many people want to believe it And so with confirmation bias you look for information and you notice information and pay attention to information That confirms the thing you were thinking we all do it all the time So if somebody thinks that migration is a problem then they notice stories about migration and they notice more migrants around if people don't think migration is a problem Then they don't notice it my wife's sister is a police officer And we've had her over to dinner and one time the conversation turned to the full moon and she would swear that During a full moon that she would go to more domestic violence cases that she would pull more people out of the ditch because of a Motive vehicle accident and I asked her you know Do those things happen at other times of the month when it's not a full moon and she said well Yes, they do happen at other times, but I just don't notice it And the people that hold the strongest beliefs that the moon affects behavior are people in very stressful Occupations people who are in law enforcement Medical personnel for example Emergency room doctors and nurses these are highly educated people and it's my idea that perhaps these people hold the strongest beliefs because they see bad things happen And oftentimes bad things happen for no apparent reason and by assigning blame to something like the moon Perhaps it will help them cope better with some of these terrible things that they see in their jobs Yeah, it's not surprising really. I we are incredibly good at looking for patterns around us and trying to find a reason for why things happen Just part of being human Yeah, it is but how about this because the moon definitely did change behavior in the past There was for example the lunar society and it was in 18th century Birmingham where industrialists and intellectuals and scientists And they met by the full moon to talk about ideas and it was people like Erasmus Darwin and Joseph Priestley and James what and Josiah Wedgherard and they called themselves lunatics it's not exactly a group known for their mental instability, are they? No, they are not but they met at the full moon so they could walk home with a decent light after a couple of Beers seems sensible Yes, and more like might have also been the reason why there were perhaps more crime and poaching at full moons in the past Basically, it makes it much easier to see what you do. Okay fine, but back to the 21st century then does Eric think that we can finally bring This lunacy to an end. I think we can we can say that the moon does not cause any of these abnormal behaviors But I want to remind you that the moon does affect behavior We write poems we create artwork we write music all about the moon. It's embedded in our culture It's a romantic so it does affect our behavior, but it doesn't cause people to act out of the ordinary But it certainly holds a place within our lives So Dr. Rutherford when it comes to the full moon causing crime, vandalism and general lunacy Can we say case salt? Yes, Dr. Fry we can there are some isolated studies that appear to have found a link from dog bites to But when you look at the big picture across health and crime that isn't any solid evidence except in Wales So that was the curious case of the bad moon rising No, it wasn't it's called the bad mad moon No mad bad moon I'm going for bad moon rising. Okay. We'll see what ends up on the iTunes title I think it's called bad moon rising You're just discussing extremely obscure titles to songs that no one born post 1980 have heard about Blue moon there's been lots of versions of blue moon. I've heard of blue moon But this has got nothing to do with the color blue but we could do the uh we could do that There's the Elvis version and then there's the Marcel's version Which has that you know that that's the one with the Wababa Baba Baba We've already done we've already done it. I haven't finished it but I'll be out You ruined it But we could have had we could have had the killing moon by anyway Thanks a lot to our producer Michelle Constant patience Uh throughout this great moon right to come weight Thanks to Moon dance by Van Morrison our listeners who send in excellent questions Don't forget to send us in more the whole of the moon by the water boys at bbc.co.uk I don't moon dance have an eye don't forget you can read more about the series The oh where wolves of London by Warren's even does actually reference the moon but it's about where wolves There are lots of songs but that's the end goodbye
