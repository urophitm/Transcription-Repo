This week I had the opportunity to chat with Dr. Oliver Hamson. He's an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information where he directs the community research on identity and technology or crit lab. He's also affiliate faculty with the Digital Studies Institute and a senior fellow at the Center for Applied Transgender Studies or Cats. He has a new book out called Trans Technologies. So without any further ado, here he is, Dr. Oliver L. Hayson. Well, Oliver, thank you so much for joining me today. Thank you for having me. It's really great to get to talk with you today. I am excited to talk about your new book, Trans Technologies, and I have to ask first, right at the top. Are there, like, is this the only book about this? Is that, are you the one or is this an area that we're starting to see more writing, kind of focusing in? I think there's only one book that I know of that is really focused in this area and that would be the book by Avery Dame Griff that came out. And it's really about histories of trans technology and trans people on the internet. And so my book is really taking the perspective of looking at right now and even looking at the future. And I think it could be the first book that's explicitly about trans technologies in this moment. I love that. And so before we even get into your background or what you do for a living, like, let's just write at the top, what is a trans technology? I think a lot of people, maybe they haven't put those two terms together, like, do transgender individuals utilize different types of technology? Like, what does that look like? Yeah, that's a great question. And that was actually one of the questions that motivated me to do all these interviews with creators of technology that was made for trans people's unique needs. So that's kind of one of the definitions that I'm thinking of. That's what I call this more practical definition. So it's just technology that is made to address some of these unique needs and challenges that trans people in communities have. So that would be things like, you know, an app that can track your hormones. So you make sure to take your shots at the right time or a virtual reality system that allows you to explore gender. So things like that. And then there is also a more theoretical definition that I have come up with through all these conversations I've had with creators of technology. And that is about more of the trans aspect of technology. So what I mean by that is transness is all about change and transition. And I think that that can also be applied to technology. So it's really thinking about technology in new ways or thinking about how we can create new worlds through technology. Oh, I love that. So sort of recontextualizing what we thought we knew or even, I don't know, when I think about like, I hate putting it on the continuum. But when I think about trans versus, I hate saying versus, but trans and we'll say and trans and cis identities, this idea of self and other and what has been normative and what has been other and how do we recontextualize to be more inclusive or to change our perspective so that this in group out group status is not a so pernicious, but be so static. Yeah, we probably don't do that enough with technology. Exactly. And I think that's a really nice way to think about it because we have all these mainstream technologies that are either explicitly or just happened to be designed for what they're considering an average user. And you know, none of us are really average. We all have unique aspects and unique needs and challenges. And because trans people tend to have these unique challenges that are not often met by mainstream technologies, that's what pushes people to create their own technologies. And that's what I'm really fascinated by is people who are, you know, let's say using a mainstream social media platform and realizing that they're facing a lot of hate speech, a lot of harassment, things like that. And there aren't really great tools to combat that. Well, they could stay on that platform and hope it's going to get better or they could find a community of other trans people who face similar things or have similar ways of thinking about how content moderation should work and then create their own community elsewhere. Yeah. Or even in the same place sometimes, right? But in an insulated way or using the right search terms or tags or I guess there's no right way to sort of adapt to technology and to make it work for you. Yeah, exactly. So I'm curious about your sort of relationship to your content, to your research, you know, both personally and professionally because it's sort of I'm making a little chi square in my head with you. So it's like you've got your personal life, you've got your professional life and then you've got these two really interesting topics and they are crossing over in an important way and that is technology and also transgender individuals, transgender community. So, you know, what is that relationship for you? What is your personal? What's your professional and what is the relationship between sort of those two worlds? Yeah, I mean, I think I first got into this research area just because of my own experience with gender transition and at the time I was using social media law and really just fascinated by the ways that people were using social media when they were transitioning and thinking about how to disclose what audiences to disclose. Like that all becomes so much more complicated on social media and so I was researching specifically at trans experiences on social media for a long time and then I started to realize that there are so many trans technologies beyond just social media and the world is just so much bigger than that. There's so many things that I would have never thought of myself that people are creating and using and so I just got fascinated by that and I think it helps studying this from an in-group perspective. I mean because I can take an ethnographic approach and instead of just looking at an app or any kind of technological system, I can actually try and use it and see what I think about it and so that's been I think really helpful to share an identity with the people that I am studying but at the same time I'm very different from a lot of the people that that I talk to you with my research. Part of it is because I started transitioning in around 2010 which is kind of a long time ago. Now I'm also a lot older, I'm a lot more financially privileged privileged in a lot of ways and so it's an interesting case to study a group that you're a part of in one way but then each person has so many unique identities that I am actually quite different from a lot of the people that I study so I try to keep all of that in mind and really think about that positionality as I'm doing this research. I think that's so fundamentally important. It might be one of the most important things that we say in this hour is this idea that you know we operate very often culturally and you know this is the first of many times I'm going to roll my eyes when I say this but like what I mean there's not a better time to be kind of bringing this out into the light but we operate culturally very often along these in group versus out group distinctions along these lines of what is normative and what is other and yet they're constructs because even though we can say well because of this specific demographic feature you know trans individuals are in this group over here we are intersectional and there is more difference within a group very often than there is between groups. Right exactly and I mean that kind of leads really well into one of the main arguments in the book which is exactly about intersectionality because one thing I start to realize as I was doing this research is that a lot of these people who are creating trans technologies tend to be quite privileged in terms of things like race and education and class and that really matters because if we the people that are creating technology for the community are in some ways different from the majority of the community then they're not going to necessarily be creating the things that will help address the communities needs and challenges the most and so that's what I found is that you know people are often just creating based on their own experiences and I think that's totally normal I mean all technology tends to be like that if you look at startups and people who are creating technology they're thinking about needs that they come across in their life but when the group of people who has the resources and the skills and the time to create technology are really just drawing from their own experiences and the experiences of people that they know personally maybe then that's not going to necessarily be as impactful as it could be. Oh completely I remember having gosh now it's been so long I couldn't even point to the episode but I could go back into my archives and talking to somebody about something very similar within the community of individuals with disabilities and developing sort of adaptive technologies based on actual need as opposed to based on like I don't know invented need and that you know if if I'm a person who let's say has undergone an amputation and I am using a prosthesis or I am in a very let's say just from a financial position I've undergone an amputation and I'm rich versus somebody who's undergone the exact same amputation but they're living in poverty yeah their struggles are going to be different and the types of technologies they use are going to be different. Yeah exactly and so what I think is really that we just need to start by thinking about what are the needs of what are the biggest challenges rather than than starting from what are my personal challenges and how can I fix those and I think that's not necessarily intuitive for people it's also more difficult you know because you have to find ways to connect with the broader community and involve them in ideation and in design and all of this and that can be challenging for people so you know one of the things that I am arguing is that we need more systems for this we need ways to connect people who have these skills to create technology with other people who might have really good ideas or you know really understand what the community needs are but might not have those skills or might not have time to even think about that. Oh for sure you know I I'd love to take a second to talk a little bit about how you approach these things sort of in a scholastic way and an academic way I'm always fascinated and I guess it makes sense because you know you're on the show right now and we're talking about things that are very similar to this but this idea of constructs and this idea of the human sort of urge or drive to categorize and how wiggly that often is and I think university departments fall into that so perfectly so I'm super curious you know you study human computer interaction and social computing and of course you focus on transgender identities and experiences online like what the hell department is that and also what did you study throughout your academic career to be able to have that multi-disciplinary training and expertise. Yeah such a good question so I'm in the School of Information and we are a field that a lot of people don't really know about but it's a very interdisciplinary field so there are people in my school that are from all different backgrounds and we do all different types of methods but the thing that binds us together is really caring about this intersection of people and technology and society and so my own background my PhD is in information and computer science from Department of Informatics so it's sort of in information but not exactly because it's a different word but it kind of means the same thing so a lot of people just really don't understand what this field even does but you know I tend to say that I'm a human computer interaction and social computing researcher because that's the type of places where I publish and that's where I make most of my contributions but at the same time I am also in this world of trans studies which is also really interdisciplinary and has people from you know humanities fields and social science fields and even health fields and we were we had a conference back in September the second International Trans Studies conference and it's just fascinating because you have people from all of these different fields and there's a growing contingent of people like me that are coming from computing type of disciplines but I'm really trying to bring together trans studies with human computer interaction and what into what I'm calling trans technology studies and I'm trying to make that a thing I feel like it's not quite a thing yet you're gonna make that happen I love it and you know there's a small group of us and there's just so much exciting new research happening in this space and I think there's a lot of really interesting contributions that can only happen at this intersection so I'm actually really excited about it oh I love that and I asked this fully narcissistically but as a psychologist like are there a lot of people in this kind of space that are coming from more social science kind of psychology philosophy sociology backgrounds as well I think some yeah I don't I mean honestly there's just people from all different fields like when I admit PhD students for instance there's not any one background that I'm looking for and so sometimes people do come from psychology and but it would be just as likely that they would come from humanities or computer science and everyone kind of can find a home in our discipline I love it so let's let's talk a little bit maybe about that sort of I don't know what the distinction is the hard versus soft or the explicit versus implicit types of trans technologies that you describe in the book so you know the kind of more obvious technologies being the things that through your research you've grown to understand that trans folks use right or that trans folks need or that trans folks are working towards developing or have adapted in order to work for them what are some of the things that you've kind of learned yeah so some of the technologies are really standard things that you would probably think of like a resource to find healthcare providers who trans affirming or who can do specific types of procedures in your area but then there's all of these really interesting and kind of strange technologies I can give an example because I think examples are a nice way to really understand what I'm talking about here when I say trans technology in a theoretical sense so there was this team creating facial prosthetics that could if you put this on your face you could basically have two different Apple IDs so you know when you unlock an iPhone for instance it looks at your face and it logs you in and if you wanted to have two different identities on your iPhone that would be really hard because you only have one face and so this team was creating these facial prosthetics that you could basically put on so that you could have multiple identities on your iPhone but then there's further implications for that in terms of let's say you're trying to avoid surveillance in public spaces that's another way that you could do that's another use for that technology would be to obfuscate those type of surveillance technologies so I thought that was really interesting because it's not it's not specifically like we are creating this for trans people but the fact that trans people often have periods of their life when they have multiple identities when they're trying to transition from one identity to another and you know their face might be changing in certain ways that are difficult for technological systems to understand and so this is a way of thinking about technology I think in a new way that's inspired by trans technology but is not as just obvious as a hormone tracker or a resource site or something like that yeah and I think it also does kind of again go back to speaking to the intersectionality of it all that you know I think about for example I don't know the most obvious example is just because I was recently watching a movie where the actors were British and they were very mumbly and I was like thank goodness for closed captioning I know I have to have captioning I have to I'm a millennial I can't help it and that's the thing right like I'm not deaf and I'm not hard of hearing but they help me it's a technology that is there as an adaptive technology that helps a lot more than maybe the initial group that it was developed for and that's that's just really really helpful and I can imagine that that's the case over and over again as you learn about these new these new kind of technological spaces yeah I mean absolutely because if you think about the ways that trans people use technology and face all these barriers and mainstream technologies those are barriers that are going to be in place for other people as well for various reasons you know maybe there are other people who are going through life transitions that involve things like name changes or your network changes the whole lot and both technologies are not really built for people's lives to change or people's identities to change a lot over time and I think that that's a reason why it's so important to study trans people in one sense so that we can help improve trans people's lives but just in general technology really needs to change to be able to adapt to people who are changing because that's just such an important part of life nobody is going to stay the same over time oh absolutely and I think it also helps support individuals at I guess formative times in their lives like when we think about what it means to try on different identities to try and understand who we are and how we relate to the world this is something that is deeply explored in adolescence right and who are some of the biggest consumers of technology are adolescent users people for whom the identity development is still deeply in flux and you know we're learning how we want to be who we want to be what feels the most authentic to us we're trying on different friend groups different types of music different yeah just different identities and ultimately maybe something will be a little bit more consistent or like you said maybe not but that's a group that I think is also very sensitive and very shall I say vulnerable within the technological space yeah absolutely and I think you see new emerging technologies really trying to fill that space of allowing people more identity exploration so if you think about face filters for instance those are I think a really unique way for people but I think a lot of young people especially to explore who they are who they want to be and it's so easy it's just within your phone and that's actually something that we've been really interested in in my research team thinking about face filters and the ways that it can be more centered on trans experiences because right now a lot of trans people use these gender swap face filters but they're really mostly designed for cisgender people who are just thinking like oh it would be funny to see what I might look like as a different gender but there are so many opportunities there to really help people explore and try to understand what their gender might be and it doesn't have to always just be this is exactly what I want to look like it can also be more fantastical or more exploratory like you know maybe you just want to see what a butterfly looks like in your hair something like that you know totally stuff like that too yeah and I think that that is that part of the identity development and I'm curious you're take on this because you've obviously looked into this in a deeply academic way a personal way my my exposure and experience with trans communities is both clinical right from from a clinical psychology perspective and also just human right because I have trans friends and I'm thinking of one friend in particular who told me that part of their discovery and part of the safety that came about as they started to transition early on came for them at least from being involved in this sort of like pseudo furry community and they were saying that part of it was that you could be a character you could be almost like an avatar you could be a sort of creature that was somewhat genderless or gender non-conforming and explore what it felt like to be a gender for a while to really discover aspects of yourself that were too constrained when you had to kind of perform masculinity all the time this was a trans woman and so I found it really interesting that through that kind of community and through maybe using like a more kind of creature like fun avatar that she ultimately was able to kind of find who she is yeah that's that's fascinating and I really like I mean furries are not a technology I mean maybe depending on your definition or your definition yeah reminds me of this trans technology that I included in the book through the wardrobe so it's basically augmented reality experience where you are in a bedroom but the augmented reality shows you elements that you wouldn't be able to see about different items of clothing or makeup or things like that and you can try things on and it was just really unique and I think one of the things that was really cool about it is that it wasn't just for trans people it's for anybody who just wants to have that experience of exploration and so I think we need more space for everybody to just be able to play with identity and explore in that way where it's very low stakes it's kind of fun and it's just a way to kind of just see what it might be like and maybe you try on something and it's not right for you but that's the point of the experiences to see what things might be like and I really love the potential of emerging technologies things like virtual reality augmented reality for instance I think are important ways to do that because you can create a whole new avatar for yourself and you can interact with other people as that avatar in a way that it's really hard to do that in the physical world you know like and not just hard it's risky like that yeah that's the thing too this is so safe because you can do it almost like in an exposure therapy kind of a way first I want to just see myself in the mirror I want to see how I feel in this skin I want to see my comfort level now maybe I will start to engage with other people who feel safe to me online and you know maybe I don't reveal my identity quite yet and then eventually you know start because yes part of transitioning is really understanding that the world will treat you a certain way and that is a very scary and unsafe especially along I mean I don't even have to say this out loud but especially when there are people in positions of power who sort of reinforce and codify or are attempting to codify a legislation and rhetoric that is bigoted and harmful right the world is being told now it's okay to treat you know a person a certain way purely because of their identity of course that's dangerous of course it's scary if if technology can help somebody where where the identity safely for a while and determine how they feel and kind of work at their own pace what a gift yeah absolutely and yeah I think yeah especially in this political climate as you said it's so risky especially for Transfeminine people I think to be in the physical world just as themselves a lot of times and I think that as we were talking about earlier how a lot of the trans communities needs are not always met with the trans technologies that exist I think safety is such an important area that we need to do more and because there are just not very many safety technologies that can help people when they find themselves in unsafe situations one of my PhD students Denny Starks is actually working on creating a safety technology specifically for trans people of color and so I'm really excited to see where we go with that but that's one area that I think there needs to be so much more work and and what's hard sometimes from an academic perspective is that sometimes the things that are most needed by communities are not always the things that are most intellectually exciting in terms of you know can I make an intellectual contribution in a research paper about this it's a little harder than something else that might not be as valuable to the community so that's I think been attention in some of our work I can only imagine that very often the things that are the most needed the the solutions to some of the most intractable problems are not a question of ingenuity but a question of political will or kindness you know just like yeah like the zeitgeist changing and that can be really really tough right I wish we could just invent a new thing and solve a deep social justice problem but very often it's not because we're lacking the technology it's because we're lacking the political will yeah or the resources or you know and and I don't want to make it sound like I think technology solves every problem that's clearly not the case and there's so many systemic issues that we really just need society to change like we we need people to to be less racist we need people to be less transphobic and technology is not going to solve that problem and so what I the way I think about it is not as a solution but more of as something that can help and since myself and my students we are in a position where we can help and so we are really trying to to think about you know the book was was trying to understand all of the things that are out there but we also have an arm of our research that is working with communities doing participatory design methods and then actually trying to build some of these technologies that we think can make an impact oh I love that you know it's interesting because I don't want to kind of gloss over something that you said that maybe we could dig into more maybe not this idea that yes like society does need to be less racist it needs to be more anti-racist right it needs to be more feminist it needs to be less white supremacist it needs to be you know less transphobic can technology aid in in those initiatives as well I think there are ways that it can and I think honestly this would probably draw a lot from psychology in terms of understanding what types of interventions would really help to enable people to see things differently and that's such a hard problem obviously you know in our political climate is so polarized and everyone wants the other side to see things differently and I think that there are plenty of studies in non-technological settings that can show you know ways to maybe slightly impact people's viewpoints but that seems like such a really hard problem to me if you are a plumbing technician your enemy is sitting still because when you're sitting you're not making much money if you have at least three years of experience as a service tech reach out to whites plumbing I keep them busy people trust whites plumbing and have since 1957 so if you're interested in a new place to work reach out to whites plumbing 8505763510 are you ready to be a part of something bigger become the first responder in the truest sense the CDA is looking for

are accepted on a continuous basis it really does and I wonder if and I don't again I might be stretching the definition of technology here but I often think of media as a form of technology and one of the simplest things and we're seeing I think bigger and bigger pushes and and and the outcomes kind of speak for themselves is we have to have representation in media when somebody has never met somebody who's trans or they don't know it then they it's easy to be afraid of or to hate the thing that you know you're just you don't know but the minute that you have people in your life we see this all the time with our politicians right they're like voting against gay marriage then they have a gay kid and all the sudden they're like you know some huge advocate and it's sad that sometimes it does take a personal experience but we we cannot know what we're never exposed to and it's very easy to hide from the world and to hold up and to stay in your safe little bubble but if you watch a mainstream TV show and there are trans characters that are out on the show if you watch a mainstream TV show and there are you know black women on the show in positions of power like the more that we see people who you know have various identities the more normative they become it's pretty simple yeah and it's it's actually a pretty complicated thing I think for me personally and I don't know if this goes along with what you want to focus on for the podcast but you know I am someone who in everyday settings people usually think I'm cisgender and it's different when you're just hearing my voice because as I mentioned I get misgendered a lot you know on the phone things like that but in everyday life I walk around and people typically assume that I'm a cisgender person and it's only been recently that I've been more public as a trans person and I think it's really important because I do see you know younger or you know people who need to see someone who I guess is I don't want to say like successful or but needs to see someone that is in a position like that I am in and so I've been doing that lately but for the longest time I wasn't able to because of just certain aspects of my life it was just too risky and it's so scary I think in this current environment to be publicly trans and yet I think it can be really helpful but I've just been on both sides of it so much yeah I mean I think you're speaking to something that's fundamentally important and like I hate to use this term because honestly it is it is a bit pejorative so I'm using an air quotes but this idea that like passing is a privilege right like even for me I'm you know I'm Latina I'm white right like I am white like I walk around with all the white privilege that any other white person gets and yes my mom's Puerto Rican and yes there's a lot of like Latina culture in my life but like I'm not judged for being Latina nobody knows it they might know it based on like my name or something but you know I don't I I'm white and I I get privileged from that and I've talked to some of my friends who say the very thing that they like they can when they quote pass or like when people misgender you assist gender that they that there's a privilege in that right that you don't have to deal with some of and there's a male privilege that comes with that as well right but you're right then once you do feel safe enough or once anybody feels safe enough to be able to and it's it's totally a personal choice because nobody can dictate that somebody else's safety then all of a sudden you you can serve as this example for individuals but you can't do it if you're unsafe to do so like that's that's very dangerous it's just it's wild to me because I made this decision that when the book comes out I'm going to be more public about this which I think it totally makes sense because you can't really write a book like this as you know a person like I couldn't not reveal my identity and so I didn't know what the political climate was going to be yeah how could you nobody thought this one you know like I wrote the book a couple years ago it's it takes a long time and so now I'm like in this position of being more publicist trans in the worst political time to do that but you know I made the decision and I think it's important and that's what I'm going to do but yeah I think what you mentioned is really important in that in so many aspects of my life I am the default identity like I am a white male and in so many aspects of my life I'm just seeing that way you know and but then in reality I am also part of this extremely stigmatized marginalized group especially in the current moment and so it's a very strange place to be in terms of identity I think a lot of people could learn a lot from that perspective as well that strange place that you find yourself in as hard as it is it's probably really really rich some important insights and some important knowledge that you know many of many of your friends and readers and and allies would would love to learn and it's an honor to be able to learn that from somebody who has like you said been on kind of in both worlds had a foot in both areas and can speak from from both I shouldn't even say both because it's not binary from multiple perspectives yeah exactly and I recognize it's not the case for many trans people they don't necessarily have a choice they go out every day knowing they're going to experience serious transphobia and I have the choice to kind of hide behind my whiteness my you know cis passing privilege what an interesting gosh I say that again in air quotes what a horrible and and just insane time to just be who you are against a backdrop of an administration saying you don't exist like not just you shouldn't be able to do x or oh you can't play in this sport or you know whatever these like stupid executive orders are but like really you're not real like it's it's such a bizarre claim to me yeah it's it makes no sense like how can you how can you tell people they don't exist you know that's right when I heard this executive order like yes it's going to have terrible implications in so many domains but nobody can actually tell an entire group of people who they are and what their gender is and that's a tiny part that I take comfort in absolutely like you can you can be stamped with some sort of official government you know I don't know a star on your shirt like they can they can say this is who you are and this is what we say but it doesn't that does not change your identity it just doesn't yes and you know I hope that there is a strong enough and brave enough community of both academic professionals who are in positions of power as well as political obviously people in positions of political power as well as everyday folks on the street who if we come out in numbers and we continue to stand up for the things that matter to us I mean there are whole fields as you know you know you're working in a university setting you are you have a job you are supported by your department I hope yes my entire field you know I we got a letter from our I guess it's like our advocacy group the American Psychological Association that was kind of like well all of this stuff they're telling us to do flies in the face of our very profession and the ethics code that we all abide by so we got to stand firm because otherwise who are we if we're not our ethics yeah exactly and I think the worst thing that we could do as academics right now is just preemptively change everything that we're doing like there's that's just straight up censorship you know they're saying okay don't use these words don't talk about these ideas I am absolutely not going to do any of that right and it's especially I guess obvious when the censorship is about your own identity yeah exactly yeah we have to do yourself yeah you can't you you just you can't disappear you know nor should you and and and nor should the work stop to identify and empower and develop and amplify these technologies that that help that help right like isn't that the goal is to help people and I think about it I think about trans technology in this moment as a form of resistance in general like not all of it is going to be explicitly resistance but there are lots of technologies that are not necessarily responding to this exact moment right now in 2025 because I think everyone is just stunned and trying to figure out how to survive but there's been so many things in the past few years that have come out like technology to try to connect to people who can provide resources with people who need help in various ways or technologies that are tracking all of the laws and proposed laws that are against trans people and then there's also things like games and are that are not explicitly political but that people are doing as a type of trans technology to keep themselves alive to you know find some joy and excitement in what is otherwise a really hostile world and I think all of these are acts of resistance and this is not going to stop. Yeah absolutely yeah people have to continue to be who they are and to revel in their identities to find joy in the world that's a massive act of resistance is to experience joy against a background of I guess intentional joylessness. Trans people right now are very angry but at the same time people are finding joy in some aspects of life because you have to you can't just go around only being angry but it's not like that anger disappears when you are doing something that brings you joy it's always all there at the same time and so that's something that I really get into in the book quite a bit is this ambivalence of two things that seem like the intention they can actually both be true at the same time and I think that's just really such an important tension in this current moment. Yeah there's that very famous quote right that during the darkest days of the AIDS crisis we buried our friends in the morning we prostested in the afternoon and we danced all night. I actually don't heard that. Yeah and the idea here is what are we do what are we fighting for if not to keep dancing? Yeah right we have to be able to find joy against the darkness and it's not easy this political climate is terrifying and I think it's important to be honest with ourselves about that but to also be honest with the fact that like we are sort of we and they even I'm doing it now but we are letting them win if we find ourselves mired in panic and fear all the time and we lose we lose you know sight of that of that very joy. Yes absolutely and I think that's the point of all of this political theater is to create this chaos and to you know make people so angry and frustrated but they don't know what to do but I know that we're going to get through it and it's going to be very hard but I can't wait to see what what we can do when we are not just trying to survive all the time. I so agree and I think that is such a good and important point to make and I guess I would add to that that now is the time everyone that if you are in that position of privilege if you do feel safe enough to do so now is the time to not stand in the middle to not kind of step back but to make your voice heard and to do what you know is right and to keep doing the important work right even even if we're told that we're not supposed to be doing it we won't get federal funding for it the important work needs to keep being done whether that's across different scientific you know fields obviously here on talk nerdy we're often talking to scientists and academics whether that is in the DEI space and as we've been talking with you this whole time Oliver whether it is work on trans technologies it's so incredibly important and I'm really grateful for you to help open everybody's eyes about kind of even what this topic is why it matters and and to have taken the time to write this book trans technologies thank you so much for being here and for sharing with us today yeah thank you so much this was such a great conversation and I'm really excited to be on the talk campus.
