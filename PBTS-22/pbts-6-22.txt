Every day discoveries are made that will change our understanding of the world around us. Dr. Marie McNally is here to bring you the brilliant minds who are making these discoveries so they can share their incredible stories and take you on an amazing journey. Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of People Behind the Science. I am thrilled to be here today with Dr. Henry or Roddy Rodiger. Roddy is a James S. McDonald Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis, as well as the Dean of Academic Planning in Arts and Sciences there. He received his PhD in Psychology from Yale University, and Roddy has served as a faculty member at Purdue University and Rice University, as well as a visiting faculty member at the University of Toronto, before he joined Washington University in St. Louis. Roddy has received many awards and has many distinctions, including the William James Fellow Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for Psychological Science in 2012, the Howard Crosby War and Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 2008, and the Arthur Holly Compton Faculty Achievement Award from Washington University in St. Louis in 2008. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science. Roddy was also previously elected to serve as the President of the Association for Psychological Science the Midwestern Psychological Association and the Experimental Division of the American Psychological Association, and Roddy is joining us today to tell us all about his journey through life and science. So, Roddy, today we really want to get to know you as both a scientist but also as a person, so can you take a few minutes to tell us what do you like to do when you're not doing science? Well, I used to be a squash player and I would play squash nearly every day and then many weekends I would play tournaments, but now I am older, my knees have kind of given out, and so squash is out of the picture now. However, I still enjoy watching sports, I enjoy reading, my wife and I enjoy traveling quite a bit, and so we've had, for example, a couple of wonderful trips to South Africa that were especially memorable. So I would say travel, reading, we have two dogs, so we do it on those and walk those whenever we can, so those were my roughly speaking my outside activity. Wonderful, what kind of dogs do you have, Roddy? We have two Welsh chariars, one nine and one two, and they are very lively little dogs and just keep us busy all the time. They have very friendly warm personalities and they're hypoallergenic, so I strongly recommend them. That's wonderful. I'm a dog lover myself. We have a little pug in our house who I think rules the house most of the time. All right. So we're going to dive into the world of science now that we've gotten to learn a little bit more about you and what you like to do outside of the lab, but can you tell us how do you describe what you do to someone who's not in science? I always say I'm a cognitive psychologist and I study learning and memory and I study many different facets of learning and memory. I will describe a few to you that are currently a back of interest, so you can think of remembering most people think of how do I improve my memory. That's one thing I'm very interested in. Just two weekends ago I was in California in San Diego where we had the first ever extreme memory tournament. This is a 16 of the best people in the world at memorizing information came to that event and I have a grant from a company, Dartmouth neuroscience, to study these people and we had the tournament at Dartmouth neuroscience and it was just fascinating because these people were extraordinarily good remembered and you might think well they must have photographic memories. As far as I can tell no one has a photographic memory actually. These people use strategies that they've developed based on common mnemonic techniques that have been known in one way or another since the time of the ancient Greeks, but recently there's been a resurgence of interest in this activity and they call themselves memory athletes. They are there. They compete in the world memory championships, the US memory championships, Germany has a lot of these people, the current world memory champions from Sweden. So these people from all over the world, we had one from Mongolia, three from the Philippines. It was just fascinating. So I'm interested in how to improve memory and so one of the things I'm looking at is what might these people teach us and I could go into great detail about that. But of course these people have taken hundreds and hundreds of hours to learn these techniques that they use and so we can't ask well for mere mortals like ourselves what can we do to improve our memory and I've also got several lines of research asking that question and in fact two colleagues and I just published a book called Make It Stick, The Science of Successful Learning that just came out about a month ago and seems to be doing very well the early returns are and this is a book written for late people. The lead author is Peter Brown who is a professional writer and the other two authors are me and my colleague Mark McDonald, both of us are psychologists and academics who spare our lives studying memory and so we tried to supply the content, Peter woven into a beautifully written story for us. So we also worked hard on the book for about three and a half years but it's just come out so that kind of captures the upside of what I studied for memory. How to improve it, how to make it better, how can we fight the clients of memory in old age, those kinds of things. So that's one topic. Another topic that I research is illusions of memory or false memories. So just as we know we can have perceptual illusions, we know just looking at if you've ever taken a psychology course you see common visual illusions and they really do matter often what's called pilot errors due to the visual illusion of one sort or another or some other kind of illusion and the same way memory illusions occur we can remember things differently from the way they happen or in the most extreme case we can remember an event that didn't happen to us at all. Probably something related to it happened to us and so I've developed several paradigms to study false memories and I'm very interested in the whole situation of where memory plays tricks on us basically. A third line of research that I'm fascinated with currently and I'm just getting into it due to a colleague here in anthropology is something called collective memory. Collective memory is who we are as a people. How we internalize our past into our identity. So for example all Americans have an identity of being Americans, we learn our history, we have mythology, the city on the hill from the time of the Puritans where we're the beacon for freedom and democracy. You hear our leaders talk that way all the time. I used to live in Texas when I taught at Rice University and to me it was a fascinating place to live because Texas unlike many states has a very strong state identity. They really do remember the Alamo and they remember the Battle of San Jacinto and they remember Sam Houston and all these other things in a way that other states don't have such a strong identity. I grew up in Virginia so that state also has a fairly strong identity that so much happened there early on and during the Civil War. So the whole idea of collective memory is something that's emerged from the humanities and history in particular. It's kind of how people remember history. And when you look around the world people are fighting today about things that happened hundreds of years ago. So the rift between the Sunni and the Shi'ai Muslim world happened in I think it was in the 800s and yet they're still fighting about it and killing each other over it today. So how is it that these events from the past live and stay alive in us? I think today for example the Civil War is pretty much forgotten by most of America but if you go to certain places in the South it's as alive as if it ended 10 years ago and Charleston, South Carolina for example would be one place. The hometown I grew up in Danville, Virginia last capital of the Confederacy so they still talk about that there and so I'm interested in studying these things empirically and turning it in from case study type approach into a more empirical data collection type approach where we serve very large numbers of people to find up what they remember. Certainly that sounds like you've got fascinating research a lot of different types of projects going on the lab too which is exciting and yeah definitely it sounds like you're keeping quite busy I'm sure in the lab and then also outside of the lab with your family your dogs as well. Can you tell us is there a particular motivational quote or a saying that you like to keep in the back your mind as you go through your every day? Well this is a tough one I'll tell you there is one quote I have from William James sitting on my bulletin board and so when your professor working in many different things I'm also a gene you have all these projects hanging over you all the time like right now there are about eight papers I would like to be writing but I'm going to be grading papers all week so the quote is nothing as fatiguing as the eternal hanging of his uncompleted task and he probably thought of that when he was writing his great book principles of psychology which took him many years to write it was something like 10 years over due but he got to the publisher but it still remembered today so that's not exactly a great inspirational quote but I do try to get tasks completed I hate for them just to hang on forever so I think one hallmark with successful people that I've witnessed is the ability to get on and get something done not just to talk about it endlessly or to analyze data endlessly but to get the thing written up and out the door to get the book finished to get the project finished to get the grant proposal finished that to me is something that I've struggled with but I try to keep him the forefront of my mind every day I've got to get this done one of my former graduate students had hanging over his desk something he wrote it wasn't a quote it was what if you're written today email doesn't count that is fantastic I think that's an excellent quote and an excellent example from your graduate student as well just in terms of getting things done like you said and I think I'm one of those people that is exactly motivated by that concept I'm addicted to to do lists and just that feeling that gratifying feeling of being able to cross something off and say this is accomplished this is accomplished what do I have to do next so I definitely 100% agree with you that that's kind of a really big motivational force in my life and a lot of science his lives that I know as well so great example and can you tell us over the course of your career as a scientist kind of thinking about what things motivate you or what things inspire you are there particular people who really stick out in your mind as people who are role models for you yes as an undergraduate uh Washington League University in Virginia I had just some inspiring outstanding professors one was James Graham labor he was a sociologist and had come to Washington League from Yale and was deemed there fact he got rid of division one football at Washington League which I think was a great accomplishment he refocused in on academics and he was just an inspiring man he taught besides sociology and anthropology he taught a course in ancient history which is one I just love and so he was one of these Renaissance men who could seemingly do it all and he published books at the same time probably not at the same rate he did when he was at Yale but he was still an active scholar but a very active teacher David Elms was another mentor of mine as an undergraduate he had just gotten his PhD from the University of Virginia Washington League hired him and he helped set me on my path to research and to graduate school for which I'll be eternally grateful and then in graduate school I had two great mentors Robert Crowder was my PhD mentor he sadly died relatively early he was only 60 and the other person who was my mentor at Yale has been my mentor for my whole life and still is even though I'm 66 he's 86 his end old solving one of the great minds I think in our field of the 20th and early 21st century he's uh professor at the University of Toronto a Maritra Snell and also worked at the Arotman Research Institute but he had many key insights about remembering and how it works that's wonderful it sounds like you've had some amazing mentors and amazing role models along your journey in science and I love to hear about everyone's individual mentors and who inspired them and how they were inspired and it sounds like you know we keep coming back to this theme in a lot of different interviews that it's these people that you're working with closely these people who are kind of shaping your career from the ground floor and really sitting with you and teaching you things and when you think back on your career in science and your life in science is there a particular moment in time where you think you really started getting interested in science can you tell me kind of where your career in science or your interest in science started and then walk us through how you got to where you are today from that point okay my interest in memory let me deal with that first developed from very early childhood my mother died when I was five years old and of course that's a shock for young kid but then I discovered I could keep her alive in memory I could keep reliving certain events that I could remember about her experiences events and I can keep them alive today because I've repeatedly retrieved them over the years and so I discovered that early on and got me interested in how that happens why do some things fade away so rapidly my brother for example was three and a half years younger than I and he has no conscious memories of my mother whatsoever he was only one and a half when she died and so that first sparked my interest because I had those experiences and then I was really shocked to find later in life I'd always thought of that memory and wondered how it worked I was really shocked to discover there was a whole field in psychology devoted to this I took introductory psychology and then I discovered well there's a whole course here on learning and memory I have two courses and so I took those courses I also took a lot of social psychology or as much as I could at Washington Lee now what was I applying to graduate school and social psychology and was admitted at Yale for that but Yale was a very flexible place of those days it probably still is and they encouraged people to follow their proclivities and then I took Robert Crowder's course in learning and memory at Yale of course I'd already had some as an undergraduate and he and I really hit it off and so we started doing work together so I kind of switched from the social psychology program into the cognitive psychology program at Yale and then Indle Toulvin joined the faculty and he's met with a lot over the years but he can be a pretty tough cookie or at least pretend he is and so I took courses from him and he was very challenging we wrote essays every week and he would read essays in class he would read what you'd said and ask you to defend it I still have this vivid memory of the first essay I wrote was about what should a good theory and psychology of memory do so I wrote some boilerplate type of stuff and then he called me up and challenged me on it in class and I couldn't defend myself very well but he got me just thinking and I thought this isn't going to happen to me again so I stuck with the course a few people dropped it because they didn't like being browbeat in the middle of class but I enjoyed it and so it was part of matching with with him and he was a lot smarter and knew a lot more so it was fine but it helped bring you up to speed to show you what the field was like so I thought it was a formative experience so that happened at graduate school and then I went on for your university where I was an assistant professor but then Toulvin left Yale went back to the University of Toronto where they asked him to come be chair and the person teaching cognitive psychology there who was supposed to went on leave for years so he invited me up to teach at the University of Toronto for a year and that turned into two years and that was another tremendously formative experience University of Toronto at that point in time had concentration of the very best people in my field it was probably the leading center for the cognitive psychological study of human memory had besides Toulvin there was Fergus Craig Morris Moskowitz Bennett Murdoch Bob Lockhart Paul Coers it was kind of a who's who in my field and so getting to meet with them talk to them at the same time while I was teaching there really those two years I think really helped shape and change my direction and put me on a much stronger trajectory than I would have been if I just stayed at Purdue teaching my courses and then I went back to Purdue after those two years and rose to the rites there but it totally changed my direction of research having been in Toronto so then in 1988 I left for Rice University I like Purdue really well still do have lots of friends there but my son who was two years old developed diabetes and so my wife and I were looking to move to a place that had a diabetes and Houston did so we were very happy to go to Rice Rice is a wonderful year of university and I had eight fantastic years there and there's where I started researching false memory and developed a paradigm that's going on to be relatively successful and in 1988 Washington University in St. Louis approached me about possibly coming here to be chair of the department they just built a new psychology to building there were 14 people in the department and the dean and the chancellor told me if I were to come I could lead the department into the future and so it was a brand new building it was a time relatively speaking of retracement and higher education never been a chair before been asked a couple of times but it had always declined but this looked like a real opportunity to do something exciting so I came to Washington University and we doubled the size of the department over a period of about eight years from 14 people to I think it was 30 when I stepped down so we're doing lots of recruiting and again disproportionately in cognitive psychology and human memory although we recruited all areas in my department but that was great and I stepped down after eight years and that was 10 years ago we got a new chair and he kept propiling us forward too so it's really great experience being here but the university made it so that I could keep my research going pretty much full speed ahead while I was being chair they paid for me to hire a post-doc or fellow I had a couple of grants that clicked them and I had some very good collities with who my collaborated so actually I think if you looked at my video during the eight years when I was chair you wouldn't see too much difference between the period before that and the period after that so then since I stepped down as being chair I've been engaged in these kinds of research projects that I described to you and one additional one I got interested in applying cognitive psychology to education we know a lot about how memory works and the question is why doesn't more of this make it to the classroom psychology has been studying learning a memory for 115 years or more actually now it's more like 125 but if you ask me what common classroom practices do we now do because of what cognitive psychologists found the answers not much has changed in education or not much has changed because of psychology I watch education practices change thanks sweep through whole world learning the new mathematics all those kinds of things but the research base is often relatively thin or non-existent so people have a brand new idea but it hasn't been tested in the lab it hasn't been translated from the lab to the classroom and so what I've been proposing in recent years is what we might call translational educational science that is taking things that work in the laboratory with simple materials with say college students those are the people psychologically studying those are our drosophila if you will or just like drosophila I have these great characteristics for studying genetics and for neuroscience too well college students or expert memorizers if you're interested in memory these are the people to study that's how they got there they are shown they can learn and remember large amounts of information and so they're ideal subjects but in a way they're too good because they have perfected it so you have to make sure that what you find with college students will work with other people and will work with say things like textbook materials whereas psychologists often study simpler materials but we did that we studied certain things found that they worked in the lab we found they worked when we tried to year them up to more complicated materials and then I've had I mean one of the most transformative experiences of the last 10 or 15 years for me has been an idea that the McDonald's foundation had and they approached me saying we would like to use a former group of cognitive psychologists who are interested in applying what they do to education and some of them already doing that a little bit others weren't yet and so I formed this group of 11 individuals and the 11 of us received funding about nine million dollars over a 10 year period to do research and we met twice a year and discuss our research and many collaborations sprung up and still continue among our groups the usual grant situation is you have little groups are all competing for funding even if they're working on the same problem the idea here was here we'll give you the funding come together and collaborate and you'll make much more progress than you would have if you've been working in your little isolated chambers and it really came true it was just amazing that I look at the field now and I think really because of this grant because of the 11 of us but the many postdoctoral fellows many graduate students many undergraduates who came up through this pipeline who are also out now successfully doing research of this sort that it really transformed the field of the cognitive psychological study of education and so I have another grant from the Institute of Educational Sciences with Mark McDaniel and Kathleen McDermott and that grant is to take what we've learned and apply it in the classroom so we have had a wonderful classroom project at Columbia Middle School and Columbia High School and these are schools near St. Louis where we've been permitted to do experiments in the classroom trying to apply the same ideas with the materials and these are not special materials we told the teachers give us what your materials are we'll adapt them to our program and we'll try to improve student learning outcomes and we have that's all written up in our book make it sick as well as in a lot of journal articles of course so that's really been a wonderful experience for me absolutely I think you've had an amazing scientific journey and it's so great to hear how you evolved from this little five-year-old who is going through a very difficult time and becoming fascinated in memory and now how you've evolved all the way through your amazing career now to still be studying you know those key concepts that you're interested even at such a young age so that's an amazing story and I love what you're talking about being able to apply the research and what we're learning in the field of cognitive psychology to the actual learning experience within schools I think that is critical and I think like you said something that's kind of been missing with all these advances in the study we're missing that application to the real world so that's an amazing gap that you're filling there absolutely and we've talked about all these incredible accomplishments and the things that have inspired you and the people who have inspired you along the way but I think we haven't yet talked about any of the maybe struggles or these difficult points in your career so Roddy can you take us back to a time where you were struggling or you maybe had a major failure and tell us what was going on and how you worked through that difficult time sure actually I think I've been pretty well blessed and having one thing I haven't talked about in detail in this interview but every working scientist knows it is your students and your postdoctoral fellows who are students in some larger sense these are your allies in getting things done and if you're able to surround yourself with really bright and acquiring minds people trying to strike out on their own then it makes the task so much easier so often on I have struggled I think every scientist will tell you grant funding and the funding situation is really enough to make you despair today the government has cut back the sequester private foundations are like the James McDowell foundation are helping of course and many of the things I do are like say this new project on collective memory is there a government agency that would really care about collective memory maybe but it would be a stretch nobody's funding that kind of research now I propose that to the National Science Foundation which I'm thinking of doing I have no idea what kind of reception I'll get because it's totally out in the field for many things they've ever funded in psychology so funding is a constant struggle that we all have I've been fortunate but you know I think like most of us most of our grant proposals are turned down so even the most successful people I know frequently have papers rejected it's just a common academia and science you have to get used to relatively constant rejection it's just a fact of life that doesn't matter who you are I'll bet you Nobel Prize winners routinely have papers turned down some people have told me once you've achieved a certain status you have other people ready to bring you down and make you humble again and that's certainly been my experience that you know everybody thinks that oh you haven't made once you reach a certain level in your career let me assure you that's not true and I mean you have it made no sense but in terms of getting your grants funded or getting your papers published or attracting graduate students well it's a competitive world out there if everybody sees academia as a cloistered world but really it's highly competitive that professors are kind of entrepreneurs we're all out hunting for students for money for colleagues for ideas mostly a friendly environment although you can incredible horror stories I've never been caught up in too many of these personally but I have witnessed them one of my jobs is I'm chair of the publications committee of the American Psychological Society now and so I sometimes get caught in brush fires between authors and editors and authors who have one position and other authors who take a strongly different position and I watch the poor editors and try to advise them as they adjudicate these matters between critics and authors and you know so it can't get kind of bitter something that doesn't leak out into the public too much but science is a highly competitive enterprise and I think that's mostly for the good but sometimes it spills over a little bit too much absolutely I think it's reassuring or almost humbling for myself and for the listeners to hear someone as successful as you say that they've had struggles with funding or with getting papers accepted because like you said I think there is that mindset that once you've gotten to a certain point of your career you know everyone just thinks you're awesome but it's a there's a critical process like you said no matter where you are you're going to have critics and no matter who you are you're going to have critics and you're going to go through a lot of these same struggles that earlier or younger scientists are having as well so that's wonderful to hear and we don't want to just talk about failures today Roddy so I'd like to give you an opportunity next to tell us about a recent success that you've had and then maybe tell us just why it meant so much to you well my successors are often shared with my students and my colleagues because I collaborate a lot I rarely do anything totally on my own let me describe one project this will give me an opportunity to describe one project I haven't yet talked about I was asked to write a chapter totally out of the blue the MacArthur Foundation has a group that they were interested in sponsoring a set of workshops on law and psychology law and neuroscience and there was a meeting held in Tucson Arizona was organized by Lynn DeDel and Walter Senator Armstrong a psychologist and neuroscientist in the first hand philosopher on the second hand and they wrote me a letter saying we really like you to talk about and to write about the issue of confidence and memory and I wrote back and said well thanks for asking but surely you know I've never done any work on this issue not even as a side-ride and so I said why should you even ask me I'm just not the right one and I listed about five names of people who I thought would be much better than I would it's this and they wrote back and so all those people have very entrenched positions on one side of the debate or the other we'd like somebody who would be dispassion who hasn't worked in this area but whose judgment we trust to come in and review the evidence and tell us what they think so I was about to go on sabbatical and so I thought well this is kind of interesting so maybe this is something I could do because it really is an interesting problem here's the problem some people have claimed that confidence and memory are tightly correlated that if you remember something and you're really sure that it's almost certain to be right and if you remember something and you're unsure it's probably much more likely to be error-prone but there was another group of psychologists at the same time claiming these are people who study especially I witnessed testimony in legal situations and they were claiming that confidence and accuracy were essentially uncarlated that the confidence of a witness in saying that's the person who committed the crime I'll never forget that face that that person could be no more believed that a person who said oh that looks familiar that might be the person but I'm not really sure in other words the confidence and accuracy didn't track each other so it's a huge question and it really matters in the law because if you look at the case of the people who've been wrongly convicted in courts of law and now convictions have been overturned they've been exonerated through DNA analysis which was not possible before 1995 75% of those wrong convictions were based on eyewitness identification of people who are highly confident and said I'll never forget that face that's who did it that's who committed the murder or whatever and so the whole issue of confidence and accuracy is one that really matters so I did like this chapter do this analysis with a graduate student named Andy DeSoto and a colleague of mine from University of California at San Diego whose name is John Wicksden and we wrote a chapter together showing that after doing all the literature there are actually at least five different ways of asking the confidence accuracy question and they don't have to agree and then Andy and Andy DeSoto we began doing a project trying to show that in one paradigm one single experimental paradigm we could find positive correlations between confidence and accuracy we could find zero correlations between confidence and accuracy this is again depending on the analysis we use and in fact we also found cases of negative correlations between confidence and accuracy the more likely you are to make an error the more you believe it these are cases of similarity where when you're trying to recognize something is very similar to what you saw but it isn't what you saw and then you're very likely to make an error and you're very likely to believe that the error is correct so to me this was a recent success we just published two papers and back just came out this year and two journals Andy DeSoto and I did showing how we could get within the same experimental paradigm both positive negative and zero correlations between confidence and memory so let me let that represent a success sure that sounds like a fascinating project and a really interesting twist on some of those things that you're sort of studying but like you said it wasn't even an area that you had really dipped into in terms of researching heavily prior to this request so that's very interesting here's one tip so early on in my career well increasingly over my career I think a lot of people get more conservative something is not right down their hallway they kind of ignored I found over the last 15 or 20 years when people write to me out of the blue I mean you can't do everything but often I've gotten new exciting directions because I chased after something new like meeting this anthropologist here who was interested in collective memory and I would listen to him and think well I could study that empirically I could take what he's doing based on more or less case studies and I could convert that into an empirical project or in this case where I was offered the opportunity to think about confidence and memory and instead of just saying no that's not what I do I said yes I've got some time coming up I'll work on that and so to me I wish I'd done that more earlier in my career I think then I sort of said well I'm studying these two or three things I'm gonna study them to death and I wish I'd start branching out sooner actually I did when I went to the University of Toronto on sabbatical that was one thing that helped me there there were lots of new ideas in the air and I switched out my journal advice to young people coming up as watch for opportunities and seize them you can't do it every time so you have to use judgment as to what makes sense for you and what doesn't but to me it's been a very good strategy and keep you going I watch people my age mid 60s and some of them been doing the same thing for the last 15 years same problem same methods same everything and to me I like to switch topics every few years I just still do work on false memories in fact the negative correlation between confidence and accuracy is an example of very powerful false memories but to me it's been good to and you know not no one scientific style fits everybody I have an admiration for the people who have had doggy pursuit of a problem for 20 years there's something to admire there and often they make great progress but for me at the risk of being in donatimes I like to keep several different lines of research in different areas going at once certainly sometimes it's nice to get a little bit of variety in terms of the things that you're spending your time thinking about or the different things you're working on or even the people that you're working with so I think that's great advice or great tip to kind of throw out there and and one of the questions I like to ask everybody is whether they have a particular book that they've read maybe recently that they really enjoyed and would recommend to our listeners it can be a science book or a non science book a book I like very much about memory is Indle Tulpings book it's an old one now from 1983 but I think he has a lot of wisdom in there and the book's been cited several thousand times so I guess a lot of other people think so too it's called elements of episodic memory but that's really a particular to my field my own other reading habits are I like biographies I'm in the middle of books about World War 2 now like Jeff Sharers books about the Civil War the Revolutionary War and World War 2 those are fictional but he does a good job of basing them on facts so I've been interested in that and it informing me in some ways in my work on collective memory and this is how I see my journal reading sometimes informing my work because so many books are about memory one way or the other whether there are novels and people have memories in the novels and I talked to a novelist once and he was saying that he thinks about memory all the time because when you watch them do your characters with memories you can't make them 2G tales you can't make them too precise because that's not the way memory works but on the other hand you do want them to be realistic so he has to worry even in his novels how people are remembering which I've never thought about before but interesting case the particular interest I have I kind of wondering away from your question about books but how this informed me was I read a book by a colleague of mine Jim works called voices of collective memory and I was really struck in the book about something he did an experiment that we're now going to do this summer more formally but here was this little experiment in his book he interviewed Russian teenagers about World War 2 tell the story of World War 2 so we could ask people in the United States to do that I fact I've done that in experiments and they come up with a scenario of roughly the same seven or eight things they talk about bombing the Pearl Harbor they might talk about Midway they're almost always talk about G day then they talk about the Holocaust and they talk about the final collapse in Berlin when the Allies were victorious there then they talk about dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that's the end of the war and when you hear that scenario one theme that runs through it is kind of how the US won World War 2 when Jim War 2 studies people in Russia and Russian national memory and national character ask the same question there he gets a very stereotype set of events and they have zero overlap with the US set of events that they have the battle of Stalin grant and the German invasion of Russia it was really interesting to me because of the way collective memories are used in different countries and so from that book I got really interested in starting a whole new line of work I think that's really interesting and I myself like you said never really thought about individual memories portrayed in books or novels and I think that's something that now I'm going to be keeping in the back of my mind is I'm reading fictional accounts of memory and things like that just how they're portraying them with like you said not too much detail you know vague occurrences but that's really interesting and and I think that applies to like you said collective memory as well and just thinking about the particular viewpoint from which the collective memories are coming from like you were exciting in your example the US versus Russian collective memory of the events of the war that's really really interesting and I think one of the amazing things about science that we have not really had a chance to talk about is the opportunity to travel so sometimes you're traveling to either work with colleagues or collaborators or to go to conferences to present your research things like that Roddy do you have a particular travel memory that is just stuck in your mind that you think is your favorite travel experience and can you tell us where you were and just what made that memory so wonderful for you and of course this is your area of expertise the world of memories I have trouble living in just one that's really working very vivid experience I was invited to go with my wife who's also a psychologist Catholic and McDermott we're invited to go to the University of Arhus in Denmark to spend about five weeks there one summer and they post up on campus and I was like the mill of working on several papers so it gave me a real opportunity to sit there right it was very interesting we would get up at Denmark time and then I wouldn't get any email until about three or so Denmark time because that was when people in the US were getting up and getting their computers so I had I kind of got most of the work done during the day before anybody started bothering me on email so that was nice and just the whole experiencing Denmark for just a month or so it was just fascinating especially in the summer there for the summer solstice which is the big celebration dating back to pagan days of the longest day of the year and the custom in Denmark we were living at Arhus right on the coast and we would go down and every few hundred yards there would be a bonfire on the coast and the entire city would come out and the sun doesn't go down on that day it goes down 11 30 or so at night and comes back up about two in the morning so it's almost perpetual daylight in fact I had to wear ice-hates to try to sleep while I was there because it was just so much daylight but it was very exhilarating I found that it didn't need as much sleep and it was just a wonderful experience and the Danish people are the country that whenever they do life satisfaction surveys that shows them coming up very high in fact number one usually all those kinds of surveys which I didn't really experience when I was there people seem quite satisfied with life of course I mostly knew academics and they also make it very easy for English speakers because everybody now learns English starting in grammar school so I knew no Danish but almost everybody would get long there was only one taxi driver who was probably my age who didn't speak much English but other than that everybody seemed to know English so it's a wonderful place to visit so we had a great experience there I was able to finish several projects I was working on they had a conference while we were there people came from all over especially Europe to this conference so a wonderful experience that sounds like an incredible travel opportunity and just be able to spend a month in a place I think is an amazing opportunity because at that point you really get to experience the culture you get to get out you know beyond the sort of typical sightseeing you know four or five things that you try and catch before you're flying out of town again so I think that is fantastic so while we're talking about your fun science memories Roddy I think one of the things that's really enjoyable about working in labs and working with different lab groups is that you get these funny science memories that come out of it because you're working with a lot of these amazing creative and oftentimes very funny people do you have one of those memories or one of those traditions that you could share with us today sure I was visiting professor at the University of Toronto for several years when I was an assistant professor and so I attended lab meetings of Indole Tulving who was there whose book I just mentioned a moment ago he was working on this book about that time and his tradition at lab meetings mine are we usually assign something to read or I have people report on data but at the time I was missing his lab there was no plan each day we would meet and he would just slap his hand on the table and whoever started talking first would dominate for the day so if you had something you wanted to talk about you had to jump in and it was all good nature but one thing I very much enjoyed was there was a man named Michael Waskins who was a post-shock who fell out at that time and he and Tulving I think they admired each other greatly but they loved to argue and fight and I'd never quite seen it in this way that if one of them said it's a nice day outside the other we were taking office at point of view we often have very interesting lab meetings because no matter what it was it was almost like a devil's advocate situation but he got a thought of thinking and and we always then chime in the fun so it was an interesting case where there was no plan for lab meetings except for ones that existed in our minds when we walked in other days Tulving would just call us so you kind of always had to be prepared what had you been thinking about the last week tell us about where did the region last week tell us about so you were kind of always on edge you didn't know what was going to happen so you had to be prepared for anything so it's very enjoyable it was a very good lab group at that time people who are now imminent my field with grandchildren so it was a very stimulating time that sounds like a fantastic way to run lab meeting I like that whoever can talk the loudest and whoever can talk first is the one that gets the talk so people start bringing megaphone's in no usually we talk about true and three different things and any given lab meeting but it was very entertaining and I learned it also a lot from doing it definitely and get to maybe practice your debate skills a little bit playing devil's advocate there and I thought I'd tell students when they come that the best education they will get is at lab meetings it's not in their courses it's from day to day seeing how projection develop seeing an idea that emerges from a lab meeting I've got lots of papers that have emerged from lab meetings and so my students when something would come up in a lab meeting we wouldn't have thought of it had we not all been in the room talking and debating but then some idea comes up and then somebody will run with that idea and take it out and test it so I think lab meetings are where the greatest part of graduate education occurs and shortly it's my own continuing education absolutely you get all those brilliant minds in one room you never know what's going to come out of it so Roddy the next question I want to ask is actually one of my favorites and this question is more of a hypothetical so can you tell me if funding staff technology and feasibility all of these things were not an issue is there one research question that you are just dying to know the answer to what has will continue to affect me what I would really do if I had as you say all this money would be to do worldwide surveys of memory that so much of my field is driven by what students do there are just softwares we have college shoes but often people ask well how do you know if what you're finding would generalize to a wider population and I think it does but usually it's an article of faith but now given the worldwide web and the fact that so many people are on computers yes they are mostly professional people almost by definition if you have a computer you're not really poor but it's still permitting us to test a much wider group of people than we ever have before and so we're using now several services one's it's an Amazon product called mechanical Turk and we're testing thousands of people all around the world using mechanical Turk they have to know English pretty well for us to test them and so there's still some limitations but if I had all this money and the resources you're talking about I would be very interested in doing experiments across cultures and across countries as to whether or not the principles and rules of memory that we're studying world generalize so far we've done quite a bit of work and I was very skeptical of mechanical Turk at first it's by the way just a testing mechanism that Amazon puts together where people do surveys they do experiments they do whatever you ask them to do they volunteer for it then they win points which go to money on the Amazon system so they can buy things that's why they're doing it but they do it from all over the world we did one study where we had and also a lot of people from Peru signed up interestingly and so we've gotten very large samples in one experiment with got over 50,000 people from all over this is one screening for people was superior memory abilities trying to find them all over the world this was actually done on Facebook more than mechanical Turk although we did have some people from there so I would use this amount of money to study collective memory worldwide and also just to assure ourselves that much of what we found in the last 140 years of my field really does generalize across people I'm pretty sure it does but I would really like to know for a fact because I think it's one of the biggest general criticism of my field that is based on people who have very good memories of the first place namely college students absolutely I think that's a fantastic question and a fantastic global approach to take to be able to compare across cultures like you said and also you know that's something where as a college student I always participated in those memory studies and you do kind of wonder you know for the most part I think it's accepted that these sorts of things can transfer to a broader population but yeah it is always good to just be able to say with certainty that we know that this is the case so I think that is a fantastic research question to pose so Roddy we'd love to end this interview today with one last piece of advice or one last piece of inspiration that you could share with our audience I think I'm going to repeat something I said earlier but something people might have told me this but when you see an opportunity to take it that many times really my career people would suggest oh let's collaborate on this let's collaborate on that but wasn't quite what I was doing it wasn't in my narrow focus of attention and as I age I discovered that the more I took a risk the more like this collective memory stuff I came to Washington University and I had a friend here I'd never heard the phrase collective memory I think before I got here and then he started talking about then I got really interested well I think of when I was in my late 20s and early 30s I was decided oh that's way too far I feel I won't do that and I've just discovered over the years that some of the best opportunities the best publications I've had have been when I went outside my comfort zone and tried to apply the research techniques that I knew to something brand new and that's what I'm trying to do now with collective memory also with studying memory athletes and other things that I wouldn't have thought I would be doing 20 years ago absolutely that's fantastic advice to really go out there and embrace the opportunities that are given to you even if they're outside of your immediate scope of what you've been working on and Roddy thank you so much for joining us today sure and listeners thank you for stopping by today to meet another fascinating researcher if there's a
