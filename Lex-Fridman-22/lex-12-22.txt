The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, a computer scientist, mathematician, and theoretical physicist who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics project. He's the author of several books including a new kind of science, which, on a personal note, was one of the most influential books in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence. It made me fall in love with the mathematical beauty and power of cellular automata. It is true that perhaps one of the criticisms of Stephen is at a human level, that he has a big ego, which prevents some researchers from fully enjoying the content of his ideas. We talk about this point in this conversation. To me, ego can lead your stray, but can also be a superpower, one that fuels bold, innovative thinking that refuses to surrender to the cautious ways of academic institutions. And here, especially, I ask you to join me in looking past the peculiarities of human nature and opening your mind to the beauty of ideas and Stephen's work and in this conversation. I believe Stephen Wolfram is one of the most original minds of our time, and at the core is a kind, curious, and brilliant human being. This conversation was recorded in November 2019, when the Wolfram Physics project was underway, but not yet ready for public exploration as it is now. We now agree to talk again, probably multiple times in the near future, so this is round one, and stay tuned for round two soon. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

So let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question, but if aliens were to visit us on Earth, do you think we would be able to find a common language? Well, by the time we're saying aliens are visiting us, we've already prejudiced the whole story. Because the concept of an alien actually visiting, so to speak, we already know there are things that make sense to talk about visiting. So we already know they exist in the same kind of physical setup that we do. They're not just radio signals. It's an actual thing that shows up and so on. So I think in terms of, you know, can one find ways to communicate? Well, the best example we have of this right now is AI. I mean, that's our first sort of example of alien intelligence. And the question is, how well do we communicate with AI? You know, if you were to say, if you were in the middle of a neural net and you open it up and it's like, what are you thinking? Can you discuss things with it? It's not easy, but it's not absolutely impossible. So I think by the time given the setup of your question, aliens visiting, I think the answer is, yes, one will be able to find some form of communication, whatever communication means, communication requires notions of purpose and things like this. It's a kind of philosophical quagmire. So if AI is a kind of alien life form, what do you think visiting looks like? So if we look at aliens visiting, and we'll get to discuss computation and the world of computation, but if you were to imagine, you said, you're already pressured to something by saying you visit, but how would aliens visit? By visit, there's kind of an implication on here where using the imprecision of human language, in a world of the future, if that's represented in computational language, we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation basically and find out exactly what does that mean, what properties does it have and so on. But by visit, in ordinary human language, I'm kind of taking it to be there's something, a physical embodiment that shows up in a spacecraft since we kind of know that that's necessary. We're not imagining it's just photons showing up in a radio signal that um you know a photons in some very elaborate pattern, we're imagining it's it's physical things made of atoms and so on that show up. Can it be photons in a pattern? Well that's good question. I mean whether there is the possibility you know what counts as intelligence, good question. I mean it's some you know and I used to think there was sort of a oh there'll be you know it'll be clear what it means to find extraterrestrial intelligence etc etc etc. I've increasingly realized as a result of science that I've done that there really isn't a bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational so to speak. So you know in our kind of everyday sort of discussion we'll say things like you know the weather has a mind of its own. Well we let's unpack that question you know we realize that there are computational processes that go on that determine the fluid dynamics of this and that and the atmosphere etc etc etc. How do we distinguish distinguish that from the processes that go on in our brains of you know the physical processes that go on in our brains? How do we how do we how do we separate those? How do we say the the physical processes going on that represents sophisticated computations in the weather? Oh that's not the same as the physical processes that go on that represent sophisticated computations in our brains. The answer is I don't think there is a fundamental distinction. I think the distinction for us is that there's kind of a a thread of of history and so on that connects kind of what happens in different brains to each other so to speak and it's a you know what happens in the weather is something which is not connected by sort of a thread of of a civilizational history so to speak to what we're used to in our story in the stories that the human brain told us but maybe the weather has its own stories that's absolutely absolutely and that's and that's what we run into trouble thinking about extraterrestrial intelligence because you know it's like that pulsar magnetosphere that's generating these very elaborate radio signals you know is that something that we should think of as being this whole civilization that's developed over the last however long you know millions of years of of of processes going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what you know what we're used to in human intelligence. I mean I think it's a I think in the end you know when people talk about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it in the whole you know Fermi paradox of how come there's no other signs of intelligence in the universe my guess is that we've got sort of two alien forms of intelligence that we're dealing with artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrial intelligence and my guess is people will sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achieved around the same time and in other words people will say well yes we're used to computers things we've created digital things we've created being sort of intelligent like we are and they'll say we're kind of also used to the idea that there are things around the universe that are kind of intelligent like we are except they don't share the sort of civilizational history that we have and so we don't they know they're there are different branch I mean it's similar to when you talk about life for instance I mean you you you kind of said life for my think almost synonymously with intelligence which I don't think is is you know I the the AIs will be upset to hear you I quite those because I really probably implied biological life right right right but you're saying I mean we'll explore this more but you're saying it's really a spectrum and it's all just a kind of computation and so it's it's a full spectrum and we just make ourselves special by weaving a narrative around our particular kinds of computation yes I mean the thing that I think I've kind of come to realises you know at some levels a little depressing to realise that there's there's so little that's celebrating well yeah but I mean it's you know it's the story of science right and you know from Copernicus on it's like you know first we were like convinced our planets at the center of the universe yeah no that's not true well then we were convinced there's something very special about the chemistry that we have as biological organisms that's not really true and then we're still holding out that hope oh this intelligence thing we have that's really special yeah I don't think it is however in a sense as you say it's kind of liberating for the following reason that you realise that what special is the details of us not some abstract attribute that you know we could wonder oh is something else going to come along and you know also have that abstract attribute well yes every abstract attribute we have something else has it but the full details of our kind of history of our civilisation and so on nothing else has that that's what you know that's our story so to speak and that's sort of almost by definition special so I view it as not being such a I mean I was initially I was like this is bad this is this is kind of you know how can we have self-respect about some about the things that we do then I realised the details of the things we do they all the story everything else is kind of a blank canvas so maybe on a small tangent you just made me think of it but what do you make of the monoliths in 2001 space Odyssey in terms of aliens communicating with us and sparking the the kind of particular intelligent computation that we humans have is there anything interesting to get from that sci-fi yeah I mean I think what's what's fun about that is you know the monoliths are these you know one to four to nine perfect cuboid things and in the you know earth were million years ago whatever they were portraying with a with a bunch of apes and so on a thing that has that level of perfection seems out of place it seems very kind of constructed very engineered so that's an interesting question what is the you know what's the techno signature so to speak what is it that you see it somewhere and you say my gosh that had to be engineered now the fact is we see crystals which are also very perfect and you know the perfect ones are very perfect they're nice polyhedra or whatever and so in that sense if you say well it's a sign of sort of it's a techno signature that it's a perfect you know a perfect polygonal shape polyhedrial shape that's not true and so then it's it's an interesting question what what is the you know what is the right signature I mean like you know Gauss famous mathematician you know he had this idea you should cut down the Siberian forest and the shape of sort of a typical image of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem on the grounds that as a kind of cool idea didn't get done but you know it's on the grounds that the Martians would see that and realize gosh there are mathematicians out there it's kind of you know it's the in his theory of the world that was probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievements of our species but you know it's it's a it's a reasonable question what do you what can you send or create that is a sign of intelligence in its creation or even intention in its creation can you talk about if we were to send a beacon can you can you what what should we send is math our greatest creation is uh what is our greatest creation I think I think and it's a it's a philosophically doomed issue to I mean in other words you send something you think it's fantastic but it's kind of like we are part of the universe we make things that are you know things that happen in the universe computation which is sort of the thing that we are in some abstract and and since using to create all these elaborate things we create is surprisingly ubiquitous in other words we might have thought that you know we've built this whole giant engineering stack that's led us to microprocessors that's led us to be able to do elaborate computations but this idea the computations are happening all over the place the only question is whether whether there's a thread that connects our human intentions to what those computations are and so I think I think this question of what do you send to kind of show off our civilization in the best possible way I think any kind of almost random slab of stuff we've produced is about equivalence everything else I think it's one of these things where it's a non-romantic way of phrasing it I just started to interrupt but I just talked to Andrew in who's the wife of cross singing uh-huh and so I don't know if you're familiar with the voyager I mean she was part of sending I think brain waves of you know what was it hers yeah her brain waves when she was first falling in love with Carl Sagan right it's a beautiful story right that perhaps you would shut down the power of that by saying we might as well send anything else and that's interesting all of it is kind of an interesting peculiar thing that's yeah yeah right well I mean I think it's kind of interesting to see on the on the voyager you know golden record thing one of the things that's kind of cute about that is you know it was made one was it in the late 70s early 80s yeah um and you know one of the things it's a phonograph record okay and it has a diagram of how to play a phonograph record and uh you know it's kind of like it's shocking that in just 30 years if you show that to a random kid of today and you show them that diagram and I've tried this experiment they're like I don't know what the heck this is and the best anybody can think of is you know take the whole record forget the fact that it has some kind of helical track in it just image the whole thing and see what's there that's what we would do today in only 30 years our technology has kind of advanced to the point where the playing of a helical you know mechanical track on a phonograph record is now something bizarre so you know it's it's a that's a cautionary tale I would say in terms of the ability to make something that in detail sort of leads by the nose some you know the aliens or whatever to do something it's like no you you know best you're going to do as I say if we were doing this today we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle we would just take some high resolution imaging system and get all the bits off it and say oh it's a big nuisance that they put in the helix you know let's spiral let's them let's just you know unravel the spiral and um install it from there do you think and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of AI interpretability of computation being able to communicate with various kinds of computations do you think we'd be able to if you're put put your alien hat figure out this record how to play this record well it's a question of what one wants to do I mean understand what the other party was trying to communicate or understand anything about the other party what does understanding mean I mean that's the issue the issue is it's like when people were trying to do natural language understanding for computers right so people try to do that for years it wasn't clear what it meant in other words you take your piece of English or whatever and you say gosh my computer has understood this okay that's nice what can you do with that well so for example when we did you know built with malpha um you know one of the things was it's you know it's doing question answering and so on and it needs to do natural language understanding the reason that I realized after the fact the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well and people hadn't before the number one thing was we had an actual objective for the natural language understanding we were trying to turn the natural language into computation into this computational language that we could then do things with now similarly when you imagine your alien you say okay we're playing them the record did they understand it well depends what you mean if they you know if we if there's a representation that they have if it converts to some representation what we can say oh yes that is a that's a representation that we can recognize is represents understanding then all well and good but actually the only ones that I think we can say would represent understanding a ones that will then do things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us maybe trying to understand quantify how technologically advanced this particular civilization is so are they a threat to us from a military perspective yeah that's probably the kind of first kind of understanding that'll be interested in gosh that's so hot I mean that's like in the arrival movie that was sort of one of the key questions is is you know why are you here so to speak and it's I even heard us right but but even that is you know it's a very unclear you know it's like the the are you gonna hurt us that comes back to a lot of interesting AI ethics questions because the you know we might make an AI that says but take autonomous cars for instance you know are you gonna hurt us well let's make sure you only drive it precisely to the speed limit because we want to make sure we don't hurt you so to speak because that's some and then well something you know but you say but actually that means I'm gonna be really late for this thing and you know that sort of hurts me in some way so it's hard to know even even the definition of what it means to hurt yeah someone is unclear and as we start thinking about things about AI ethics and so on that's you know something one has to address there's always trade-offs and that's the annoying thing about ethics yeah well right and I mean I think ethics like these other things we're talking about is a deeply human thing there's no abstract you know let's write down the theorem that proves that this is ethically correct that's a that's a meaningless idea you know you have to have a ground truth so to speak that's ultimately sort of what humans want and they don't all want the same thing so that gives one all kinds of additional complexity and thinking about that one convenient thing in terms of turning ethics into computation and ask the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the survival of the species yeah that's a good existential issue yeah but then when you say survival of the species right you might say um you might for example for example let's say forget about technology just you know hang out and you know be happy live our lives go into the next generation you know go through many many generations where in a sense nothing is happening that okay is that not okay hard to know in terms of you know the the attempt to do elaborate things and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of the species like for instance I mean in in you know I think it's it's also a little bit hard to know so okay let's take that as a sort of thought experiment okay you know you can say well uh what are the threats that we might have to survive you know the super okay now the asteroid impact the um you know all these kinds of things okay so now we inventory these possible threats and we say let's make our species as robust as possible relative to all these threats I think in the end it's a it's sort of an unknowable thing what um uh what it takes to uh you know so so given that you've got this AI and you've told it maximize the long term what does long term mean does long term mean until the sun burns out that's that's not gonna work you know does long term mean next thousand years okay they're probably optimizations for the next thousand years that uh it's like it's like if you're running a company you can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time like if you know if your company gets uh bought by some you know private investment group then they'll uh you know you can you can run a company just fine for five years by just taking what it does and you know removing all R&D and um uh the company will burn out after a while but it'll run just fine for a while so if you tell the AI keep the humans okay for a thousand years there's probably a certain set of things that one would do to optimize that many of which one might say well that would be a pretty big shame for the future of history so to speak for that to be what happens but I think I think in the end you know as you start thinking about that question it is um uh what you realize is there's a whole sort of raft of undecided ability computational irreducibility in other words it's I mean one of the good things about sort of the the the what our civilization has gone through and what sort of we humans go is that there's a certain computational irreducibility to it in the sense that it isn't the case that you can look from the outside and just say the answer is going to be this at the end of the day this is what's going to happen you actually have to go through the process to find out and I think that's um that's both that feels better in the sense it's not a you know something is achieved by going through all of this uh uh all of all of this process and um it's uh uh uh but it also means that telling the AI go figure out you know what will be the best outcome well unfortunately it's going to come back and say it's kind of undecidable what to do we'd have to run all of those scenarios um to see what happens and if we want it for the infinite future we're throwing immediately into sort of standard issues of of kind of infinite computation and so on so yeah even if you get that the answer to the universe and everything is 42 you still have to actually run the universe yes to to figure out like the question I guess or the the you know the the journey is the point right well I think it's saying to summarize this is the result of the universe yeah that's if that is possible it tells us I mean the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation and so on and thinking about how stuff works if if they're if it's possible to say and the answer is such and such you're basically saying there's a way of going outside the universe and you're kind of you're getting yourself into something of a sort of paradox because you're saying if it's knowable what the answer is then there's a way to know it that is beyond what the universe provides but if we can know it then something that we're dealing with is beyond the universe so then the universe isn't the universe so to speak so and in general as as we'll talk about at least far small human brains it's hard to show that the result of a sufficiently complex computation it's hard I mean it's probably impossible right on this side ability so and the universe appears by at least the poets to be sufficiently complex they won't be able to predict what the heck it's all going to well we better not be able to because if we can it kind of denies I mean it's you know we're part of the universe yeah so what does it mean for us to predict it means that we that our little part of the universe is able to jump ahead of the whole universe and you know this this quickly winds up I mean that there it is conceivable the only way we'd be able to predict is if we are so special in the universe we are the one place where there is computation more special more sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe that's the only way we would have the ability to sort of the almost theological abilities so to speak to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we're we're better than everything else in the universe which I don't think is the case yeah perhaps we can detect a large number of looping patterns that re-occur throughout the universe and fully describe them and therefore but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns interact and what kind of well look the most remarkable thing about the universe is that it's has regularity at all might not be the case if you just have regularity absolutely there if it's full of I mean physics is successful you know it's full of of laws that tell us a lot of detail about how the universe works I mean it could be the case that you know the 10 to the 90th particles in the universe they will do their own thing but they don't they all follow we already know they all follow basically physical the same physical laws and that's something that's a very profound fact about the universe what conclusively draw from that is unclear I mean in the you know the early early theologians that was you know exhibit number one for the existence of God right now you know people have different conclusions about it but the fact is you know right now I mean I happen to be interested actually I've just restarted a long running kind of interest of mine about fundamental physics I'm kind of like go on I'm on a bit of a quest which I'm about to make more public to see if I can actually find the fundamental theory physics excellence we'll come to that and I just had a lot of conversations with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm really excited on your take because I think you have a fascinating take on the the the the fundamental to nature of our reality from a physics perspective so and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today okay let's take a step back what is computation it's a good question operationally computation is following rules that's kind of it I mean computation is the result is the process of systematically following rules and it is the thing that happens when you do that so taking initial conditions are taking inputs and following rules I mean what are you following rules on so there has to be some data some not necessarily it can be something where that there's a you know very simple input and then you're following these rules and you'd say there's not really much data going into this it's you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule if you want to so I think the the question is is there robust notion of computation that is what is robust what I mean by that is something like this so so one of the things in a different in another physics something like energy okay they're different forms of energy there's but somehow energy is a robust concept that doesn't isn't particular to kinetic energy or you know nuclear energy or whatever else there's a robust idea of energy so one of the things you might ask is there's the robust idea of computation or does it matter that this computation is running in a Turing machine this computation is running in a you know CMOS silicon CPU this computation is running in a fluid system in the weather those kinds of things or is there a robust idea of computation that transcends the sort of detailed framework that it's running in okay and is there yes I mean it wasn't obvious that there was so it's worth understanding the history and how we got to where we are right now because you know to say that there is is a statement in part about our universe it's not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable it's about what actually can exist for us maybe you can also comment because energy as a concept is robust but there's also so it's intricate complicated relationship with matter with mass is very interesting of particles that carry force and particles that sort of particles that carry force and particles that have mass these kinds of ideas they seem to map to each other at least in the mathematical sense is there a connection between energy and mass and computation or these completed disjoint ideas we don't know yet the things that I'm trying to do about fundamental physics may well lead to such a connection but there is no known connection at this time so can you elaborate a little bit more on what how do you think about computation what is computation yeah so I mean let's let's tell a little bit of a historical story yes okay so you know back go back 150 years people were making mechanical calculators of various kinds and you know the typical thing was you want an adding machine you go to the adding machine store basically you want a multiplying machine you go to the multiplying machine store that different pieces of hardware and so that means that at least at the level of that kind of computation and those kinds of pieces of hardware there isn't a robust notion of computation there's the adding machine kind of computation there's a multiplying machine notion of computation and their disjoint so what happened in around 1900 people started imagining particularly in the context of mathematical logic could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function right and they came up with things this idea of primitive recursion was one of the early ideas and it didn't work there were reasonable functions that people could come up with that were not represented using the primitives of primitive recursion okay so then then along comes 1931 and girdle theorem and so on and as in looking back one can see that as part of the process of establishing girdle theorem girdle basically showed how you could compile arithmetic you how you could basically compile logical statements like this statement is improvable into arithmetic so what he essentially did was to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sense that's capable of representing all kinds of other things and then Turing came along 1936 came up with Turing machines meanwhile the Lonzo Church had come up with lambda calculus and the surprising thing that was established very quickly is the Turing machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same as the lambda calculus idea of what computation might be and so and then there started to be other ideas you know register machines are the kinds of other kinds of representations of computation and the big surprise was they all turned out to be equivalent so in other words it might have been the case like those old adding machines and multiplying machines that you know Turing had his idea of computation church had his idea of computation and they were just different but it isn't true they're actually all equivalent so then by I would say the the oh 1970s or so in sort of the computation computer science computation theory area people had sort of said oh Turing machines are kind of what computation is physicists were still holding out saying no no it's just not how the universe works we've got all these differential equations we've got all these real numbers that have infinite numbers of digits the universe is not a Turing machine right the you know the Turing machines are a small subset of that are the things that we make in microprocessors and engineering structures and so on so probably actually through my work in the 1980s about sort of the relationship between computation and models of physics it became a little less clear that there would be that there was this big sort of dichotomy between what can happen in physics and what happens in things like Turing machines and I think probably by now people would mostly think and by the way brains were another kind of elements of this I mean you know Gurdle didn't think that his notion of computation or what amounted to his notion of computation would cover brains and Turing wasn't sure either but although he was a little bit he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains but so you know but I would say by probably sometime in the 1980s there was beginning to be sort of a general belief that yes this notion of computation that could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust now the next question is okay you can have a universal Turing machine that's capable of being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do and you know this idea of universal computation it's an important idea this idea that you can have one piece of hardware and program it with different pieces of software you know that's kind of the idea that launched most modern technology I mean that's kind of that that's the idea that launched computer revolution software etc so important idea but but the thing that's still kind of holding out from that idea is okay there is this universal computation thing but seems hard to get to seems like you want to make a universal computer you have to kind of have a microprocessor with you know a million gates in it and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that level of computational sophistication okay so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered in the early 80s I'm looking at these things called cellular automata which are really simple computational systems the thing that was a big surprise to me was that even when their rules were very very simple they were doing things that were as sophisticated as they did when their rules were much more complicated so it didn't look like you know this idea oh to get sophisticated computation you have to build something with very sophisticated rules that idea didn't seem to pan out and instead it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous even in systems with incredibly simple rules and so that led to this thing that I call the principle of computational equivalence which basically says when you have a system that follows rules of of of any kind then whenever the system isn't doing things that are in some sense obviously simple then the computation that the behavior of the system corresponds to is of equivalence sophistication so that means that when you kind of go from the very very very simplest things you can imagine then quite quickly you hit this kind of threshold above which everything is equivalent in its computational sophistication not obvious that would be the case I mean that's a science fact well and then a whole line a second you so this you've opened with the new kind of science I mean I remember it was a huge eye opener that's such simple things can create such complexity and yes there's an equivalence but it's not a fact it just appears to I mean as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegant that it seems to be the way things are but let me ask sort of you just brought up previously kind of like the communities of computer scientists with their tory machines the physicist with their universe and the whoever the heck maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain what's your sense in the equivalence you've shown through your work that simple rules can create equivalently complex tory machine systems right is the universe equivalent to the kinds of tutorial machines is the human brain a kind of toy machine do you see those things basically blending together or is there still a mystery about how does joint air well my guess is that they all blend together but we don't know that for sure yet I mean this I you know I should say I said rather globally that the principle of computational equivalence is sort of a science fact and I was using air quotes yes for the for the for the science fact because when you it is a I mean just to talk about that for a second of the multiple will the thing is that it is it has a complicated epistemological character similar to things like the second law of thermodynamics the law of entropy increase the you know what is the second law of thermodynamics it is is it a law of nature is it a thing that is true of the physical world is it is it something which is mathematically provable is it something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world is it in some sense a definition of heat perhaps well it's a combination of those things and it's the same thing with the principle of computational equivalence and in some sense the principle of computational equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation because it's telling you there is a thing there is a robust notion that is equivalence across all these systems and doesn't depend on the details of each individual system and that's why we can meaningfully talk about a thing called computation and we're not stuck talking about oh there's computation in Turing machine number 3785 and etc etc etc that's that's why there is a robust notion like that now on the other hand can we prove the principle of computational equivalence can we can we prove it as a mathematical result well the answer is actually we've got some nice results along those lines that say you know throw me a random system with very simple rules well in a couple of cases we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain type are universal and do sort of follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalence so that's a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence just a little bit on that point the simple rules creating sort of these complex behaviors but is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex that you've you mentioned you cross a threshold right so the various indicators so for example one thing would be is it capable of universal computation that is given the system do there exist initial conditions for the system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do anything you want to compute primes to compute pi to do whatever you want right so that's an indicator so we know in a couple of examples that yes the simplest candidates that could conceivably have that property do have that property and that's what the principle of computational equivalence might suggest but this principle of computational equivalence one question about it is is it true for the physical world right it might be true for all these things we come up with the touring machines the cellular automata whatever else is it true for our actual physical world is it true for the brain brains which are an element of the physical world we don't know for sure and that's not the type of question that we will have a definitive answer to because it's you know it's a there's a sort of scientific induction issue you can say what's true for all these brains but this person over here is really special and it's not true for them and you can't you know the the only way that that cannot be what happens is if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics and it turns out to correspond to let's say a simple program if that is the case then we will basically have reduced physics to a branch of mathematics in the sense that we will not be you know right now with physics we're like well this is the theory that you know this is the rules that apply here but in the middle of that you know right by that black hole maybe these rules don't apply and something else applies and there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel back but as if if we can get to the point where we actually have this is the fundamental theory of physics here it is it's this program run this program and you will get our universe then we've kind of reduced the problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of doing some what turns out to be very difficult irreducibly difficult mathematical problems but it no longer is the case that we can say that somebody can come and say whoops you know you will write about all these things about turning machines but you're wrong about the physical universe we know there's sort of ground truth about what's happening in the physical universe now I happen to think I mean you asked me at an interesting time because I'm just in the middle of starting to to re energize my my project to kind of study fundamental theory of physics as of today I'm very optimistic that we're actually going to find something and that it's going to be possible to to see that the universe really is computational in that sense but I don't know because we're betting against you know we're betting against the universe so to speak and I didn't you know it's not like you know when I spend a lot of my life building technology and then I know what what's in there right and it's that maybe it may have unexpected behavior it may have bugs things like that but fundamentally I know what's in there for the universe I'm not in that position so to speak what kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from just to clarify so there's you've done a lot of fascinating work with kind of discrete kinds of computation that you know because cellular automata and we'll talk about it have this very clean structure such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules can create immense complexity but what kind you know is that actually our cellular automata sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might create the laws of physics just to give can you give us a sense of what kind of computation do you think would create well so so this is a slightly complicated issue because as soon as you have universal computation you can imprincible simulate anything with anything but it is not a natural thing to do and if you're asking were you to try to find our physical universe by looking at possible programs and the computational universe of all possible programs would the ones that correspond to our universe be small and simple enough that we might find them by searching that computational universe we got to have the right basis so to speak we have we'll have the right language in effect for describing computation for that to be feasible so the thing that I've been interested in for a long time is what are the most structural structures that we can create with computation so in other words if you say a cellular automaton it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid and it's very you know and every cell is updated in synchrony at this at a particular you know when there's a click of a clock so to speak and it goes a tick of a clock and every cell gets updated at the same time that's a very specific very rigid kind of thing but my guess is that when we look at physics and we look at things like space and time that what's underneath space and time is something as structural as possible that what we see what emerges for us as physical space for example comes from something that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath and so I've been for a long time interested in kind of what what are the most structural structures that we can set up and actually what I had thought about for ages is using graphs networks were essentially so let's talk about space for example so what is space is a kind of a question one might ask back in the early days of quantum mechanics for example people said oh for sure space is going to be discrete because all these other things we're finding are discrete but that never worked out in physics and so space and physics today is always treated as this continuous thing just like Euclid imagined it I mean the the very first thing Euclid says in his sort of common notions is you know a point is something which has no part in other words there are there are points that are arbitrarily small and there's a continuum of possible positions of points and the question is is that true and so for example if we look at I don't know fluid like air or water we might say it's a continuous fluid we can pour it we can do all kinds of things continuously but actually we know because we know the physics of it that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecules bouncing around and only in the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum and so the possibility exists that that's true of space people haven't managed to make that work with existing frameworks and physics but I've been interested in whether one can imagine that underneath space and also underneath time is something more structuralist and the question is is it computational so there are a couple possibilities it could be computational somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine or it could be fundamentally not so how could it not be it could not be so a Turing machine essentially deals with integers whole numbers it's unlevel and you know it can do things like it can add one to a number it can do things like this it can also store whatever the heck it did yes it can has an infinite storage storage but what when one thinks about doing physics or sort of idealized physics or idealized mathematics one can deal with real numbers numbers with an infinite number of digits numbers which are absolutely precise someone can say we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself are you comfortable with infinity in this context are you comfortable in the context of computation do you think infinity plays a part I think that the role infinity is complicated infinity is useful in conceptualizing things it's not actualizable almost by definition it's not actualizable but do you think infinity is part of the thing that might underlie the laws of physics I think that no I think there are many questions that you ask about you might ask about physics which inevitably involve infinity like when you say you know is faster than light travel possible you could say with with with given the laws of physics can you make something even arbitrarily large even quotes infinitely large that you know that will make faster than light travel possible then you you're throwing into dealing with infinity as a as a kind of theoretical question but I mean talking about you know sort of what's underneath space and time and what how one can make you know a computational infrastructure one possibility is that you can't make a computational infrastructure during such a machine sense that you really have to be dealing with precise real numbers you're dealing with partial differential equations which just have precise real numbers that arbitrarily closely separated points you have a continuum for everything could be that that's what happens that there's sort of a continuum for everything and precise real numbers for everything and then the things I'm thinking about are wrong and you know that's that's the risk you take if you're you know if you're trying to sort of do things about nature is you might just be wrong it's not it's for me personally it's kind of a strange thing because I've spent a lot of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody cares about but you can't be sort of wrong in that sense and the sense you build your technology and it does what it does but but I think you know this question of what you know what the sort of underlying computational infrastructure for the universe might be yes it's so it's sort of inevitable it's going to be fairly abstract because if you're going to get all these things like there are three dimensions of space there are electrons there are muons there are quarks there are this you don't get to if the if the model for the universe is simple you don't get to have sort of a line of code for each of those things you don't get to have sort of the the the the the the muon case the towel laptop on case and so on all of those are all have to be emergent some right so something deeper right so so that means it's sort of inevitable that's a little hard to talk about what the sort of underlying structuralist structure actually is do you think our human beings have the cognitive capacity to understand if we're to discover to understand the kinds of simple structure from which these laws can emerge like do you think that's a good question suit well here's what I think I think that I mean I'm right in the middle of this right now right so I'm telling you that I this human yeah I mean this human has a hard time understanding you know a bunch of the things that are going on but but what happens in understanding is when builds waypoints I mean if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics starting from you know counting back in you know whenever counting was invented 50,000 years ago whatever it was right there's that would be really difficult but what happens is we build waypoints that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding and we see the same thing happening in language you know when we invent a word for something it provides kind of a cognitive anchor a kind of a waypoint that lets us you know like a podcast or something you could be explaining well it's a thing which this works this way that way they are the way but as soon as you have the word podcast and people kind of society understand it you start to be able to build on top of that and so I think and that that's kind of the story of science actually too I mean science is about building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism for understanding something let me can build on top of it you know we we have the idea of I don't know differential equations we can build on top of that we have this idea of that so my hope is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer and there's no waypoints in between then we're toast we won't be
