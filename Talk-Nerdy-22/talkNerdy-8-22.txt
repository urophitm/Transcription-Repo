Hello everyone and welcome to talk nerdy today is Monday December 9th 2019 and I'm the host of the show Kara Santa Maria time traveling again this week and by my calculations I am just on an airplane Coming home from Melbourne from what I have to assume was an incredible trip with the skeptics guide to the universe Yeah, but I'm actually recording this a couple of weeks in advance so that I don't have to bring my recording equipment with me halfway across the world Guys, I'm super excited about this week's show we get to talk to Dr. Darcy Lockeman all about her newest book But before we dive into that I want to thank those of you who continue to make talk nerdy possible each and every week to help me so that I can offer this service for free to anybody who wants to listen So those of you who have pledged your support on patreon. I thank you so much Anybody who's interested maybe I don't know as a holiday gift To a loved one maybe in their name or just as a gift to everybody listening you can visit patreon.com slash talk nerdy and learn all about how to support the show this week's top patrons include Sinai, Ulrica Hagman, Pedro Emrozario Barbosa, Dudos infinitas, Phil Tiber, the zombie drummer, David J.E. Smith, Brian Holden, and Jeffrey Suol and one of the things that's interesting about that list and also interesting every time I do surveys on the show is that the vast majority of those names were men's names Ulrica thank you so much And also I don't know I don't know if Sinai is I don't know what gender Sinai is could be Could be many things, but I do really really appreciate All of the supporters and all of the listeners of the show one thing that I've struggled with from the beginning of talk nerdy I think partially because it's a it's a science show and also partially because podcasting itself has some gender inequities in it But the vast majority of my listenership is male and I think that this is going to be an eye-opening Episode and interview for many of my listeners. Hopefully my my female listeners really feel heard Hopefully my male listeners Learned something new and of course any of my Non- you know non-binary or trans listeners Don't feel left out of the conversation. I think that this is a really really important one for everybody to hear because it helps us Understand some of the issues that a lot of people are facing In their marriages today. So Dr. Darcy Lockman. She's actually a clinical psychologist who who worked as a journalist and now she writes books I mean she still works as a clinical psychologist But um, I think a lot of her journalism expertise fed into this this book her newest book because she interviewed a lot of people And really got down to the heart of some of the issues that they deal with so the book is called all the rage mothers Fathers and the myth of equal partnership. Yes, I said rage. Yes. I said myth We're gonna dive into all of that right now. So without any further ado Here she is Dr. Darcy Lockman Darcy, thank you so much for joining me today. Hi, Cara. Thank you for having me Of course, I'm really looking forward to this chat um, you know at first blush I think it looks like your book is kind of a different fit for my show since it's mostly a science show lately I've been doing more psychology and social science topics And this is much more of a I would say a social justice topic written though by a clinical psychologist and so How much I mean how much of your book comes from you and how much of it comes from your work Oh gosh, well, I would say like almost none of it comes from my work as a therapist I mean the the conception of a book was all about my personal experience and kind of coming up against frustration around like just kind of taking care of everything at home without my husband I'm meaning for it to be that way and there was a lot of conflict between us about this when our kids were young and I also saw all the women I knew kind of living this way too and feeling really frustrated And so the journalist in me got because I was a journalist before I went back to school to be a psychologist The journalist in me got really like worked up like what like I had this question that I really wanted to answer So I started digging into all the social science research around it So it's funny because I want I said to my editor Before the book came out. I'm like do we have to even mention that I'm a clinical psychologist Because I don't want people to get the wrong idea about the book and she was like no I know it gives you a little more gravitas. So we're gonna we're gonna say the ureth clinical psychologist I was like all right fine And it's not that I'm not proud of my profession It's just that I feel like this is not a clinical psychologist book Yeah, but the good news is that between your kind of experience as a journalist and then the skills that you develop as a psychologist you actually do You're kind of in a position where you can read the academic literature about this exactly. Yes That was the one helpful part. I knew how to read research because I had a PhD have a PhD So I think without without that training and the degree it would have been really hard to read all this stuff Like I know what I can skip when I'm reading somebody's academic paper because this I know this I can like look at the paper and understand it with and I can skip the stats And just not read that section And still like understand that I can get the gist of the article So how long did you work as a journalist before you got into psychology? I love to kind of understand you know who authors are and what they're bringing to their to their writing even though You know you didn't kind of approach this book as a psychologist's book So I became a journalist in 1988 when I was in my junior year of high school Which is but I'm kidding but I was on my high school newspaper and then I was editor in chief of my high school newspaper and then I went to the University of Michigan and worked on the Michigan daily which is like a really good college paper so I um I actually started learning to do that sort of thing pretty young and I always loved writing But I never wanted to be a fiction writer per se my brain didn't work that way So I really liked nonfiction and then during college as I was working at the college newspaper I got introduced to like Joan Didian and Hunter Thompson and Norman Mailer And like all that stuff the new journalism and I realized that nonfiction writing could be really fun and really colorful So I moved to New York City after college Which was 1994 And worked in magazine publishing for about 10 years And a lot of it I was on staff at different magazines But I was a freelance writer off and on um throughout that time And I started to feel like so much of being a freelance writer Was writing stuff that was not at all interesting to you just because you had to make a living And after a while I just thought you know, I don't think like I need something to sustain me for the next 50 years I don't think this is going to be it for me Um, and I had started seeing a therapist when I moved to New York and I just thought like the way she What she understood about human nature was so fascinating to me Um, I mean I got a lot out of therapy also in other ways But like it really intrigued me so at the same time as I was thinking um This magazine writing thing is just not I don't I don't know if I can take it far enough to be doing interesting pieces all the time Um, so I decided you know Having developed this other interest to go back to school for that But also thinking like I would eventually be a therapist who also wrote So um, it's really nice that I've been able to do that Yeah, that's I mean It is one of those kinds of careers and it's something that I've thought about quite a bit like as as a freelancer It sort of allows you to continue to have the freelance lifestyle Um, which is so kind of deeply important to me. Oh, yeah I love being self-employed. It's been especially as a parent I think such a nice thing to be able to kind of structure my own schedule And then also when I'm writing books, I can kind of condense my therapy practice a little bit So that I'm home writing part time and I'm in the office seeing patients part time It's a really nice mix of of things professionally for me And so you know, this book is about Rearing parents really it's about partnership um, but but parents who rear children and what that um Experiences like and and who who carries the weight um, but you also said that your clinical practice does not feed into this book What is your specific focus in clinical practice? You're not a couples therapist. I am actually a couples therapist I see adult I see adults so I work with adults and couples But this is not typically the main issue that brings couples to treatment I mean whenever I'm seeing a couple with kids and especially young kids This is certainly part of the conversation But it's not like typically the focus so while of course You know is veteran owned and operated the bearded Viking meat crews reinventing the ancient art of meat making with a modern twist They're award-winning needs are handcrafted with high quality ingredients offering a rich variety of flavors that range from bold and fruity to smooth and traditional Whether you're sitting there classic OG or enjoying creative blends like choke cherry vanilla or jalapeno raspberry There's something for every palate with a commitment to quality and flavor the bearded Viking meat company focuses on creating good times for a great meetup To bring family and friends together So visit beardedviking.com today to explore their collection and get ready for your next meetup The best way to buy a car is the Werner way you'll find more value every day at Werner Hyundai That's more style more comfort and more warranty test drive the 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe with an all-new epic style and comfort Every Hyundai comes with owner assurance and America's best warranty a 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain limited warranty That protects you not just locally, but nationwide enjoy five years of complimentary maintenance three from the factory plus two more from Werner Werner Hyundai dot com interesting because as I've gotten older my patients have gotten older So I'm now in the last like five years Let's say much more likely to be seeing people who have kids when I started my practice when I was 35 Because you know I went back to school at 30 Most of my patients were in their 20s and so a lot of them didn't have kids as I got older and my patients The people who came to see me started getting older I would certainly hear from women that they were resentful and felt overloaded and I would hear from men My wife is angry at me all the time and I do not understand why So as I as I saw more parents this was certainly you know part of the conversation But again never the focus So when I say my practice didn't like feed into the book It was more of the experience I was having as a mother and you know spending time with other women who Who were also you know professionals or working And frustrated with their male partners that was more that was much more the Impetus for the book and when throughout that process did you first have kids Like where were you in your career? So my husband and I met in grad school. We were in the same class and So we you know we were together throughout school And then we got married at the tail end of our internship year So in the fifth year of school And we started our we both started our practices um While having like other part-time jobs that had more like reliable income in the beginning And then we had kids You know, I was 35 when we got married So we had our first daughter like pretty you know pretty soon thereafter So I was 36 when we had our first daughter And I was about actually I wasn't licensed until after she was born So I was doing my postdoc hours when I was pregnant and around the time she was born So it wasn't really until I mean even though we had some conflicts when we only had one kid It wasn't until the second came along that I really was so overwhelmed and angry So it was sort of like I guess when our oldest was four and our youngest was one that this question really started to coalesce for me And then I didn't decide to write the book until I think our youngest was three when I started working Um, so I was yeah, I was like in the family stuff in the practice stuff And I had I wrote a book about my clinical internship So I had written a book Called Brooklyn Zoo that was published my random house in 2012 So I kind of was our you know, I was trying to think of new book ideas And this question became persistent at the same time that I was like what you know, what am I gonna write next And so was Kind of the act of writing cathartic for you I think a lot of people think that when people write about an experience, you know Something more autobiographical or more memoir-esque that like all that shit is done with I'm reflecting back on the past and these are my insights But like you were in it while you were writing it Yeah, I mean because our kids were getting older and because I was working on this book It was something I mean first of all as your kids get older and I hear this from people Things get a little easier like initially when they're completely dependent It's so draining especially when there's more than one and then as they establish a little more independence They can get themselves a glass of water. They can dress themselves The weight comes off a little bit and things got easier and I was when I were in couples therapy so that helped really helped a lot um Oh my god, I lost sight of even more question you asked me I was in the thick of it while writing and reading all the research because the book is not a memoir I mean my like my personal story is the jumping off point and I interviewed 50 mothers for the book and so my stories as well as there's are in there But it's also really research heavy um, so I you know, I was reading all this stuff about why women are so oppressed in our society And listening to or hearing people's ideas about why that is so and why that hasn't shifted more So it was like reading the research was kind of enraging. I would find myself getting angry There's this idea that Roxanne Gay who's uh the the feminist writer essayist novelist writer extraordinaire talks about um she calls it writing toward answers Like not really knowing what a solution is but writing toward answers and I really liked that idea I kind of let that guide me as as I worked on the book because it wasn't like we were ever really figuring it out But I was like writing toward answers in understanding the the lemma more um precisely and fully Yeah, I mean ultimately writing about some sort of kind of systemic societal issue Is not going to Solve the systemic societal issue it's gonna bring eyes to it and that's the most important thing It's you know going to help people realize that maybe the status quo is only good for the people who like still have the power Yeah, right. I mean, you know the word myth is in the title in the subtitle and the reason that is so is that there's this idea in culture now about the modern involved father And you know, it's this idea that men are so much more involved as fathers than they were in like you know The word cleaver leap to be for a kind of generation and that's not untrue all the research supports that But this story this myth that we know about leaves a big chunk out which is the the labor part the unpaid labor stuff and women are still largely responsible for that They do Women in dual earner couples do 65% of the child care Having a wife creates seven or I'm sorry being a wife Create seven extra hours of work a week for a woman while becoming a husband lessons a man's workload at home by about an hour a week So there's so much quantitative data that supports the fact that unpaid labor is still largely done by women And we can look at it in this glass half full way which is father's out now more involved with their kids Which is wonderful for everybody But that is the glass half full way of looking at it and again leaves out the labor piece So it was my thought, you know, and this is this is kind of the premise of my work as a therapist too That making the unconscious conscious can help us to at least at least make choices instead of letting things kind of defile To the gendered way they go when we don't know what is likely to happen Because of what is Yeah, I mean it it feels a little bit like sometimes when there's a bit of a social movement for change If there's some incremental change and people report on that incremental change or people become more aware of that incremental change That it becomes inflated in the consciousness of most of the people in a society like oh well everything fine now the pendulum swung and it's like No, we're not there yet, but in this case it's not only in it It's not quite that it's inflated. It's that it's conflated So like there's no distinction made between being like an involved father and being a good partner And they're really two very different things Gotcha, so this is something I'm so excited to talk about it because it's something I care deeply about but having no personal experience What so ever and I think there's a part of me that's always wondered or I mean I think I could probably Tell somebody if they asked to but it might take a while for me to formulate my answers That I just have no interest in getting married and never have and I've had incredible partners and I've had You know wonderful really fulfilling relationships But when it comes time to have that conversation like oh, yeah, that's like not when I'm in this for um And luckily for me, I think it's easier sometimes to have a male partner um When when I say I don't want to ever get married for them to be like oh, okay as opposed to it might it might be different right if I had a female partner I don't know I don't know if there are gender differences there, but um But I also have no interest in having kids and I really understand why people who want to have a family and want to have children Also desire the security of having a an institution of having a marriage because it's protective Yeah, absolutely It's protective and it you know, it makes you part of something larger in a way You know, it's like we have religious traditions And a lot of people myself included who enjoy religious traditions don't really feel religious It's just nice to be doing things that our ancestors did I think as humans It makes us feel connected to like the past and maybe the future So I wonder if marriage is is like it you know in a way it's something like that It's a way of being connect feeling connected to something Yeah, I mean and then but with that comes this kind of dark underbelly of the fact that when you look at the past and you look at traditions And you look at where marriage really Ultimately started it was a contract It was about you know in many ways ownership in in many ways I mean it's really dark. Oh, yeah, I mean women went from being owned to by their fathers to being owned by their husbands That's exactly what marriage was and in fact That's the derivation of Mrs. versus Miss Miss is a signifier that you belonged to your father Mrs. is a signifier that you belong to the mister. I mean it is mr. apostrophe s is Mrs. right?

Oh my god. Yeah, that's one explanation for the for the derivation of the term I mean it does distinguish whose property or it did once distinguish whose property a female was Wow, and I mean that's I've always been like weird about rings too because I feel like that's like some sort of weird symbol of like ownership or like I'm his I'm betrothed I'm you know, it's like a lot of it kind of puts a bad taste in my mouth that There are these things that I think a lot of people view as these very positive symbols of choice But but they don't have very savory histories and I think sometimes what ends up happening with an unsavory past is that you know the fundamental um Aspects of that sort of wiggle their way into modern society still yeah the home has been called a gender factory And I think that you know people when people talk about gender there's there's a way of talking about it being part of a social relational Construct meaning we're never so much women or men as when we're in the company of the opposite gender and then we define ourselves by who we are like in polarity in Right contrast against the other so when you have a woman and a man living together even if they are progressive and don't Subscribe to a lot of traditional values that stuff does start to come out and if you read the women studies literature or the family studies research or any of it There is a consistent finding about couples becoming more traditional first to maybe at the hand marriage, but then certainly when children enter the home Even if again they they espouse progressive values Attitudes it turns out do not predict behavior Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm kind of not surprised by that. I mean even in my own life I had a long-term relationship that was very progressive um, and you know no no marriage no children but lived in a beautiful home together own to home together and he made significantly more money than I did and I think that even those kinds of inequities in the home start to espouse or foster roles that are Different and not just not just in terms of behavior, but also in terms of How would I put it Emotional responses, uh, you know, it's it's interesting that you bring up money because obviously men have traditionally out-earned women And when that was almost always the case there was a theory called relative resource theory In the family studies literature that espoused that women did more unpaid labor at home because they brought in less money So but once women actually were did start out earning their husbands and right now at this point in history according to the census bureau 38% of married women out earn their male partners So now we're at a point where 38% yeah, um, but guess what uh relative resource theory was disproven because even when women out earn their male partners They still do more of the unpaid labor of the home both with children and without children So it can feel like oh he earns more money. That's why I'm doing more at home But really it was just like the gender structure and the money was just kind of like a You know A curtain over it that made it look like well makes sense, you know he earns more so I should do more at home people people could like kind of justify it But interestingly women who earn more so the other thing the census bureau has found by comparing self-reported Income to IRS reported income women who out earn their husbands Um downplay how much they earn when they're reporting it So something goes on where like women feel like they should neutralize the gender deviance as it's called gender deviance neutralization Like I'm gonna say I earn less because it's really uncomfortable that I earn more than my spouse And the men will under report their wives it comes to again not illegal. They're not they're not under reporting the IRS It's when the census bureau asks Wow, I mean, I mean, I'm not surprised It's it's it's such a deep kind of thing it cuts so deep in our consciousness and I mean like it's this Relational thing like you said kind of comparing ourselves to our partners for example But at the same time I think it's also a societal systemic thing where like women don't have like as strong Negotiation skills when they are you know trying to get a raise they tend to Like feel uncomfortable talking about money with their Friends or their colleagues and almost feel shameful if you make money like oh, it's like oh, I don't want to tell people about that Yeah, so there was this really disturbing study at an an Ivy League MBA program and they asked um single women partnered women and men about their ambitions and and they out like professional ambitions and that some of the Some of the students were told the the whatever they said would remain private Some of the students in the study were told that you know the information collected by this study would be Public everyone would see what they said and the answers were consistent for the partnered women and the men in the study no matter if it was going to be public or private But the single women in the study when told that their answers would be public Downplayed their professional ambitions and these single women also participated less in classroom discussions So even though there are grades at the end of the semester were just as high as their as their peers There was there's they seem to be downplaying Both their intelligence and what they wanted professionally the single women were and the researchers speculated this was because they didn't want to become less desirable partners Not that they were trying to hook up with anyone in the program, but just like in general they They thought they must have had it in their heads that they had to act like they weren't super ambitious They were just getting their MBAs and that might you know that could be nice and well and good and fun But maybe they'd just like have families Oh god It's like a weird grown-up version of stereotype threat, but like on its ear it's like so strange and I mean I I don't I get it because even though usually we talk about the stuff like you said before Making the unconscious conscious you know a lot of this stuff is happening sort of below the surface Maybe we're not consciously thinking about it But I wonder how many women listening to this right now or men maybe even reflecting and listening to this right now Can think back to an experience where it's like yep, that's exactly why you know I said this or I did this in that situation. I dated a very successful um scientist and I myself was very successful in my career at the time and working a lot and I remember when we broke up and You know we cared about each other things weren't working some of the discussions around the breakup were very clearly um I did not expect to Find myself in a position with someone like you Unfortunately, I'm very very attracted to your ambition and it's probably a big part of why I like you like how hard you work and how ambitious you are and how Successfully you are But my goal is to actually marry somebody who will stay home and take care of my children and that's not actually said this to you Oh, he was very clear about it. Oh my god He was very clear that you know I'm from a small town. This is the lifestyle that I want and I It's the thing that makes me most attracted to you is the thing that makes it so that we really don't have a future Wow, it was like wow amazing. I mean at least you're being honest. Yeah So there was a speed dating study at Columbia and you know, you know, speed dating is right you go on a series of very like I don't know five minute dates with a bunch of people who've also signed up for speed dating And then at the end of the speed dating round after you've had like these like 10 dates you kind of um you say whether you want to see the person again or not Um, it's like a pretty common social thing this speed dating But Columbia was doing this study so they arranged it just like any other speed dating and then they asked people to fill out questionnaires afterwards Rating different qualities of the person they had been on a date with so like rating the other persons intelligence and ambition And you know a bunch of other qualities which I don't remember and then they had to rate their own ambition and intelligence and all this stuff And what they found when they compared what the men you know who the men wanted to go out with again versus who the women wanted to go out with again Because it was all heterosexual speed dating um they found that like Men didn't want dates with women. They found more intelligent or ambitious than themselves and the women you know the women did I'm getting I'm like bastardizing this study. It's in my book and you can find it online if you want I'm sure um But it was just you know it like tells us what we already know right? It's exactly what this guy was saying to you like I like your ambition But you're you're too ambitious for me and I think women um are used to making themselves small I mean, I remember not wanting to like sound too smart in high school because I didn't think the boys would like me um And it makes me want to send my kids to an all-girl school like I hope those are veteran-owned and operated the bearded Viking meat crew is reinventing the ancient art of meat making with a modern twist They're award-winning needs are handcrafted with high-quality ingredients offering a rich variety of flavors that range from bold and fruity to smooth and traditional Whether you're sitting there classic OG or enjoying creative blends like choked cherry vanilla or jalapeno raspberry There's something for every palate with a commitment to quality and flavor the bearded Viking meat company focuses on creating good times for a great Meetup to bring family and friends together So visit beardedviking.com today to explore their collection and get ready for your next meetup Step into the world of power Loyalty and luck.

Why do they need that extra umph that extra nudge? It's because in the classroom when Assigned a math problem a girl is more likely to say out loud This is too hard. I don't understand it whereas a boy is more likely to be like no, it's not I get it And that's socialization That's being taught how you're allowed to say your emotions how you're allowed to show your frustration tolerance to To verbalize if you're if you're sad about something not making sense whereas boys It's more I think in many ways the problem of how we raise our boys to not show emotion to act tough it out act like they get it Act strong even in the face of adversity Even if what they really want to do is cry or say I need help We don't let them do that and so then you know Girls end up seeing that kind of behavior and going well, I guess it's easy for them And it's hard for me so I'm not cut out for this teacher expectation has such an impact too There've been some really good studies with this And so when you have teachers who probably believe that boys are better at math and science That's going to be their expectation of their students You know this plays out with race too when you have teachers who expect that the white kids are going to do better than the kids of color The expectation has an impact on the outcome So there's so many layers to this that you know when people say to me Well, how do we solve this problem of gender and equity in the home? It's like well, you know in preschool classrooms Girls are reinforced for babbling while boys are reinforced and when I say reinforced I mean given attention for boys are reinforced for aggressive behaviors teachers intervene to modulate boys aggressive behaviors Like three times as often as with girls Why is that so it's because they're worried about boys aggression But kids like attention so that feel you know, it's a it's a reinforcing behavior So like by the time kids are two and three boys are hitting and shoving more and girls are babbling and talking more because they've been more Re-enforced for that so it's like how do we solve gender and equity in in adult homes? I think the only way to do it is to become really conscious of our internalized sexism Because we're not going to make any shifts in this internalized sexism Given these like really subtle ways that gender different differences supposed to gender differences I mean they are socialized gender differences Are reinforced like all over the world in every minute of your children's lives And so as adults we have to be really conscious of our implicit beliefs if we want to create a different sort of life for ourselves Yeah, and I think it's important that you mention that too that these implicit beliefs they're not They're not specific to the opposite gender like women have implicit sexism towards girls men have implicit sexism towards forward Towards ourselves. I mean, I'm constantly one of the things that I was kind of really forced to contend with and writing this book is how Automatically I work to relieve my husband of any burdens he might have like I always think oh Just take that if he looks stressed or concerned and I heard this from so many women You know, you do something yourself and you think well This is my individual psychology that you hear it from enough people and you realize well. This is also Socialization right women girls are socialized to be communal to think about others boys are socialized But their needs and priorities first To have agency and ambition girls to think about others and be thoughtful and you know generally speaking So I really found myself with this internalized sexism. It's my job to make sure he's comfortable right it's like the old stereotype of like bringing your husband a drink after work as he kicks off his shoes um, and that that comes from a time when there were a class of mothers who were able to stay home I you know able to as if this was such a prize a lot of women were really unhappy as is quite well documented But that that impulse I see it in myself So when we talk about internalized sexism, it's not only in the way we treat our daughters But in the way we relate to ourselves and our own priorities and needs and um Uh ambition to value our first year. Yeah. I mean I have a a recurring experience in relationships And again, I'm saying this coming from a position where I am generally engaged and incredibly progressive relationships with amazing people I actually you know, maintain friendships with a lot of the people I feel like I have to copy out this because I'm like, oh if anybody knows And they're gonna be like, oh no, I've incredible people who again, we all fall victim to this stuff though And so one of the things yeah, it's like I'm not saying anything bad about my partners. They're amazing Patriarchy is a system not a person right exactly. Thank you for that. Yeah But one of the things that I found consistent across relationships when I'm in relationships with The opposite gender is that I am very attuned as you said to their needs I can tell when they're having a bad day. I can kind of preempt certain sorts of like blow-ups or arguments and I can sort of be sensitive when I need to be sensitive And I found that when I'm in a bad way I almost have to wear it on my sleeve intentionally just to get the kind of feedback or attention that I need at that moment Like I have to explicitly say I am sad today and I need you to be sensitive towards me Or even apologize. I'm sorry. I'm just really sensitive today Whereas I can preempt their sensitivities before they even real they're like no, I'm fine I'm like, I don't think you're fine like you're acting like you're not fine And then ultimately it comes out. No, this is what I'm dealing with at work like is that consistent across our society? I think so I mean It's interesting because one interpretation I read of that is because women have always had less power societally you know for 150,000 years since the advent of emotionally modern humans We've had to be more sensitive to the more powerful people around us So is this like an evolved trade? Is it a socialized trade? It's probably both You know, if you're the one who doesn't have any power you better be checking out everything that's going on you around you all the time to kind of be prepared um And then we're we are also girls are socialized and reinforced for being caring and considerate Attention to other people's needs and I you know have been I think the thing my husband was the first man I ever lived with other than my father actually had a male roommate Now that's that's interesting to know that I'm thinking about that But I would notice with my husband And you know, and it became more apparent as we had kids that his needs so often And you know my I'll do the same caveat and you're doing my husband's a great father my children adore him He's totally involved with them He my husband is also a therapist. He's a sensitive guy But I would just watch his needs come first Almost all the time you know, we would get home and the kids would be tired and he would he would have straight into our bathroom To brush his teeth and it was like I could not think about that like we got home with two tired kids And I was getting them in their pajamas and ready for bed um And it was just things like that all the time it was so disorienting To be sharing a home and a family with someone who like I could never think of putting my needs first And I don't mean to elevate myself and saying this because there's something pathological about this too But I think these are the gender roles right Are we the gender who thinks about our own needs first most of the time or the gender who does not So I think you know Neither position is sustainable But watching my husband live this way was so disorienting to me because I didn't realize And I think that's part of what male privileges and to see it up close was so weird And now that I'm thinking about my male roommate he used to um We both have dogs and he would stay at his girlfriend's house And not bothered to like call me and say can you walk the dog? He would just assume that I was gonna do it and like take care of it And he was a great roommate I love this roommate. We're still friends great guy. Here's my caveat again But when I'm thinking back and we had a really easy roommate relationship because Things are less intense somehow in male female friendships sometimes then With with women I had lived with so it was actually a great great roommate situation um But there were things like that that I would notice like I never would have just expected him to walk my dog if I didn't ask Hello, it is Ryan and we could all use an extra bright spot in our day Couldn't we just to make up for things like sitting in traffic doing the dishes counting your steps You know all the mundane stuff that is why I'm such a big fan of chamba casino Chamba casino has all your favorite social casino style games You can play for free anytime anywhere with daily bonuses.

That's chamba casino.com All right guys, let's get back to the show We have to count out these things because again This is a social structure and we feel like oh gosh if I don't caveat these things people are gonna think that I'm being aggressive or Exactly, I'm being such a bitch right. I know and I had this like massive experience during my last breakup where you know again Together for a very long time very supportive loving um really still care about each other deeply But you know one of those things where just our lives changed and we grew in different directions And I remember so when we broke up we owned a home together So it was a lot of work to like be bought out of the home by a new I bought myself a new home It was the first time I'd ever done that it was very empowering in a lot of ways But it was also incredibly stressful and hard for me and during the time he you know He bought me out of the house. So I got a lump sum. He came with me to go house hunting He would go to the store with me to buy all the odds and ends that I needed for my new place And when I would tell my friends about that they would be like he's so amazing You're so lucky blah blah and there was a moment where I was like Yes, don't get me wrong. He is amazing and I am lucky But like why is that our response? This is like What's expected I would do this? I don't think we need to elevate it like he's got some fucking crown on his head for it I appreciate it But why are we so congratulatory when a guy is just like a good guy right and a lot of the mothers that I interviewed for the book would talk about this Um and say like you know and you know or there's the observation has been made like Men get applauded for changing diapers and women do not get applauded for earning money like no one ever says Oh, that's great that you're earning most of the money in your home But oh my god, it's amazing that your ex-boyfriend is thoughtful enough about your needs to Help you look for a new home when he's getting your old one Yeah Right and then a lot of women I interviewed also would fall back on this idea of gratitude when they because when I um Solicited interview subjects for the book. I did it by saying I went on Facebook mothers message boards because I wanted a geographical Diversity and said hey, I'm working on this book If you've had issues with this in your own relationship, I'd love to talk to you. So everyone I Recruited was was in the situation where they were frustrated And so they would talk to me very colorfully and with a lot of energy about their frustrations And then a lot of times they would walk it back and say oh, but but I'm really very lucky He does so much more than other men So this kind of position of gratitude works to Disappear the anger that they were feeling So I wonder if in a patriarchy Women because of the anger they typically feel and can't like necessarily know about very easily Get to this. Oh, you're so lucky, right? Like instead of just like yeah men Aren't usually that considerate and doesn't that suck and what are we gonna do about it? And how can we all work together to change that instead you hear oh, you're so lucky, right? Yeah, because the goal posts are so shifted that Yeah, and then that's like that's like having salt in the wound It's like you know people who struggle with depression I myself and one of them I work with a lot of patients who struggle with depression As I'm sure you do as well one of the hardest things about depression is that you're sad And then you feel guilty on top of being sad for being sad and for it affecting your behavior negatively And the guilt and the shame on top of the the underlying layer of of sadness and depression makes it like significantly worse and so I think this is the There's a parallel there with women who maybe were upset about something But then we're told constantly how lucky we are that it makes us feel like we're not allowed to be upset about it When we have you know decent partner I interviewed women whose husbands said to them Well, I do a lot more than other men when they tried to raise the issue as if that were an acceptable answer But we live in systems that tell us that it is and then we swallow our anger and feel guilty You know women would say to me. Oh, I feel guilty talking about this As if like expressing themselves and really just living with the reality of what it means To kind of exist in a sexist society Was not it wasn't okay to acknowledge you know, we have to act as if that it weren't the case Yeah, oh yeah, like as if the thing that's being unspoken is not even understood that like yeah, that's why we are together Like I would not be with you if you were like abusing me, you know like I love you We're talking about the issues beyond that right if so if you're with someone and they have Feelings about something. It's part of your job as a partner to hear them out But what I heard from people and experienced in my own marriage was that this was such a It was such a difficult topic Because men felt accused and bad And women felt unheard because when someone's feeling accused and bad they're likely to be defensive and not open And actually one of the nice things I've heard from couples who have read my book together Is that the book really allowed them to see that it wasn't their fault like it wasn't her fault It wasn't his fault that Outside forces had conspired to like put us in this situation And if we want things to be different how are we going to come together as a team to really do something about it? So it was really nice to hear that having all this information Helps them really just Think about ways to kind of proactively fix it and you know By absolving them of responsibility for it in some ways Yeah, you know, I'm wondering based on all of the research that you've done and all the people that you've talked to How hopeful you really are and I not not to like bring like a dark cast on this But I I asked that with with a short kind of anecdote about A dear friend of mine who recently got married and They became pregnant they had a child they she became pregnant I'm a little closer to the the husband, but they had a child and they decided That they wanted to raise this child in like a somewhat gender neutral way They didn't want to be precious about it, but they were like we're not going to tell you the gender We're not going to gender the child if we can help it, you know Some days they dress it very girly some days they dress it very boyish they call it it because it's still a baby Sometimes they call her she sometimes they call him he and they always say We're not trying to be weird about it if you want to know the biological sex like Change a diaper and you'll know like you're welcome to that, you know, you want to help out come change a diaper But ultimately we just really don't want everybody around us to gender our child because of how We Dress them or treat them until they're old enough to start making those kinds of decisions And I don't think for them it's about oh, we we're trying to induce having a trans baby I think for them it's like no, no, we just want this kid to have every opportunity And we don't want any of the stereotyping that happens at a young age to affect them negatively in their development But I think the funny thing is and the reason I bring this up is because the Response to this even from my friends some of my friends who are incredibly progressive and educated and living in LA and blah blah It's like an eye roll. It's like an oh my god. What are they doing like oh, they're so They're so forward thinking and and like they almost laugh at it as if it's some sort of like ludicrous idea That these parents who I think are trying to do something really good for their kid in a society that's very sick in this way People literally shame them. Wow. Yeah, we're so judgmental Um, I guess it's easy to be judgmental There's a book that I read In doing my research called an unconventional family by a psychologist who's um who's not alive anymore Her name is Sandra Bam name was Sandra Bam and she and her husband decided to raise their kids in the 70s and really gender neutral ways And they didn't call their kids it. I don't think when they were babies and like they but they they just tried to have this gender free Household because they didn't like The word sexism wasn't around yet In fact, they called it sexual racism because there wasn't a word for sexism. This was in the 70s The 60 70s 70s um Yeah, so The what they found was that the sort of gender ideas of the world were so like so permeated Their environment outside of their home that of course their children were still impacted So when you ask me about my optimism Um, I do think that you know, I've gotten such a great response to this book and part of the great response Have been for has been from men who sent me emails saying I always knew this was true I didn't have a way to articulate it Thank you for giving this to me because I really want to do better So I get emails like that and there is some hope But I feel like no matter what we do in our homes the world around us um is so it like Our ideas about gender are so baked in that I think it's really hard I think again the best bet is for couples to decide to live really consciously About um what we believe and I don't mean like our on top beliefs as some sociologists have called them But like the underneath beliefs the more implicit ones that we don't articulate how those are gonna affect us So I think you know the reason that I wrote this book was I feel like if we can become more conscious of this stuff We can make different choices So I really wrote the book that I felt would have been quite helpful for me to have when I embarked on parenthood and my husband So we could make more conscious choices about this stuff I'm so it wouldn't have been something that um that Colored in a kind of negative way the earliest years of our kids lives Which are really always going to be incredibly hard as well as incredibly joyful But we could have gotten along a lot better for a number of years If we had been really aware of what was going to go down So I hope that you know if enough people read this that you know some people are relieved of this way of living And we can you know make different choices again the more we know I think the better off we are So I would love to know like what some of those choices might be and some of the topics that you really did dig into in the book You know we mentioned um pay gaps we mentioned um like sort of quote-unquote domestic duties um just general child Rearing or child care duties, but what are some of the specific things that really do fundamentally differ in traditional or even quite progressive and modern homes where there is one man and one woman and sorry to also interject did you only really focus on heterosexual couples where both parents are still in the home Yes, so because the book is about sexism in romantic relationships I necessarily focused on heterosexual couples I did also interview some gay couples just to have like a sense of comparison But that wasn't the book of what I was doing So yes, I was looking at dual career couples Who who remained together while child rear dual career heterosexual couples who are together Yeah, that's that was like the the thrust of it because that was what you know That was kind of what I was trying to solve for like why is this every time I ask you a question I have like ten more questions hold that thought hold the thought about what some of the differences are because I do want to dive into that When you compared like it just as your means for comparison. Did you see big differences between gay couples? You know, I would hate to make broad pronouncements based on a handful of interviews with gay couples There's a little bit of research There is some research that suggests that of all gendered configurations of couples Lesbian's co-parent most harmoniously That finding really stayed with me For one thing is there is not a ton of research on gay couples and child rearing and division of labor But second because it made a kind of intuitive sense and I'll explain to you what I mean One of the lesbian couples that I interviewed said to me one of the women in this couple said to me you know I I give a lot of thought to what my partner has had on her plate in any given day or week And I know she's been picking up a lot of slack with the kids I will come home and make dinner and clear it up like I'm always in my mind balancing out our labor um, and then one of the gay men that I interviewed said to me We have the same problems as heterosexual couples, you know in terms of mutuality and really thinking about each other And it was so interesting doing these two interviews kind of back-to-back because the woman was saying to me You know my partner and I think about each other and what's been going on and we try to balance the scales And this man saying to me, you know, we kind of have trouble thinking about each other and I thought That's it right there, right Um and in heterosexual couples what I heard from a lot of people um And and I know I do this like I think about what's been going on and like if I'm away for the weekend On the rare occasion that that happens I come home and I take over because I feel like I have to balance out the scales Because my husband has had all this on him for like two days straight um, and I don't I heard from a lot of women that they think of that way and that their partners didn't necessarily um succeed in Acting as if they were in you know thinking that way and then behaving in that way So I think when we think about gender and the way boys are raised versus the way girls are raised It makes sense then that lesbians would cope here and most harmoniously Yeah, and almost that that anecdotal kind of um interview that you got from the the lesbian couple and the gay couple Really, I think puts on the platter kind of this issue of privilege of male privilege that we've been talking about and not I'm not saying that to denigrate. It's just it's it's true like that they almost yeah really um exemplify I'd what privilege is right there Yeah, it's not needing to think about the other and it's what you were talking about when you said you know You were really attuned to your partners mood and that you had to and you know There's nothing wrong with needing to communicate verbally like we need to do that as human beings um, but he your partner was less attuned to you and wasn't wasn't thinking about you as much you had to ask for it more And again, I think I think there are you know these differences and how we're raised and not in biology um Really, that's where they leave us and heterosexual relationships Okay, so other quick question before we get into the other meat um Because you're interviewing mostly heterosexual couples uh that have both have careers and that co-parent and live together and are married um, did how many people did you really talk to that have older children? I mean like That's rare right that people just stay married. Oh, no, I don't think it's rare I think we'll look through this absolutely. This is so I think one study that said Division of labor was the third cited reason for divorce after adultery and growing apart So I you know, I definitely heard from women who I got emails from women who said this is why I got divorced Um, and I'm so glad I did it because my life is so much easier now even though I'm a single parent at least I'm not mad at somebody else for not doing anything even though I have to everything now myself um, but yeah, no, I did I talked to people with teenagers for sure Hello, it is Ryan and I was on a flight the other day playing one of my favorite social spin slot games on chamba casino.com I looked over the person sitting next to me.

It's chamba casino.com and live the chamba life I you know, I made it my business to talk to people with kids still kids in the home But all along the age the age spectrum and the people with teenagers were more mad about like Historically what had gone down than what was happening in the present So now that the kids were like pretty independent Um, that it was more like the memory of the anger and how it impacted them Then like a lot of active anger about what was going on now Though again, it's just because there are less needs to be met not because there was some more egalitarian Way that had been achieved. It was just like well, we don't do that stuff anymore So so there's less on my plate. I'm still the one making dinner all the time if I want the family to have healthy food out your things like that Makes sense So so that right there is a good example of the original question That I wanted to dive into which is like the kind of stuff that Maybe people reading the book we hope will gain an awareness of you know because it's I think it's a it's a puzzle It's a lot of things together that have a gestalt to them which is just like being more aware But you have to start with the pieces of the puzzle before you start to see the image and so is it things like you know cooking or Is it things like trying to Understand somebody's needs before they have to verbalize them like what are the kinds of things that women generally said that they were like really resentful about well certainly it's the Being the kind of default parents so when there's anything that isn't explicitly discussed and divided The implicit assumption is that the mother is going to take care of it you know mothers are there to be imposed on And father's not so much so the default Parenting position is something that a lot of women had a hard time with the mental load the mental labor as it's been called It's another thing like knowing who needs to go to the doctor when knowing When the shoes are getting too small knowing That the class party is coming up and that xyz has to be brought in My daughter needs a tutor right now my younger ones having trouble in math like I know like my husband Like I was struggling to do it my husband was like do you want me to take over and I was like yeah And I forwarded in the list and like I know he hasn't made the call So it's like still on my mind that I have to remind him right so it's not just the doing of the stuff Which is an issue but it's also the thinking and the planning and it was interesting to read the sociologist who had done home studies For example, oh shoot her name is escaping me She wrote a netlora she wrote a book called race class and family life I think it was and she wasn't Writing about gender, but I interviewed her and she told me that like the gender division of labor was something that stood out to her so much as she was doing like this study Which was really a family's and race and class privilege She ended up writing a separate paper called My wife can tell you who I know Because she found in interviewing fathers that they knew like so little about their kids lives and it really stunned her And she would go into homes Where they said to her oh yeah dad does all the sports But then she would be there on a date that a soccer game was rained out and the mother was fielding all the phone calls Um and making sure the uniforms were ready and the snacks were ready But she said you know these people were so blinded by their ideology They're progressive ideology that they would just say oh no dad does all the sports and not acknowledge like all the invisible labor that went into Um Signing the kids up and making sure they had all their equipment and their uniforms and again providing the snacks for the team or whatever The parents are responsible for so I guess like physical labor default parenting and mental labor Would be the things that that women were frustrated by and with the mental labor They would speak specifically about their husbands having no idea about kind of what went on behind the scenes and all the things that they were thinking of So women when they become parents there's some work that shows that um they feel as if they should be thinking about their child all of the time Again, this is so um socio sociology and they do they do interviews in much the same way journalists do sociologists Um in qualitative research and men do not when they've become fathers feel that they should be thinking about their children all of the time And this has a lot to do with the different pressures that are in men and women societally in terms of what roles they're valued for and traditionally occupy So I mean it just It seems like you know we obviously have a long way to go and I would before we do like the closeout portion of the Of the episode I would love to know I'm gonna ask you like kind of the most annoying question that I'm sure Journalists ask you all the time when you're doing coverage for your book. I already know what it's gonna be tell me Oh really? Tell me I guess right Is there anything when you were doing all of your research that like you really didn't know before you dove into it? Because a lot of this means confirmatory right like we kind of already knew it But like really now we know the extent of it or like you know Those of us who are hip to this are like okay. Yeah, that that makes sense But is there anything where you're like holy shit? I had no idea Kara that's a great question. No one has asked me that oh, okay I won't tell you what it's like What no tell me what you thought tell me with that I thought well people are like so have you solved this problem in your relationship now Which is a totally valid question and I understand why people are Asking and I always feel like the answer should be yes, but the answer is still like totally no So yeah, they're pissed though I think I think we don't fund like once you get off on the wrong foot I think it's it's harder versus course and there's a lot of work in that and itself and Or Emma tired. I also don't know if this is something that is going to ever be solved I think it's something that you're just constantly working. Yeah, it is right right exactly equality is not an end point But a process but I will say I didn't know any of this when I started writing and I mean I guess I knew like that there was like a gendered labor thing in the home like I kind of vaguely knew that but I will say Um the first chapter of the book is about biology and our misunderstandings about biology And how we because like I would say to people you know, I do think this is and one of the answers I would get from people would be biology so it turns out That and I can't believe I didn't know this and that everybody doesn't know this because it's like just like Well documented did you know that men's hormones change when they spend time in in intimate contact with pregnant woman Oh, well, I know that there's like some of that kind of pregnancy sensitivity stuff that happens like their actual behavior and Conmitions can change I would assume there's some hormonal influence there right there's so I didn't know there's the same hormones that rise in women during pregnancy Rise in their partners now again, it's about intimate contact So if you get a woman pregnant as a result of a one night stand and you never see her again your hormones don't rise but if you spend time in close contact during the you know during pregnancy like prolactin oxytocin I'm gonna get it wrong because I'm not that kind of scientist like all those hormones rise and men So I didn't know that But men are biologically proimed to parents in the same ways that women are So that was something I didn't know and I also learned that there is no such literal thing as a maternal instinct Both men and women are wired to be attracted to small helpless creatures You know, this is probably why we like puppies and talvings right because we're kind of like orient like society would not have Our human beings would not would not continue to exist if we didn't get something emotionally out of taking care of small creatures Who can't care for themselves right the human race would get out so this is pretty much all mammals. Yeah Yes, although humans Stay attached to their offspring for much longer than other mammals Dogs apparently don't even recognize their offspring if they're separated from them For a while like I was so bad about taking my puppies from their mothers and then I thought oh, but not all mammals work the same way But primates seem to work this way So I and there's no such thing as a maternal instinct again parental love is innate. There's an innate component to it clearly There's an innate components most of what we do But parenting skills are learned and not innate for men as well as women And it's really about um learning and like learning by doing repeatedly And because of the way our society is structured Women do spend much more time and intimate contact with their babies especially early on than men Because of the way work is structured And then the learning curve is so different for each just because of the time invested and people kind of say well It's instinct and men just aren't as good and none of none of that is like biologically true And also it's insulting because it's like when somebody you know Works their ass off to get a PhD and then they go well, you're just really smart and you're like no I work my ass off right exactly Give me a little bit of credit here right human beings actually don't um survive based on instincts We have a Neo cortex Um, we rely on learning which allows a lot of flexibility in adapting to environments But it also means that most of what we do is not automatic and a lot of learning is required and parenting is certainly one of those things Good to know as I always wondered I always wondered if I was broken in that way because I love babies of my friend Maybe they're so cute and I love to poke them. I just don't want to have one You know, it's funny because I never liked kids all that much I always wanted a family But it wasn't because I loved being around children. It wasn't until I had my own Um, that something really did shift and you kind of like feel the biology at work And now I'm like I love kids my friend's kids. I love having relationships with them So something definitely changed in me and I think it is like neurobiological for again for men and women Both not just for me because I'm a woman and now I kind of like well I love kids now and that really shifted when I had them That's amazing and also very important because you are mother Yeah, yeah, it's very important but when people say like oh, I know I don't not really interested in kids. I don't want them. I mean I think that's a perfectly fine life decision don't get me wrong But I you know, I'm sometimes compelled to say to people like if I have a patient who says that well You know, it really does feel different when it is your own kid. Yeah, I know if I had a kid I would be super attached to it I but I also know that cognitively don't want to put myself in that position I think there's no reason to the world has plenty of people in fact We could probably do better if there were less people and it seems to be the way we might be going But there's a ton of stuff that surprised me actually like all the studies I found I didn't realize how Quantified the division of labor had been by like family researchers So I would say like so much of what I learned Just that there was research and like studies on it was all totally surprising There was a really interesting workplace study that shows that men behave the same way relative to women in the office as they do in the home So women end up doing much more of the Scott work of the office place than men So they're just like there were so many interesting studies I could have gone on researching this book for years and it would have been like a thousand pages But luckily I had a deadline. So That will not be inflicted upon me or anybody else Well, and that's why it's so important that you know people like yourself exist to our good kind of popularizers of this information Because like you said it does exist but people just don't know it Exactly. I know there's so much interesting research and sociology But unless you're an academic sociologist or a social psychologist You're not likely to come upon it So that's one of the things that I love being able to accomplish with my journalism And I hope I didn't do a disservice to any of their studies because sometimes they're you know complicated Um, but yeah, that was that was part of what I wanted to do kind of get this information that's only in academia out there So that people have it And of course guys that information is all contained in all the rage mothers fathers And the myth of equal partnership Darcy I know you got to go feed your kids But before you do I close every episode with the same two questions And I'm wondering if I would love to hear your perspective on these questions because as a psychotherap I really do think just like you mentioned earlier you were inspired by your therapist because Therapists really think about the world and in kind of a different way and so I'm very interested in your take on these Big picture however you want to slice it Whatever you want to answer number one What is the thing that keeps you up the most at night that you know when you think about the future you feel like You're like maybe pessimistic maybe cynical like things aren't looking good What are you really worried about and on the flip side when you think about the future What are you like genuinely optimistic about and I mean like authentically not like lip service? Yeah, no, no look at a really micro way I'm really concerned about where our country is politically and that disinformation And dishonest media are allowing our country to fall prey To just a really horrible time. I mean as we record this the impeachment hearings were this week And the facts are so clear and hearing the Republicans spin them. I find so disturbing I wish they would just say we don't you know, he's done these things. We don't care We don't want to Elizabeth Warren to be president like that would just an unmore honest dialogue Would make me a lot less anxious at least own it So that is keeping me up at night seriously and then in a more macro way climate change is keeping me up at night In fact, sometimes I feel like why am I bothering with gender equity like we all need to be focused on climate change Like the planet is so um, yeah, that's pretty and that's pretty dark But if you're asking what's keeping me up at night? Of course fears about my children's safety I think as every parent you know, we live in and um I don't know. I guess we I won't go into that But of course like you know, I want my kids to live long happy. I'll feel I've so that is that Repairance concern So that was that's what's keeping me up at night. What was the second question? On the flip side of that so we kind of end on more of a positive thing. What are you excited about? Um, well from what I understand if you step back a little the world is actually in a much better place than it's ever been Like globally poverty is down Social justice movements in this country and elsewhere have have had some success Gay people can get married in the United States legally The arc of the moral universe is long and it bends towards social justice, right? I think I didn't mess up that MLK quote so So that I mean, you know, there are vaccines. There are treatments for disease So I think those things are all really optimistic and um it can be hard to hold on to that stuff when one is worried about climate change But um, but there is also that agreed that's all I can say agreed Darcy. Thank you so much.
