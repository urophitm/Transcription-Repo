If you have a chance to get outside the city, away from the drone of traffic and glare of street lights, what do you hear? Crigots perhaps, cicadas, but if they're not, they're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. They're not. The better they look at you and see you. Sometimes it's amazing to see your children, or sometimes adults need to run at you to go to school, or start over to survive your life. But if it's a Fast and quick SUV you can find a car or activity in a way you can get closer, or catch a bird or a Wolverine boy. So if you are watching the So≈ºenia Wonder Woman, you please hold up your hand here and ask me that a new story extraordinary hearing and night vision. They occupy a sensory world unfamiliar to most of us. So what happens if we try to experience the world like an owl? We'd surely become a little wiser. This is Big Picture Science from the City Institute. I'm Molly Bentley. This episode is Night Flight. The first step in getting to know owls better is meeting them in their habitat. Excited by the prospect of seeing owls about a dozen of us met for an evening walk, led by a man who is professional singer by day and nature guide at night. Hello, I'm Tom Damianni. I'm leading the owl prowl here today. There's her night actually. You have a nice baritone. Is it a baritone? Yeah, I used to be a tenor. Okay, a nice tenor. Is that what draws the owls in or do you actually do an owl call? It's a whistle. Yeah, it's like they call it a horse's wini. We all gathered in front of a farmhouse in a wooded area on Long Island, while Tom laid out common sense tips before leading us on a walk into the woods. Being as quiet as possible and when we stop, everybody stops and try to be still. I think what we're going to do is walk where it's really dark in there because it's in the woods and deeper woods and it is dark in there. Remember, don't use your flashlight so let's you feel like you're going to trip or something and when you walk, kind of lift your feet instead of dragging them like that. All right. We were looking for two kinds of owls, the eastern screech owl and the great horned owl. I think a lot of people look at the great horned owl. They have these ear tough sticking up and people think those are their ears but they're not. Their eyes are set forward as a typical predator. The screech owl is a lot smaller. It's probably half the size and they look similar. They have smaller ear tuffs. I'm Carl Saphina. I'm an ecologist at Stony Brook University. Screech owls are the smallest owls that nest in the region that I live in which is Long Island New York and they are birds of woodlands and woodland edges. They are kind of like a very small version of a great horned owl. They don't even screech. They, well, they screech a bit if you do something like grab them. They'll screech as a threat. But normally they have a winy that sounds like a little winged horse somewhere up in a pine tree and what's called a tremolo call which is a trill. And you may also hear a sharp declarative kind of a whistled who but very sharp and short. So they have a whole repertoire. Can you do any of them? Could you do the winy? I'll try to do the trill. Let's see. That's a good enough effect somewhere to get an answer. I can get answers from wild owls with that one. The winy is a little actually a little harder although it's simpler. It's a descending whistle but the way that it whinny is a little hard to do something like that. I have had them answer me and I've had them fly right in, you know, right overhead. So clearly sometimes it's close enough that they need to check it out, that they think it may be an intruder. Now what is the guarantee that we'll see owls? I always say 50-50 chance. It may vary even by the time of the year because there are sometimes of the year when they are establishing territories and they're doing much more calling which is really singing. It's the same kind of repetitive call that says, I am here, this is my territory. I am here, where are you? Where are you? This is my territory. I am here. That's basically what to and sometimes of the year they're doing a lot of that and other times they're pretty quiet and things are a little bit more relaxed on that front. And hopefully we'll see here owls but realize that just walking at night is just this is something really cool to do. Just try to take that experience in so that it won't be disappointing regardless of what happens. So I like this area because it's got that edge, you know. Anytime you bird you always look for an edge kind of thing going on. So we have this like amphitheater situation happening right here. We got nice woods behind us but this edge here. So if the birds are deeper in the woods and they hear it they'll come out to that edge and you're more easily seen than if we were deep in the woods and kind of flying around there. But I'm going to be calling like that direction but definitely you know everybody kind of just looking different directions because it could come in from any way, coming from, you know, the left south, the east north way. I don't know where it's going to come from. I'm going to call here because I think that's the best place to do it. But it should be able to hear me behind me or on the sides too. Okay. So now I'm going to call. When we finally do here now I'll try to find it with my flashlight. If you happen to have a flashlight and I'm not seeing it and you see movement you can certainly get on that. But when you do get on, I'll don't shine it directly in its eyes. So you put it on its body and its feet, the breast but not directly in the eyes itself. Their eyes are real super sensitive so that bright light is not a good thing to do to them. I wonder if you knowing owls and other animals the way that you do. If you could imagine a scene where maybe a dozen humans are walking through the woods long island and we're looking for owls but from the owls perspective I assume they're in the tree somewhere. What is the scene unfolding for them? Where might they be perched? What are they seen? How do you think they're reacting to this scene? Tell us what the owl is. I won't say thinking but perhaps perceiving. Probably they are perched somewhere near the edge of an opening where if they haven't already eaten they'd be looking for anything ranging from moths and beetles to mice and shrews to small birds that are roosting who would be hiding in dense cover in low bushes probably. I think that's what they would probably be doing. If they've already eaten they'd probably just be sitting there waiting and resting and hanging out and then all of a sudden to their extraordinarily sensitive ears a gigantic amount of noise from people walking through the woods. We were trying to be quiet I can say. I'm sure but I've been out with groups of people and my impression is that more than two people are incapable of remaining quiet. This is lost face you can get in your car and go now or you can follow me we're going down the other side. All right here we go. We kept walking for a while Tom continued his screech owl calls and while the night was filled with the sounds of crickets and catedids we did not hear the winy or the trail in response. So I guess we'll head back. We called it a night and thanked Tom but before we parted I asked whether his singing repertoire included songs about owls and kuddy sing one. Oh so there's got to be a song. Oh yeah there is a song walking my baby back home. owls go by and they give me the eye walking my baby back home. That's that's the line with owl part in it yeah that's right. Thanks again to our nature guide Tom Damianny. Walking my baby back home. Well we did not see an owl that night but the owl prowl was still a lot of fun and even though we missed seeing them we can get to know owls better and helping us to do that while my co-host Seth Chastek is away is science writer Gordy Slack who has written extensively about the natural world including reporting about owls. Hi Gordy. Hey Molly I loved the owl song that Tom is saying the idea of him out there singing to the owls and the hope that maybe he can establish some rapport is a lovely one. First singing in their language and then singing in his language. Would be great if they would reply in a human song but I guess that'll be a few million years before they can do that. You know I love the idea of the owl walk as a way for humans to try to get closer not just to owl populations and individual owls but to the natural world in general because you're out there it's dark humans are diurnal they're not made for those habitats or that time of day and so our senses all become super heightened and we put our own minds behind the eyes of these owls that we're looking for and whether you find them or not it's just a great exercise. You are a big fan of owls I in fact I don't know who is not a big fan of owls and can you make the case for getting to know the owl better. I think so I mean unlike most other birds owls are almost all nocturnal and so they occupy a part of the world that makes humans very uncomfortable on the whole so right away when you go to look for owls you find yourself immersed in a part of nature that heightens your senses that gets you out of your habitual ways of thinking. Owls have been fascinating to every culture we know of because of their nocturnal nature's and their weird sounds weird and wonderful sounds but they also look kind of like people you know when you look into an owl's face it's a lot more like looking into a human face than most birds their heads are kind of boxy and their eyes are in front of their faces unlike most birds and they will just look at you with both eyes at the same time the way another person might a small feathered person. Now here's the sound of a real screech owl. Ecologist Carl Saphina is often called upon to care for injured animals in the wooded area on Long Island where he lives. One of them became the basis for an illuminating and endearing relationship that he describes in his book Alfie and me what owls know what humans believe. Well Carl you began a close relationship a couple years ago with a screech owl you named Alfie. When you met her she was in bad shape and near death could you describe how you met her and what her circumstances were. I got a text with a photo of a very very bedraggled looking little fluffy well not even fluffy her down was all matted it it was a bird and it was from a wildlife rehabilitator and the question was do you know what kind of bird this bedraggled little thing is and I said well it's an owl and judging from how small it is and that it's an nestling here it's a screech owl and her eyes were closed she was probably 10 days old or so so a thing about that there's a couple of things about that one one is that they nest inside cavities like holes in trees and they can't fall out of a deep nest so something must have been raiding the nest and dropped her part way to where she was being carried so maybe a crow had found the nest and was raiding it maybe she's the only survivor I don't know but at any rate there was no apparent nest in sight in the book you describe she was covered in maggots and she was covered with fly eggs or fly eggs if they had hatched the maggots would immediately just start burrowing into her and eating her from the inside out so she was you know a couple of hours away probably from dying but the rehabber cleaned her and warmed her up really nicely the rehabber was very good at stabilizing the bird and a couple of weeks later she was at our home with the owl she had actually been house sitting for us and then she had to go overseas for a fellowship and I just said well leave the owl here we'll manage a soft release in our backyard because I've had a lot of birds I've done a lot of rehab I know how to do all of this soft release what is that a soft release is when you allow a young animal to basically just widen its circle of movement until it wanders off on its own and meanwhile you're still supplementing food while they learn how to forage and that's the way it would normally happen in nature normally with owls they leave the nest and then for about three weeks the parents are feeding them while they are getting stronger they are learning how to maneuver their starting to hunt so we wanted to replicate that you said that you have worked with many wild animals you've actually helped injured wild animals to heal but yet you also write that bringing Alfie home was a little nerve-wracking and you said that like all babies she did not come with instructions what are the particular challenges of nursing a little owl to health there were a couple of things I think the first thing is good food and they eat basically they eat animal food they eat insects they eat meat of various kinds you know in the form of rodents and small birds in the south they eat lizards and snakes too and they eat fish so immediately you know the thing was here's a little little owl that needs good quality food so we procured good quality food for her in a variety of ways and the second thing is that I wanted her to have plenty of stimulation and freedom of movement so she was never in a cage and that was important also was she indoors and outdoors it sometimes she was in your house and sometimes she was outdoors near a chicken coop but there was wiring around that was well well the thing is that the plan went a little awry because her flight was delayed she did not get two-thirds of the feathers that create flight on her wings two-thirds of her wings were bare when she should have just been able to go and she was only capable of flopping around and then by the time that I waited through a mold to see that those feathers would come in properly and that she would in fact be able to fly because I was afraid maybe she would just have captive and unreleasable for her whole life but by that time it was getting to be mid-autumn and food was getting you know a lot less abundant normally a wild owl would be learning all summer long how to catch bugs and then how to catch mice and how to hunt for small birds but now here she was able to fly for the first time with all the food either going away literally or just much much less abundant and she had the ability to fly in no skills so at that point I customized the outdoor part of our chicken coop for her and we kept her in a protective custody through the winter and the spring until early the next summer I started flight training with her and hunting training with her by pulling a fake mouse on a string and you know the thing is they fly instinctively and they chase instinctively but to catch something requires a lot of skill and that's what I was trying to help her get so when you describe feeding Alfie the images coming to mind as you running around catching beetles and crickets and mice how did you figure what I actually don't remember the first thing I fed her but in an extreme pinch I probably would have just gotten a little bit of chicken from the supermarket for her and cook did of course but I know I did catch a lot of crickets for her I caught you did feed her mice I caught a few mice and I fed her a lot of mice that I bought online you can buy mice online because there are a lot of people who have pet snakes and things like that and there's a there's a whole little industry to provide rodents for them do they come alive and then you kill them luckily for me they come frozen coming up the extraordinary way owls perceive the world as we continue our night flight on this episode of Big Picture Science Ryan Reynolds here from Mint

rely more on my hearing as my eyes adjusted to the darkness it was a way to consider what it means to experience the world the way nocturnal animals do such as owls Carl Savina describes the keen sensory perception of owls and how we might be enlightened by taking time to observe other animals as he did with an injured owllet who came into his care that he named Alfie my whole life with animals and my whole career as an ecologist I think has given me an extension of observational orientation and maybe skill I would say to see a lot of the non-human world and I know that a lot of people don't see a lot of this they're not you know they're not oriented to it they don't look for it they don't know what's there to look for and you know into a much different extent I do but with Alfie because her freedom coincided with the shutdowns of the COVID pandemic I had nowhere to go and nothing better to do than to watch her and eventually watch her with her mate and her family in my backyard and I did that for about five hours a day if owls aside if you sat in your backyard looking and listening for five hours a day you would see a lot that you don't see you really sat in your backyard for five hours a day yes and watched the owls yes I would often get up a little before dawn and I and I'd watch through first light and dawn and then the same kind of thing around sunset and sundown two or three hours each time and and you're kind of amusing thing as I say to people I watch the owls for five hours a day and they're oh how could you do that isn't that boring a lot of those people sit in a cubicle in an office for eight hours a day which would be impossible for me to do you have this little owl in your care and can you describe your relationship to it and how it was changing like how you were beginning to feel some I mean I suppose affection is a mild way of putting it yeah you were really getting attached and how was she relating to you and was she afraid or was she in such a vulnerable state that she was and maybe never met a human before that she was tamed her she was calm in your presence did that take time it did not take any time because literally from the time she opened her eyes there were people there and the people had always only taken good care of her so she was never nervous around us at all and that didn't surprise me and maybe you were a little more nervous around her I thought maybe yes maybe I thought we would only have her for you know a week or two what did very much start to surprise me was how extremely interactive she was and then in some ways how playful she was at that at that age which she liked to play and grab things and pounce on things and sometimes she would come looking for us if she was alone she'd be fine for a little while and then sometimes she would come looking for us and if she found us she would stay in our presence for a while as though our presence made her feel a little safer which I really think is the case I think that's why she did that so it started to become much more of a two way kind of a thing and that was surprising and of course I think at the point in which we weren't just taking care of her but she was responding to us I started to realize that there was just a lot more depth in that little personality and it was a two way thing did you ever feel like you had to struggle with anthropomorphism that you found yourself you know describing the owl in human terms and is that okay to do can we talk about the owl loving you or or being playful or do you worry about that or did you ever struggle with how to describe it no because really anthropomorphism is when you project human thoughts and emotions onto other creatures but if you observe their emotional and intellectual capacities you're not anthropomorphizing a lot of times scientists say or and we're taught as as scientists in training you're not allowed to attribute human thoughts and emotions to other creatures but that's not scientific in science you're supposed to go with what the evidence shows the fact of the matter is we are organically related we have the same basic nervous system and we have exactly the same hormones that create mood and motivation so if an animal acts like they're hungry it's because they're hungry if they act like they're afraid and you can obviously see what they're afraid of if if a cat or an unfamiliar dog comes in the room and a bird shrieks or cat comes in the yard and all the birds fly off the bird feeder it's because they're afraid that's totally appropriate there's no other reasonable response to or explanation for what their motive is we have the same vertebrate nervous system so you know to say oh you can't say they're afraid or you can't say they're experiencing well-being or you can't say that they enjoy doing something useless that they're doing over and over again when they're playing I mean just look at dogs dogs obviously have these emotions and they obviously have some thoughts and little plans if they go to the door and bark it's because they need to go out or they want to go out they have desires they have needs and these things feel to them that these are motivations that make them do things does that include anthropomorphize does it include love do you think that alphie loves you loved you well love is a huge range of emotions and motives it's a it's a simple word that we apply to a ridiculous array of things we can say I love my mother I love my children I love this coffee I love this coffee I love ice cream I love going shopping for shoes so what in the world does love mean but if you if it means the kind of feeling that makes you want to be near someone that you know well then they do love you and dogs do love you yes now as her adult feathers come in she's this gorgeous tapestry of ginger and white could you describe this because you say you could hardly take your eyes off of her and also how are those stripes in that that pattern how is that adaptive for an hour well the the first set of feathers is like gray flannel pajamas and and I have to say as a human they look really adorable those little baby owls and come so yes and then they molt into what you're describing this kind of ginger and white I mean there's a long long list of words you can use to describe them they have white little eyebrows they have those ear tufts that look like cats ears but those are just feathers they have that facial disc of feathers that really gives them a face that humans relate to their body is barred and streaked sort of alternating cream and chocolate and ginger and all of that part is camouflage for them because if if they get really uncomfortable you know if they see a predator and they want to hide they don't move and hide they stretch and then all of those streaks look like tree bark and those little ear tufts go up and they just look like twigs they are really really hard to see in a tree if they're doing that amazing as Alfie learned to fly you write that she would a light from a bookshelf or a chair and then she'd be gone and it was surprising because you never heard her do it how is an owl's wing designed to produce these remarkable silent flights they are completely silent if she flies directly across my face I cannot hear a thing and that is created basically by little structures all over their feathers that break up the flow of air that would create little whistling noises so at the trailing edges of the feathers have tiny tiny little fringes you don't see them as fringes you'd have to look with at least a magnifying glass maybe a microscope the same thing with the leading edge and the other thing is their whole body is very very very soft because the whole body even even the feathers that look smooth they have a little microscopic layer of fluff on them and that breaks up the flow of air makes them silent and how are Alfie and other owls adapted for nightlife one of the features is their silent one of the features for hunting at night is that they're silent and another is that they see very well in very low light one thing about that is that some owls have such fine hearing well all owls have very fine hearing their ears are big openings on the side of their head and they are asymmetrical one a little higher than the other so they can detect the direction sound is coming from better than anything and in total darkness in a dark room with no windows with the doors closed they can catch mice by the sound of a mouse moving around because the asymmetry means that one set of sound waves is reaching I mean the sound waves are reaching one side of the head just slightly later than than the other side maybe think of it this way we we know what direction sound is coming from because it hits one ear at a different time than it hits the other ear and we instinctively turn toward the one it hit first but they also have one ear that's a little higher so not only left and right but up and down is very easy for them so they can really really detect the direction that the sound is coming from very very finely why do they hunt at night because there are other things hunting during the day and there are a lot of things to eat that are active only at night that are not accessible to day predators like hawks so you know there are different kinds of animals that are adapted basically around the clock to making a living in all these different ways owls are the hunters of the night the aerial hunters of the night and you said they have exquisite eyesight so while we were walking through those woods they were certainly hearing us but they were seeing us too even though we couldn't see them they were in their purchase looking down at those animals traipsing through their habitat yes absolutely in fact we're not we're getting a little ahead of the alpha story but when her first brood of chicks was out of the nest they would they would roost for a few weeks they would roost within 20 feet of the same spot up about about 15 or 20 feet off the ground in a couple of young maple trees right at the side of our street and very frequently people would jog by with all of the owls the three three chicks the two adults all watching these people walking and jogging and talking and they of course had absolutely no idea they were being surveilled you know I wondered as I read how you cared for Alfie and other owls that came into your care we know that predator and prey relationships define the relationships in nature but was it hard for you to balance the protective emotions that were involved in the care for one animal while watching it feed on another animal because in the case where it's maybe a sparrow I could imagine a situation where you would care for an injured sparrow so how do you balance those emotions of the protective care and also letting nature do its thing well I mean we're stuck with the world we're stuck with in in many ways that's that's the world we're in the world we're in is that plants make animals take and I do have all of those feelings and I you know and I've been on different sides of that I've cared for animals that are prey to other animals I've cared for animals that are predators to other animals I've actually seen mice that were brought to the nest by Alfie's mate and you know I've kind of like look to see was that mouse nursing young ones when she was caught I mean these things happen in the world there's no way around that on this planet anyway so emotionally you have to find yourself and somewhere in as you're watching this very closely I mean not everyone is watching well the way that I the way that I find it it find my place in that question is these things yes they are in some way very distressing but they work they've they've worked for life on this planet for several billion years and because that system works and it has proliferated and covered this entire planet with extraordinarily abundant life I'm not really one to criticize that system despite my emotional responses to some of it whereas what people are doing to the world is actually undermining the ability of the world to support life and destabilizing the life supporting systems on the planet there's a word that describes how an animal experiences the world and applies to plants too that is how their senses take it in and it's called um belt you've described some of it in describing Alfie and other owls but could you say more about the um belt of an owl sure there are a lot of people who think that the way that a different species perceives is completely different and unknowable from the way that a human perceives and that is demonstrably not true there's a very significant amount of overlap between the way that most vertebrates let's just say mammals and birds for instance perceive in the way that we do they have eyes to see so there's they have a visual sense of the world many of them have a colored sense of the world we we know that some of them see colors we cannot see we know some of them here frequencies we cannot hear but there's overlap in what they see there's overlap in what they hear we have a sense of smell we know it's not nearly as good as a dog's but we know what a sense of smell is like and we know that most birds like owls have a quite poor sense of smell although some have a quite good sense of smell we know that they have a sense of touch we we know that when they see something that they want to catch move they feel motivated to chase it so these things I think are all very very comprehensible on top of that with a few birds like parrots and like alphie the owl they enjoy physical affection because they preen each other the mates preen each other the young and the adults preen each other that is a bonding function mammals certain mammals preen each other people preen each other and they enjoy being preened why do I say they enjoy because they will come to you they they will solicit your preening often by just bowing their head and then they'll lean into it so there's a lot of overlap what is really different is that when when the night goes completely dark for us a lot of animals actually can see quite well a lot of them can hear much better or smell much better many of them have superhuman powers really and the three dimensionality that flight gives you is something I think we can kind of easily imagine but it's got to be you know it's got to feel very different for them just the ability to move so freely I love how Carl describes that when night goes dark for us the world comes alive for alphie and other owls it's such great exercise to imagine what the experience of another animal especially a wild animal is like when it's so different than ours and it's it's very rare do you actually have a relationship with one yes I mean it's one thing to see an animal in the distance or maybe that animal comes into your yard every day those are brief encounters um what strikes you about what's revealed by Carl's account of having a sustained relationship with the wild animal does it contribute anything new to our understanding of wild animals I think it does Carl spent so much time with alphie five hours a day over many months and that's extraordinary isn't it yeah it sounds like a great way to pass the time to me he he was able to watch her evolve as a individual not just as a representative of the species but as an individual living being and that insight that owls and other wild animals are individuals is one we don't often get to appreciate and that that has consequences for how we regard these other beings on this planet uh these other living creatures absolutely for one thing it reveals to us or reminds us that there are relatives and as Carl says they're close relatives they're built like we are out of the same ingredients they have the same physical structure and the same neurological makeup right if you compare us to plants for example exactly we resemble alphie more than we do a hydrangea or a cockroach yeah and it's like finding a fantastic cousin that you didn't know you were related to and being able to explore your relationship to them is just such a such a treasure such an opportunity well coming up Carl asks does alphie even know she's an owl and he makes an attempt to release her into the wild and what do you think Gordy do you think he'll be successful releasing her I think he might have a harder time breaking the relationship off than she does okay well we'll see what happens next as we continue this night flight on big picture science so support comes from service now we're for people doing the creative work they actually want to do that's why this ad was written and read by a real person and not AI you know what people don't want to do boring busy work now with AI agents built into the service now platform you can automate millions of repetitive tasks in every corner of your business IT HR and more so your people can focus on the work that they want to do that's putting AI agents to work for people it's your turn visit servicenow.com we continue our conversation with the colleges Carl Saphina about the owl that came into his care named alphie and what it means to leave room for the stunning diversity of animals on this planet something that dr. Saphina has referred to as the other living world his book is alphie and me what owls know what humans believe as you cared for this little owl you worry that because she was in protective custody as you said she might not develop her wild instincts and you observe that she needed meaningful risks which I thought was an interesting phrase and an important and you asked does alphie realize she's an owl what are meaningful risks for an owl and did alphie realize or when did she realize she was an owl I think you know in my training I would have said in a professional sense that alphie was imprinted that that her identity was that she was one of us that she would have thought that she was basically a human animal didn't really know what she was but that turned out to be completely not true she just very gracefully and fully summoned her owlness and we saw that immediately when a wild owl came to be her suitor as she began her free flying life and she responded very appropriately although the very interesting thing was that at first she was very very tentative and not trusting at first when he tried to provide food for her she was not very accepting fairly quickly they got comfortable with each other so this was a process not unlike the process that we know in human courtship you're a little tentative at first you're not exactly sure who you're who you're interacting with you you get to know them better you get more trusting you get more relaxed the same thing with physical mating at first she was very very awkward and unskilled and then the sex came much much more easily much more avidly in that whole courtship period that was the main thing that I got was that all of these little nuances not just birds behave this way owls do this during courtship but that courtship was a an unfolding process not a categorical phase did you observe all of that but you watched the courtship and you watched all of this stuff yes because Alfie was completely tame with me and I could watch her at point blank range and her her suitor was taking his cues from her at at first he was much more hesitant about our presence and then you know kind of watching her kind of being cute to her and kind of just me being there all the time it got to the point where I could easily be about 30 feet away and he would just do all of his normal stuff hunting delivering food initiating mating all of that stuff with with no regard to the fact that I was just standing there taking notes or taking photographs and with Alfie she couldn't have cared less if I was literally right next to her right at the nest so some version of having the parents sit in on that first date when you're a teenager and they're in the room oh god what a horrible thought that is but of course you never relax in that case I guess yeah and as far as the meaningful risks I mean I was just going to ask the meaningful life is dangerous safety is a total dead end we could stay in bed all the time and be safe that would not be life so to have any kind of shot at you know the great chain of being and to exert all of her capacities physically mentally emotionally relationally with her mate the possibility of you know procreating that required the risks of freedom and the risks of freedom have to do with being subject to the dangers of very bad weather of predation from things like the Cooper's Hawks that come through our yard all the cats that come through our yard and the possibility of getting sick the possibility of starving especially in the winter that is life as Alfie gets stronger you embark on a series of attempts to let her go and there were some moments where you couldn't do it you intended to let her go and you weren't able to do it and you'd put it off for another day could you describe the process by which you did release her back to the wild I was I was coaxing her out of the coop to come and get food and to to chase the fake mouse on a string and things like that and then usually I would put her right back one day she just touched my arm and went up in a tree and this started a series of for over a short period of time of me trying to get her down and put her in the coop again because I was afraid to have her just free so suddenly but when I did that I then I almost immediately realized well isn't that what this is all about shouldn't I have just left her out and left the door open which I then did there was one very very rainy night I intended to leave the door open and I thought I don't want her loose for the first time in a total downpour I don't know if she can cope with that so I waited one day but then then I just you know as I said I have to rip the bandaid off here and take the plunge and and my my worst fear happened she disappeared for a whole week we left food out it wasn't taken she was not around but then she came back one night at 11 p.m. she just landed on our deck and or in a tree on our deck and she has never left she centered her territory around our home she attracted a wild mate they raised three young ones in a box that I put up on the outside of my writing studio and the whole cycle of life went off perfectly couldn't have been a better ending it could not have been better and is Alfie still part of your world? Alfie is very much part of our world we still see her at least several times a week and she still lives somewhere in and around our backyard although I'm not always sure where she has a couple of favorite roosts one of which I know rather well and and the others I don't know where they are well finally Carl the last time we spoke for this program you said something to me which I've often quoted you had corrected me when I said well it sounds like we need to make room for other animals and you said no we should leave room for them they were here first and how well are we doing in that endeavor and what can people do individually or collectively to ensure that we leave room I know that this is a big question but if we if we think about your relationship with Alfie and what was revealed was that the world the natural world is a series of relationships I would assume that that is one place where we start to leave room for other animals sure that's true we're doing catastrophically in that regard something like 96% of all the mammals in the world are now livestock and human beings the wild animals are being banished from the face of the earth so we need to leave room and many of us can make some room many of us live somewhere where there's a backyard or something like that one of the things I do is I simply never use any pesticides on anything we try to have a safe backyard the last few years I have stopped mowing the lawn in the spring and early summer gets to be a very shaggy lawn but that lawn gets to be full of fireflies so and then later at the grass goes to seed and I see lots of sparrows coming to our yard to eat the grass seeds so we have little habitat there people can plant pollinator gardens you can plant a pollinator garden on a terrace or on a roofed you can do these little things that matter you can try to buy organically grown food and be aware of some of the implications of what you're eating so we make decisions every day that matter to other living things and just realizing that makes a big difference I wonder if stopping to observe an animal a wild animal would also help now we can't all spend five hours watching owls although we might want to but actually taking the time to watch an animal and consider its world its own belt that it has a right to be in this world too instead of just passing by as though they were the background to our lives sure or not even there I I frequently stop and watch all kinds of little things I just find almost all kinds of animals really beautiful I just I just enjoy them and everything they do seems to interest me but if you you know if you if you get in with a group of bird watchers for instance you you will have your eyes really opened to the incredible diversity and beauty that is in any region I mean we're in New York City right at the moment in this region right here there's probably 300 roughly 300 species of birds that either nest or migrate through this region alone on a good day during spring migration a really good birder can see a hundred species I think most people if you asked them to name 10 species of wild birds they wouldn't know so one one species of the human animal and 300 species of birds are here in the city right there's a little perspective in that Carl Saphina is an ecologist at Stony Brook University and he is the author of Alfie and me what owls know what humans believe Carl thank you so much for joining us again on the program well this was a lot of fun and much too brief so Gordy now we come to the big picture of the show what is it for you in this episode about owls one thing that really stood out is the discussion that you two had about there being so many species I think 300 species of birds in New York City and one species of upright primate so the story that we tend to think of as human centric of what's happening in New York I mean of course what's happening is largely about human beings but take a step back and what's happening is about birds I mean birds and insects and rats and rats we know rats too uh for petrower words yeah and so I just love how Carl is able to shift the emphasis from a bird an owl as an object to an owl as a unfolding story and a living being with with interests and loves and needs and then on top of all of that it is just a pure joy to go from the one column of the human made world and step into the column of the wild world and get to know it a little bit better I couldn't agree more you often hear about this epidemic of loneliness well there's a huge world of possible relationships out there in your closet in the tree outside in your house in your closet sure I mean they're spiders they're ants as EO Wilson once said if you want to find the most interesting thing in your house just leave a little bit of honey out for the ants to find and you know you can have a thousand relationships and even just even if it is limited to observation which it mostly should be still there are whole worlds out there to discover in our yards in the trees along our streets and it's a world we share with these magnificent relatives of ours well gory thank you for taking this night flight with us and helping us put ourselves into the feathered shoes of owls it was my pleasure molly gory slack is a science writer who writes about the natural world this show
