BAM incredible I can't think seriously anyway I'm a very very serious person Welcome to episode two of the curious case of Ruffin and Fry In this episode, actually what is this episode called? This is the curious case of the sinister hand, this is part two The first time we've done a two-parter We didn't think of a second title though Oh that's a bit lazy Part two? I think I can't have a second title But it should be like the return of the hand That's true actually, we'll do that in series four This is such an epic subject handedness I know it's incredible And we devote two programs to it I hadn't realised just how much there was to know And just how much we don't know about left and right handedness Yes, but we're getting stuck into it Now listeners need to be very aware that The words left and right come up a lot And you have to concentrate quite hard to make sure you know you're talking about the right thing The right thing Correct, the script writing was a bit of a nightmare What are we left with? Oh no too many left Say yes, there's a lot of those appear So we're going from straight forward handedness Which is what we were talking about in episode one Two, how that actually comes about inside your brain And how being left or right handed might influence your behaviour So on with the brains Part two of the curious case of the sinister hand Now in the first episode we investigated the following questions sent into us by Neil Shepperson Yes, what determines left or right handedness And why are us lefties in the minority We looked at chimps, whales and cockaties And discovered that this ratio of one in ten lefties is unique to humans Now this bias is very unusual, so this got us thinking Well why does it exist at all? And our lefties different now some researchers point to a link between left handedness And conditions like autism and dyslexia But others say that left hand is a more creative And is this related to the notion that some people are left or right brained? Well I have been told in the past actually I must be right brained because I am insufferably logical Not insufferably, but you want mathematicians to be logical A little bit I guess And the logical mathematician is hopeless But the real question is does it make your brain lopsided? Well to get to the bottom of that I consulted my favourite neuroscientist, Professor Sophie Scott You often see tests on the internet asking whether your left brain or right brained And whether that makes you more emotional or analytical Is there any truth to any of that? No, I am sure it is possible that people might vary in how emotional and analytical they are But that almost certainly does not relate in a simple way to you Like loading more heavily on one hemisphere or the other There are definitely differences between the left side of the brain and the right side of the brain So in most people language that is something that lives if you like in the left side of the brain And the right side of the brain is associated with lots of nonverbal stuff like understanding melody and music or recognizing faces So pretty much everybody is using both the left and the right side of the brain all the time How does being left handed or right handed translate to what is going on in your brain? What happens when we act on the world and when we perceive the world is that the opposite side of the brain deals with the other side of the body So when I am moving my right hand it is actually the left brain that is in charge of that in terms of motor control And if I feel something in my right hand fingers it is the left side of my brain that is sensing that in terms of tactile sensation And there is a bit of the brain rather delightfully called the hand knob I don't know if you can find the business of the brain that represents and controls hand movements I can't believe I didn't know there was an area of the brain called the hand knob You know I thought you would like that bit Adam but the important fact to keep in mind for the rest of this program And I have to be honest the thing that does make the quite tricky in places is that the left side of the brain controls the right hand and vice versa You have this cross wiring in the body Fine I think I can just about manage that Now Sophie mentioned that for most of us the capacity for language sits in the left side of our brain in what is called Brockers area Now in the 1960s scientists studying Brockers area devise an experiment called diacotic listening which we are going to do on you now So to play along you need to put on a pair of stereo headphones make sure you get the ears the right way around And if you are listening to this on the radio you can download the podcast on the BBC website and then have a listen to this Beard, Pope, Dish, Doomed, Dove, Weave, Clam That was really quite weird Okay but what words did you hear? Rot, Dove, Clam So those were all words that were being played into your right ear so there wasn't the left ear word Beard, Pump, Dish, Doom, Loaf, Weave Now for most people the words in their right ear are processed much more precisely And all of that is controlled in the left hemisphere of your brain where most people have their language centres So for right-handed people it means that they have the same side of their brain in charge of language and their dominant hand According to psychologist Professor Chris McManus author of right hand, left hand, that connection is no accident My theory this is that it's the same genes that make us right or left-handed They're pushing our hand in this control centres into either one hemisphere or the other They're also pushing language into one hemisphere or the other Why would there be a connection between the language area of your brain and the hand motor control areas of your brain? When I talk to you I have to move my lips, my mouth, my larynx incredibly fast And get it with precise coordination and timing Language requires a lot of very fast processing But actually if you think about what you do with the tips of your fingers when you're writing Your fingers are moving incredibly fast in a very precise way And if you're making a stone tool everything has to be made with great precision in timing So I think probably the left hemisphere is actually faster It's got higher clock speed if you like, you've got yourself a 400mHz rather than the 200mHz If it was a computer, something like that So Chris's idea goes like this Speech and languages in the left brain for most people Around two million years ago when humans began to evolve language That side of the brain also became dominant in controlling our right-handedness Because that was the most efficient way for our brains to work with language and hand control Both managed by the same side Sounds good but if that was absolutely the case Surely it would make sense for left-handed people to have their brains Flipped around the other way So their language centres along with their control for their dominant hand All in the right-hand side of the brain Yeah, a bit of a problem there See we don't see that 30% of left-handers have their speech centres on the same side as right-handers So it's not flipped and then 5% of right-handers have language on the opposite side to what you'd expect to Studying humans is really complex Yes it is But there is another theory in town A new hypothesis about hand-dness And the brain that doesn't involve language at all And it starts with the tale of Charles Dickens in his twilight years Age 57 Dickens was on a grueling farewell tour of public readings And thus to notice some rather strange symptoms He was rushed to see the Queen's doctor, Sir Thomas Watson, who reported thus He has some odd feeling of insecurity about his left leg As if there was something unnatural about his heel Also he spoke of some strangeness of his left hand and arm An unreddiness to lift his hands, especially his left hand When, for instance, he was brushing his hair The following year Dickens had an even stranger experience Walking up Oxford Street's famous shopping parade in London He suddenly couldn't read signs above the shops that lay on the left hand side of the road He collapsed at dinner on the 8th of June 1870 and died the following evening And it was later discovered that Dickens had damaged to the right hemisphere of his brain The symptoms he showed just before death seemed to mirror what we now know as left neglect Here's Sophie Scott again People with left neglect just behave like the left side of space is not there So a man shaving himself in the mirror will only shave the right side of his face And somebody eating a meal will only eat the food on the right side of the day And not even realise that they're ignoring the other side Exactly, and it's not that they can't see that side of space And it's not that they can't hear things on that side It seems to be hard to actually pull attention over to that side of space Now you get left neglect after damage mostly to the right side of the brain Remembering the right side of the brain is responsible for attention to the left side of space and vice versa Now what people have started to think is that this might suggest that actually attention In the left side of the brain and the right side of the brain operate slightly differently The attention system in the left side of the brain is really really focused And it's really really strong Whereas the attention system in the right side of the brain is much more diffuse Such that if you damage the attention system in the right side of the brain You just get this really focused right pulling over Which means that you ignore the left because you can't disengage from this stuff pulling you over to the right hand side Right, there were a lot of left and right in there So I need you to do that again for me please Okay, so let's say that you're right handed Your right hand side is dominant because one half of your brain, your left half Is really really focused on what your right side is doing Meanwhile the other half of your brain is taking care of the bigger picture And that means if you damage the right hand side of your brain, the one giving you the big picture You no longer have anything paying attention to the left side of your body All that remains is the very sharp focused attention on your dominant right side Right, I mean, no not right, I mean, okay That does make sense But that only makes sense if you're right handed, what about the lefties? Well, the evidence is starting to emerge that you do not find left neglect in left handed people Right, so now I'm really confused how does that work Okay, so the theory here is that brain areas and left handers are flipped over So there it's the right brain that's fine tuned to pay attention to the left side of the body So you're still left with a big picture Even when a left hander does damage to the right side of their brain What we're getting here is that whether you're right or left handed, it could just be down to which side your brain is better at paying focused attention Yeah, correct one, that's the theory anyway Okay, that's one of the ideas about what's different in lefty brains But does any of this have any effect on behavior? I'm Dorothy Bishop and I'm professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford I became interested in handedness research because I myself am left handed and I always wondered why I was different from other people During her research Dorothy came across hundreds of stories about how left handers are somehow different There have been all sorts of claims over the years linking handedness with various disabilities, things like dyslexia and autism On the other hand, there have been things linking to positive attributes Like it's been claimed that architects are more likely to be left handed on musicians In general, the evidence isn't all that good If I go and look at all the left handers I can find, you know, a thousand left handers from the general population and compare them to a load of right handers The odds of me finding any difference between them in things like intelligence or music ability or reading ability is pretty poor But then if I turn the question on its head and I say let me find people who are having major problems with their language development or who have a known condition such as Down syndrome, what's the handedness distribution there It is the case that you then are more likely to find it's closer to 50-50 rather than the usual 90% right handed, 10% left And what it also tells us is that it's not the left hand in itself that is creating problems It's more that it can be a symptom of some underlying condition But in most people it doesn't seem that it has any significance at all for intellectual cognitive development So there you go, then left handers can take some of this It does not affect your cognitive development Yes, but on the other hand, see what I did there, it might not be the source of your creative genius either So Dr. Fry, can we say K-Soul? Well, we did discover that language and control of your dominant hand tends to be in the same hemisphere of your brain But not always And it might be that being right and left handed is just down to which side of your brain is paying more attention But not necessarily, even to really annoying, aren't we? Well, you are So there we go, more than you ever knew you needed to know about left and right handedness And yet, I don't think we really solved that one, did we? I quite like that we didn't come to a conclusion there because I think sometimes the stuff we're presenting here is real active theories Right? Yes, we don't know the answers to these questions Yeah, this is a really active area of research, neuroscience of handness and brain hemispheres And of course, that's what all sciences lie And Sherlock often didn't solve his cases No, I don't think that's true, I think he solved all of them every single time Well, if you'd still like to hear a bit more about left and right handedness, then you can go to my article on the BBC Future website Address? Yes, BBC.com forward slash future Of course, we still want you to send in your curious cases for us to try and solve, or in this case, not actually solve To curiouscases at bbc.co.uk Indeed, so thank you very much to Michelle Martin, our wonderful producer and to the team at BBC Future And we'll see you in the next episode Bye
