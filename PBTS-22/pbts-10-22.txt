And I'm glad to have you with me today, and I want to give a special thanks to everyone out there who has reviewed our podcasts on iTunes or reached out to tell us about your favorite scientists. It is wonderful to meet you and get some feedback on our show. So if you haven't introduced yourself yet, you can find us on Twitter at PBT Science or tweet to me at PhD Marie. You can also check us out on Facebook or email us at contact at peoplebehindtheScience.com. Now let's get started. Don't have some fantastic stories to share with us today. So get ready to meet another one of our wonderful people behind the science. Every day discoveries are made that will change our understanding of the world around us. Dr. Marie McNeely is here to bring you the brilliant minds who are making these discoveries so they can share their incredible stories and take you on an amazing journey. Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of People Behind the Science. I am delighted to be here today with Dr. Don Basley. So great to chat with you today Don. How's everything going? Going very well. Thank you. Now that we have a good connection. We had a little bit of technical difficulty but we've got everything sorted out. Listeners, I am excited to introduce you today Don. She is a professor of biology and the former director of the Institute for Research, Innovation and Sustainability at York University. She received a master's degree in botany from the University of Toronto and her PhD in Zoology from Oxford University. Afterwards, she completed an Ernest Cook Research Fellowship at Somerville College at the University of Oxford and a Travelyn Research Fellowship at Selwyn College at the University of Cambridge before joining the faculty there at York. Now Don is here with us today to tell us all about her journey through life and science. So today Don, we are thrilled to get to know you, both as a scientist but also as a person. So can you take a few minutes to tell us what you like to do when you're not doing science? That's a question to which I think I probably would have to say I am a plant ecologist and I'm a plant geek. So when I'm not doing measurements for plants, I'm gardening, I'm preserving, I've gotten a lot recently into making jam and pickles and things like that. So a lot of what I do tends to really revolve around plants, even the artists that I know and support tend to be illustrators of wildlife in general and often botany. So that sounds a really bit worrying but makes me seem a bit one-dimensional. So I'm trying to think of what else I do. I read a lot. I'm also a big reader and detective novel of science fiction and I just like to learn different stuff every day and I do like to talk to people and find out what they're doing. Yeah, I guess social life, a lot of my former students now have children and I keep in touch with a lot of them. So a lot of family stuff I guess. Certainly, well done. It is great to hear a little bit more about how you like to spend your time and I think it is perfectly okay to be very passionate about plants inside and outside the lab. I love to hear they're able to spend some time gardening and enjoying the wonderful art of plants. Now can you tell us a little bit about, you mentioned you love to read? Is there a book that you would really recommend that we check out that you've read and just really enjoyed? Well, I've got a lot of books. So I've actually, I'm going to sneak two on. Sure. And this has to really do with my work in sustainability in the last seven to eight years where I got to be part of this interdisciplinary research institute which really moves beyond science and I got into science policy and politics. So my top two reads would be, Naomi Arenski's Merchants of Doubt. She is a professor of the history of science in California and she's written this wonderful, wonderful book about Link Between the Scientist who were lobbying in Washington, DC against the idea that cigarette smoking caused cancer. They were being paid to debunk the data and she draws links between them and the lobby that is all about putting doubt into the public's mind about the science of climate change and she's just a wonderful, wonderful writer. And then there is actually a recent publication by Canadian journalist Chris Pernitz called the War on Science and it sort of documents what's been going on in Canada with respect to the muddling of federal government scientists. So that sort of science, policy and politics stuff and they sort of cover similar territory. I actually read so many detective novels starting from the age of about seven. I read my first time at the Christie and I just devoured everything for the next 30 years and I sort of stopped reading mysteries probably about 15 years ago but while I was on sabbatical a couple of years ago I discovered this amazing French writer whose name is Fred Vargas and she's actually a French archaeologist by Dave and she has a whole series of novels which are set in Paris and they're very quirky and they've been translated into English in the last few years. So anything by Fred Vargas I would say if you like detective novels give it a whirl I think we're going to probably see TV shows from those novels in the same way that we've seen all the great Scandinavian mystery writers like Henning Mankel and all and the girl with the dragon tattoo that series because those were all translated into English. There's so much that is not written in English that will eventually come across and our lives will be more interesting for it. So that's a good one but I have lots of other, I mean my bedside table is stacked with unread books and I actually admit this to people so I may as well get full disclosure out here. I have read a couple of Malcolm Gladwell books front to back covered cover but these tastes were less I often read the review and I like to say professors do read Wikipedia pages when we have to catch up with things. Get the quick sort of cliff notes on it. Well you know John McCarrie I read all of his books years ago about the spine novels about the Cold War and there was that great movie that came out from his first book. I came in from the cold I think that series with a bunch of quite well-known British chapters two or three years ago and it was so complicated the plot was so complex that before we went to see it I was visiting a friend and a colleague and half a person who had the Wikipedia entry because I couldn't remember the plot because they were just too complicated. Certainly I will not deny that I also use Wikipedia liberally so go great to hear about your passion for reading so I'm going to put all these recommendations out there on our resources tab so our listeners can enjoy them as well and I myself love a good mystery novel as well. Agatha Christie brilliance so I'm going to have to check out this new French writer that you've mentioned. Dude if you're a mystery fan absolutely it was then that I stayed with in Oxford who actually knew when I was a grad student and now they both retired but one was an academic and one was a scientist for the government he was actually the top philosophy collegeist for the British government and I stayed with them for the four months that I was back in Oxford in my whole department in my old building not in the same office that was creepy 25 years saying the same building hadn't changed it was still really ugly it's the one you're building in Oxford it's very modern 60s, brutally starked sector but these people are incredible fans truly in key for really big readers themselves and I just said well I don't read mystery novels anymore what should I be reading and you know just gave me these recommendations and they had the book so it was hard for me to get away from their house to my office and the lab because I was like reading these new books and really on fire from this Fred Vargas in particular well great recommendations and great to hear about your life outside of science right some of these things that you're passionate about now I love it but we are going to dive into this scientific side next unearth your other passion in this world plants can you tell us how you describe what you do to someone who's not in science right so here's what I say I say I'm an ecologist and I count different kinds of things like plants and animals and I try to figure out whether the number of organisms are for particular species like in a population going up going down or staying the same and why that is people look at me they go whoa and then I say come and come and think about it what do you actually do as an ecologist you count stuff and I've asked a lot of people to define ecology I often do talks in high schools and grade schools in Ontario in the Toronto region so I'll ask the students to write on a little piece of paper what they think ecology is and they all pretty much write out this very sort of standard textbook definition that would say ecology is research about the way that plants and animals interact with their environment and for me very very passive because if you then say okay so how do we do that what does that mean because science is about action and doing stuff it's also a lot about math and statistics and I think that a lot of people love to watch nature programs on the television about animals in Africa or endangered species or whatever or monoc migration and it's all so wonderful and it looks so glamorous or people who want to be a marine biologist they've watched a lot of Jacques Cousteau and you know I say well okay what do you think they're really doing well they're counting things and if so it sounds so simple how do you count a field population or how do you count a salmon population or how do you count a fungus which could be this massive clonal organism so I'd like to say we count things and we try to figure out why the numbers are changing or even what the numbers are is so hard and I think people can then wrap their brain around that and it ties it back to the mathematics and statistics of it that you're dealing with numbers. So certainly well having spent my fair amount of hours at a de-section scope counting zooplankton I understand this counting aspect while it sounds easy it's certainly quite the task and really a fascinating area of research to study there in ecology so amazing questions that you're answering it's a really great point that you brought up about your daily life as a scientist so can you tell us with all these things that you're trying to get done in a day and is there a particular motivational quote that really resonates with you something you keep in your mind to keep you motivated and focused each day. Well of course being me and you know being slightly on the obsessive side of things I always say to people one of my favorite TV shows is Mr. Monk the obsessive compulsive detective but you know what scientists have to have a certain piece of that because we have to pay attention to detail and they have to be really precise so naturally I'm going to tell you I have lots of favorite quotes and they change by the months and the week and I actually follow a lot of Twitter accounts who do these motivational quotes because I think they're really fun so I actually have in front of me on my desk as we're talking a book that I picked up when I went to Philadelphia to give a talk at 10 a few years ago and I went to the Liberty Bell and I bought a book of Benjamin Franklin quotes so I would say without giving any Franklin quotes that he's good for a lot of quotes because that was kind of how I gather he made money with by being a publisher and the printer of P.T. quotes so I have some and I just love to dip into Ben Franklin but a lot of stories when I was teaching classicalogy I used to quote for the students I was trying to motivate them to show up in class. Could you just like post everything on the mood or electronic class through you know do podcasts of your lectures and then we don't have to come and I was like oh my gosh you really have to come so I found this great quote which is the world is run by people who show up and that is attributed to an engineering guy called Robert Johnson so that's a really good one and then I like Winston Churchill quote that I kept on as a text message on my phone one time about 10 years ago our local cell phone provider was trying to monetize text messages so you could pay for this service I had it for free for a bit and they would send you a daily inspirational quote. I kept this one for years and it says success is the ability to go from one failure to another without any loss of enthusiasm so that's Winston Churchill and I think that really describes science because so much of what we do I'm probably going to fail and then here's a good one from Albert Einstein if you can't explain it to a six-year-old then you don't understand it so the idea that we have to make things really really clear and there's a variant of that attributed to Richard Steinman and one more favorite because I do love quotes and my colleagues in the law school say wow you know what is it with you and these quotes and I say wow you know there's a cradle of truth in them they may be quite there's a term they use I can't think what it is boring or well whatever is simplistic but Albert Einstein definitely said look deep deep into nature and then you will understand everything better I like it I'm not a good one yeah you have so many fantastic quotes there I think I really love that one about if you're not able to explain it to a six-year-old you don't really understand it and I think that ties in well with what you're describing you know talking to students about tell me what ecology is or what you think ecology is you know they're espousing some textbook definition that really insinuates they don't really understand it all these quotes have great applications for science well don it is great to hear about these quotes that inspire you and push you forward every day now can you think back along your journey as a scientist and tell us about some of these people who really stick out in your mind as people who inspire you or maybe serve as role models for you so I've got one role model that if I had to pick one because you know I'm sort of peppering this conversation already with sneaking in more than one answer you know what I was that student who wrote the exam till the very last second and you brought your own extra pages yeah yeah you know I was that person so I'm very sympathetic with students who say one more minute one more minute anyway so my top pick for a role model though I will talk a little bit I hope about being a nine-year-old in London and going to the natural history museum and being really excited about the African dioramas but my main role model and mentor who continues to be an important person in my life is a woman called Judy or Judith Myers and she is at 70 the current president of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution she is a professor emeritus so retired professor at the University of British Columbia in those duology department and I first met Judy when she was on sabbatical in Oxford in 1986 I guess with her family and her husband they had come with their young children to Oxford and I got to hang out a lot with her so gosh now we're talking 30 years she does research in biological control and we were interested in anti-herival defenses in plants so if a plant can't run away from being eaten it's got to sit there and take it but what can it do you know it can evolve some deterrents and she said to me one day she said hey do you want to write a book couldn't he I have a contract I'm writing a book on biological control plant animal interactions with Cambridge University Press I was like oh my gosh I'm just a graduate student and this professor is asking me if I want to go over a book because we planned and did some experiments together that were a sidebar to my doctoral research and that book finally came out in 2003 it took us 17 years to write it's quite well respected in the field because it turned out being a lot about invasive non-indigenous or introduced plant species or ecology and management and so she continues to be just a huge role model certainly well done that sounds like you had a fantastic mentor and someone to really look up to as a role model and what an incredible opportunity to be able to co-author this book with her that sounds like a fantastic and maybe daunting opportunity especially at that stage in your career but that is amazing and just challenging but I mean I think science is really about being generous with your colleagues and the younger people and I'm trying to emulate that now so that's something I really take with me well that is wonderful and now you mentioned a little bit about this nine-year-old you being excited to explore museums and learn about science can you tell us where your interest in science began and hit some of these key moments along your journey that really got you to where you are today right so I just finished teaching a field biology course at York University which is the Toronto area ranked as about the third largest most dense urban congregation in North America people are shocked when they come here they think Canada I mean people in the United States think oh it's really green in those nature and they come to southern Ontario so 90 percent of the Canadian population lives within about 100 miles of the Canada U.S. border and a big chunk of that population lives in southern Ontario down between here and Windsor Detroit or between here and Niagara Buffalo extending to the northeast up to Ottawa and Montreal it's a really urban area so I just taught this field course that was really designed for our biology students who are really quite urban in their outlook to get out and do ecology and people say to me wow well you've done field work in New York to can really remote places and I go yeah and you know I grew up in London I am from southern urban person right nature is everywhere like life is everywhere and you can have an interest you don't have to be in some cool place in Africa going there on safari as a kid to get into this so I had this wonderful young substitute teacher from Kenya when I was like 9 or 10 going to school and he took us on a class school trip to the natural history museum in Kensington and I can remember all the projects that we did we looked at the African animal dioramas I've only been to Africa once since that time and I just remember thinking I wanted to be a biologist and study things in Africa well that never really happened right it did really feed my interest in biology and I used to have these ID guides and I identify my local plants and birds like we're talking in London right but we had parks and you know looking back on it when I go back and do I can identify every species there now and I'm like wow this is just total weedy for I would sparrows and starlings but heck you know they do behavior and you can watch them and they're doing interesting things that relate to the theory of ecology so my parents then emigrated to Canada in the early 1970s and I did three years of high school here and I was a total nerd I apparently my students tell me there is a difference between a doorknobunnerd so I'm probably both I'm not quite sure that I belong to the math club at my school in the suburbs of Toronto and when you look at my high school yearbook they say things like my ambition is to go to Oxford University but I'll probably end up being the box sidekick and stuff like that so you think well okay and I went to a lot of all-girl schools and I think for me that was really important you had strong role models who are women everywhere I was taught by nuns I went to a private convent school in Ontario and they were teaching me all this science you know it was just great weirdly though and again people are a bit shocked when I tell them this I say you know what biology was my worst subject really well I'm shocked too I am not by a critic it's physics chemistry math history even that were more factual in terms of the testing or you could just solve a problem it was easier to get top grades in those but I just loved biology and I think in a way I'm a bit perverse I think this does speak to the fundamental nature of scientists is like you just have to love looting and just keep on going and I was like I can lick this biology thing I can just get great because look I'm doing so well I mean his other courses so anyway so after that I did carry on in biology I gave up very quickly most parents who aren't working in the field of biology my dad is an engineer and my mom is a sort of bookkeeper secretary although she was a nurse for about two minutes but she never really practiced they thought well if you're interested in biology then you must be going to be a doctor and I don't like blood I couldn't do the thesis but I kind of gave that up three weeks into undergraduate and then also at the University of Toronto there were these massive massive undergraduate classes so I went from a really tiny private school of maybe six or seven people in my chemistry class in grade 13 because at that time we had grade 13 in Ontario it's in in dropped and we finished at grade 12 like the rest of North America and then go on to university so you know I really was shocked by the size of these classes I was shocked by having boys in my classes is back in the 70s they were just nakedly ambitious it was like people were saying well I'm going to med school and you know you would go to you're probably too young to remember this but you know we'd have assignments and you'd have to go to read a journal article deep in the bowels of the medical sciences library for you remember I don't know if you ever happened to you most of the stuff was online by the time I got to that point so I got lucky and those were the days you know when you had to go and actually remove the journal volume photocopier yeah and then photocopier or whatever you know and these days you just rip out your ipad your iphone and take photographs of anything that you want to record you know you digitize it you do OCR recognition it so easy but you go to look in the journal science or nature say and you look for the pages of this article and they be missing you think that's really weird the way my article and somebody would have taken razor and razed out that article from the bound volume because they were probably trying to get in a medical school and they needed an A plus and this was a really good way to whack the competition down I don't know if you've ever heard these stories but it really is true and it did happen so I thought well I don't really like the sight of blood I'm not good with dissection so I'm a bit creeped out by some maybe medical school isn't for me what can I do they were launching at the time biogeography major and environmental studies minor that you could do combined with physical geography and botany and I just took it from there and again I got this generous offer from a professor who taught me plant morphology Bob Jeffries I was sort of hanging around after his class in plant ecology or something saying is there any way I can like do some kind of work in your lab and he said oh well I'm looking for a field assistant for my master's student to do field work in northern Manitoba on the tundra do you want it go do you want to do it oh wow I don't think this happens today I really don't think that today but there's a new NSERC summer undergraduate research award that will like pay you to go up there I was like oh yeah I pretty good grades I'll apply and I got one I was the first cohort thank goodness my parents had no idea what I was going to wandering around in the tundra we're done you know because they were on the bears oh my gosh we had to have rightful practice because they were like eating our experiments and walking into the camp and stuff and I ended up spending five summers I worked there as a field assistant I did my masters there I learned how to cook meals for field crews of 30 people coming into band the snow dees populations and help with helicopters and everything being in a field in that kind of situation in a field camp is really I think for a lot of people a transformative experience and I just found that I loved to be outside in the middle of nowhere off the grid counting plant needs you know and it was really a mix of that Indiana Jones kind of feeling with this going science right an experiments and field-based experiments and I remember coming out of the field camp coming down to Toronto to the very very hot muggy weather in about 1982 or 81 and in fact Raiders of the Lost Ark was released and that was the first thing that we did a bunch of us met up so we went to see this film and we were like wow our life is a little bit like that yeah not quite but you can relate to it but you know you kind of felt that there was a glamorous fight to being a field biologist yeah that was cool and then after that what did I do I had a master in botany and a guy if you listen to this podcast he'll be absolutely horrified so this guy called John Krebs was on sabbatical in University of Toronto and he came to our lab but he was writing a book on optimal foraging theory for Princeton University Krebs and he was looking for the literature on grazing ecology and those were the days you know when you used to write out your references on this profile carbs and I had hundreds of them because I was really interested in the literature you know you can probably tell from this conversation but I would like just go wow if there's two research journal papers on goose grazing there's probably 15 and I'm going to find them right dig them all out and I did and then we talked and we talked about the fact that in this very famous long term research project on the impact of these letters snow geese on the vegetation of these salt marshes on the Hudson Bay and there's massive work being done on the genetics of the color fades is the blue geese the white geese it's a tremendously famous study not just in North America but globally he said you know what about the behavior what about the choice the selection of the geese and I said oh I don't know anything about that but they're manipulating the vegetation in such a way and nitrogen is involved and of course carbivoles need nitrogen they're very limited they're not carnivores it's a different nutrient proposition so he said well maybe you could consider doing a PhD with me on diet choices in grazers because you're working on these geese so I applied for scholarships got one and I went and did my doctorate on sheep grazing in the Ornithology Institute in Oxford interesting and John Krebs just to let you know if case you don't know who John Krebs is he's now Lord Krebs he was the chief science advisor he headed up two or three major research councils the agriculture and food council for the United Kingdom government he's the head of an Oxford College he's really famous and his dad was Sir Hans Krebs who got the Nobel Prize for the Krebs Michael so there I am going here is this John Krebs you know because I'm you know he's got this and then I discovered that I'm doing a doctorate with this and he's a pharmacist and he's a pharmacist and I guess that it provides us for anyone listening I think it's really important to note that at my master's level and my doctoral level those of those men who turned out to be my supervisors with whom I still enjoy close relationships in the case of Jeffries he actually died a few years ago and I'm very close with his widow and organized the conference to celebrate his life and legacy and he and I said baby said it daughters and I just we were all on holiday two weeks ago so either like lifelong friendships that get made they didn't push me into that they both asked me to explore other opportunities so I actually also got accepted to a master's program at York University where I'm now a professor to do biogeography in Belize and I decided that the choice between polar bears and snakes in swamps I was just going to do the polar bears yep you're going to be in the field so I'm really someone who is enamored of tropical biology but terrified of doing fieldwork there but I just love it I just love everything about the tropics while doing nothing really as an expert and then for John Krebs and Oxford I also was accepted to a PhD program at McQuarrie University in Australia to work with a wonderful wonderful ecologist called Mark Westby on grazing in rangelands, dry land system and the reason I went to England was actually because I'd grown up there and I was too scared of going that far to Australia leaving everything behind certainly staying in a comfort zone did actually play a role in those choices but nevertheless I created the opportunity to do other things and that was advice from both of them is to look for other opportunities and I say that to all the students is I say open doors you know don't shut off keep those doors open and then you have a choice and then there may be reasons that may be about being in your comfort zone but at least try and give yourself a jumping off point to jump out of your comfort zone right right right back certainly well those sound like incredible opportunities and it sounds like you have just had an amazing journey through science to get to where you are today now can you tell us a little bit more about where you are today one of these projects that you're working on that you are thrilled to be a part of I have always had a lot of diverse interests my main area of scientific expertise is plant animal interactions although that has sort of dimensions of plant defenses animal behavior working on invasive species and then I have this other dimension of being involved in sustainability and science policy but my current thing that I'm pretty excited about was actually all over the media recently we work on grasses just common all garden lawn grasses and it turns out that about 30 years ago it was discovered that a lot of them have got a systemic microscopic fungus that lives inside which is a third party in a grass animal grazer interaction which can synthesize toxic alkaloids to provide the host grass with an anti herbivore defense and we recently had a paper published in biology letters with myself and two of my former students and it showed that here is the kicker move it actually when it supplied directly to this fungus that normally lives inside a grass actually slowed its growth down and lowers the alkaloid toxicity of the host grass so the idea that there may be a fungus hiding inside the grass which very rarely comes in direct contact for an interaction with the grazer we've shown that that's probably not true but we don't know that there's a mystery ingredient in the moose and reindeer saliva which can act as a detoxification agent so that's kind of a really cool fungal endophytes are such a fantastic sister study and actually another really famous biologist Phil Hamilton who is famous for his work on eus social insects and inclusive fitness he's the one that got me onto that in a chance conversation in Oxford he said why don't you study these fungi growing in these grasses aren't you studying grasses eaten by sheep and I just heard about this I was like oh no something else but it's amazing to lose it's fantastic and we're still doing lots of stuff in that area well that is a fascinating project interesting to hear almost it sounds like this evolutionary arms race you know the moose are responding to this fungi being introduced now into the grass and sort of developing their own way to counter attack it's absolutely an evolutionary arms race and you know I'm going to have to speak to some evolutionary biologists about this because really you know as an ecologist I'm really documenting this and working on proximate kind of explanations as opposed to the ultimate ones but it fits right in with that certainly well that is a fascinating project and it's been great to hear this amazing story about your journey through science and how you got to where you are today and we've talked about some of the struggles even countered along the way some of these main decision points or pivot points and I think every scientist can look back on their career and there are certain periods that are maybe a little less rosy than the others times where you were struggling or maybe you had major failures can you take us back to one of these times Don and tell us what happened and how you worked through one of these difficult times I think it's difficult so I'm a female scientist coming from a time in the seventies and eighties when there were lots and lots of women with me in my classes but when my look around now I'm still often one of the few women in the room particularly senior women and so as you know it's this whole leaky pipeline where there's a big resurgence of interest today in getting women in science technology engineering and mathematics and I have two daughters so particularly interested in making sure that if they want to have science careers that they are strong women in terms of dealing with how competitive it is competitive and I think it can be very discouraging and we now know there's so much new research on the complex social drivers that cause women to drop out talented talented women and I've certainly hit various roadblocks along the way so I actually wrote about 10 or 12 years ago an article in the university affairs national higher education newspaper for Canada which is like the chronicles in the state so that was all about getting a life coach you know dealing with two young children and I look back on that it was a great article I mean I still read it to get inspiration from me I'm like wow and I've moved on a lot from dealing with young kids and losing my research grants you know and I'll just say that losing my insert which I had for like 15-16 years which is the major funding grant was actually very empowering because it happened just before I went to be director of the sustainability research institute and it sort of freed me up to have lots of other research grants from different federal funding bodies you know so I actually could have chosen to really stay on this pathway of being just a sort of everyday biology professor but I'd always been very interested in other areas and policy and sustainability and so on so in many ways I use those failures to just take away the obligations that are associated with being a publisher of parish scientist and I published in crazy places so my most recent failure which has come good have to do with turning to the textbook market I had never published with a commercial publisher and about two years ago I was contacted by one of Canada's top ecology professors Bill Friedman at Dalhalsie and he had published major ecology texts a few years ago and they were going to a second edition and they had been criticized the writing team and the publisher because first of all the physiological ecology chapter was only about animals there was no plant physiological ecology. Interesting. It was completely awesome and second of all they had all these cool boxes it was called ecology a Canadian context and it was fantastic in that it sort of really was aimed at the Canadian University student population in ecology and to say here's all these case studies that are based in Canada and then they also featured famous Canadian ecologist that there were only two out of sixteen were women so they had a bit of criticism for that so they asked me to come on board and I said what the heck you know I'm coming off being this director and I like to do new things here's a new challenge I've never done this before I learned something new I think we're detecting a pattern here is I just like to try new things right say that so I jumped on board I kept saying how I normally bob Jeffries he would have written this might now defeat more often supervisors so okay I don't care I'll do it but he would have been a lot better person so I went in and it honestly has been the most difficult writing experience since I did my doctorate probably oh really really difficult so everyone remembers doing all nighters to finish assignments when you're an undergraduate and even a graduate student stay up all night I hadn't pulled this many all nighters for about 15 to 20 years I worked with a second edition I was joining an existing writing team I was becoming co-author on the chapter on physiological ecology with a delightful professor and I didn't want to insult him he was having to give up pages and cut his section down they had a vision for the book Bill Friedman is a very prolific writer of books as well scientist he's amazing and I was like okay I can work with the team I can do this I can fit in with what you're doing and I wrote about 70 or 80 pages of my contribution and it was entirely rejected oh no they just felt it didn't fit with the flow so it was like back to the drawing board and it was fascinating and then we dealt with the actual editors on the ground who had published the book in India there's such an enormous difference between a commercially based textbook which makes people money you know if it sells and it's a very competitive market as you know and then publishing the odd book for routledge or came regionally or print oh my gosh it was so hard but I was really mentored by my colleague in the department who is a plant physiologist he let me come sit in his lab he pulled down every textbook in plant physiology I revisited all this stuff I learned as an undergraduate it was put it this way so much more work than I anticipated and it was really a headache but the textbook is out and I'm really proud that my name is Tak Tomi and I'm like whoa and you'll see it on Twitter you'll see that's my pen tweet good to know I never really have chatted with people about their experiences writing chapters for textbook so great to hear how it went for you and maybe you know maybe it's better to be in that first edition sort of getting in at the ground floor other than trying to join later and trying to make everything that you're writing fit in with what's already there things like that so very interesting insights there like hard and I dealt with professional science editors and illustrators and I also learned a lot about copyright so there were lots of figures that we wanted and of course these days with digital photography I was able to generate a lot of those figures myself from my garden to illustrate, turgid and leaves and leaves that were flagging and wilting through not being watered that kind of thing but it turned out that I want to do the figure so I'm going to put this in here because this is a thing that nobody ever thinks of I wanted to figure from a really famous paper on plant defenses from science and it probably cost them three or four thousand dollars just to have that oh my gosh at every stage we were talking about intellectual property and copyright ownership it was so fascinating very interesting well it sounds like you have had some great experiences and I love chatting about your personality almost of going out there wanting to try new things and certainly turning some of these failures turning some of these challenges into opportunities are really taking that viewpoint of seeing them as opportunities rather than sort of crying about them and retreating I think that is a great trait to have for a successful scientist and we don't just want to talk about these tough times can you tell us next Dawn about another one of these success stories coming from your laboratory maybe a recent one that's meant a lot to you in addition to this book coming out right oh gosh so when it comes to statistics I have learned a pile of statistics packages from sass to sista to sbap you and now all the cool kids are doing our stats which is open source statistics packages and I've said to my students oh gosh do I really need to learn something else right I took a course at this genome to buy whose conference the R stats use a group at Miguel University mounted a one day course and it was packed with 70 or 80 people including all these great professors like me who are dealing with learning stats with R stats and they made a comment they said we're so happy to see so many older people here I actually took a course so that with the personal science success because I will now be aiming to switch over to our stats and then back in June I was asked to be on a live panel road show from Canada CDC radios cracks and cracks you might have heard of it it's the final yeah so NPR has its science shows and cracks and cracks at CDC and they dealt with the big questions of science things like where did all the anti-matto go and my question was why does biodiversity matter and I had to explain it in five minutes so I'm loving that I can wither on with you I'll give you way more than five minutes yeah for our minute to explain why does biodiversity matter and that was listened to by a lot of people on Twitter and we were tweeting and saying hey it would appear if you listened to my answer and tell me if you agree with the research that I quoted and people actually said they thought I did a good job so that was a different kind of peer review absolutely well those are too incredible and I think non-traditional successes that not a lot of people chat about and I think especially with the technology changes you know thinking about all these statistical packages that you've moved through over the years now learning our you know I've dabbled in our myself it can be quite complex depending on what you're trying to do I think that is a great success and certainly having this amazing opportunity slash challenge I think to describe in five minutes why biodiversity matters amazing success that you were able to pull that off maybe the sort of pressure that they're quite similar to publishing actually because you're defending a point of view and data it's a different way of putting the information out there I mean I would say I got denominated for awards and you know I'm also bit bored by the whole award thing I like to nominate other people for awards at this stage like Korea try and get other people science awards certainly well that is fantastic great to hear you're paying it forward getting some other folks nominated yeah absolutely you have to because every time I go on Google Scholar and you look at standing on the shoulders of giants and really so much about science is being a good collaborator absolutely well great to hear about these success stories and how you help other people achieve success as well and I know we've chatted about so many incredible aspects about careers in science and I think even hinted at some of these opportunities that you've had to travel and see the world and share your science can you think back on all of these travel experiences that you've had Don and tell us about your favorite I did come up with only one it's a challenge I thought a lot about this well first of all the main reason for being a field biologist is to see the world I think any field ecologist who doesn't admit that it's not full disclosure and the main reason for being an academic a research field biologist is I don't have to dress up for work you know you can just go in really comfortable clothes so having said that I worked that to the max and for me the coolest place that I have ever been to and done research is St. Kilda which is an archipelago of islands in the Atlantic ocean it's the western most part of Britain and it's the wetest and windiest place in Britain and that was where I did research on the so-a sheep these tiny fell sheep which is an abandoned population because people except for the British army don't live there anymore it's actually an army host I don't even know what's happening with it now I think they've closed it down but they had a radar station which used to track rockets that were fired across the Atlantic it was a missile tracking and also a UNESCO world heritage site with this unbelievable archaeological history and it's been written about in books with titles like The Island at the edge of the world and I did actually in July one year there about just over 20 years ago I got exposure in July doing fieldwork something the pop population oh my goodness so it's got to be the most spectacular place that I've spent a long period of time in and it's possible for anyone to get there you can join on to various tours take your seasickness hills with you oh my goodness I never been seasick until I crossed this and killed it in a fishing boat wow well done I think you've convinced me not to go but I'll just live my carelessly through your experience I tend to be prone to seasickness myself yeah it's really a horrible feeling I never known you know you've gone ferries and things it's nice and flat and calm and yeah yeah or a big ship a big liner crossing the Atlantic even I did that a few years ago on a big ocean liner you don't feel it well that sounds incredible though being on really such an isolated and it sounds like undisturbed relatively environment being able to admire all the sheep out there I'm sure they're having a fantastic time freezing out there in the cold yeah they little brown sheep they're sort of sunny domesticated they have brown wool and they're really little and they don't look like sheep's tool they're like a rare breed and of course the sea birds are amazing both puffins everywhere and so it's really famous for the sea bird colonies well it sounds beautiful I'm gonna have to observe pictures I think and I think you're absolutely right I think a lot of the draw for biologists for people doing fieldwork people doing ecology is opportunities to travel to see the world to go where the science is and study these fascinating systems in different lands I think that is an incredible incredible perk or opportunity that you get working in these types of fields so great to hear about your memorable experience there it's a privilege certainly and I think one of the other privileges is some of these incredible people that you have an opportunity to work with over the years and through different research groups I think you get a lot of quirky traditions that you can remember or even funny memories that pop up in your mind that you can laugh about even years later so can you share one of these people focused memories or traditions that you can recall well we're building a digital archive at the moment open access about these long term studies in Churchill in and around Churchill on the snow geese and associated research and so people who are now retiring have been sending us their code of chrome slides which when I show under graduates a code of chrome slide they go what's that and then I explain how we used to have slide carousels remember the carousel absolutely and if you got them out of order it was just such a pain and sometimes they would fall out and from the slide would fall on the floor and you know all these things that just never happen anymore so recently we were looking through and we scan them and we create the metadata and it reminded me that when I worked in this field camp you know where polar bears used to eat my experiments and stuff we had an outhouse and it had a bucket in it which was a cut down sort of like a diesel barrel and the worst job in the camp everyone really used to be very organized and pulled together but the worst job was to empty the outhouse bucket and then local festival that was quite far away and you know we used to draw cards they used to deal cards and if you've got the black aces then you would the person two of you would have to do this job so we were looking through slides and I saw this image and my students were saying what are those people doing why is that even in here oh my goodness oh yes cap life so that was all those fun memories remembering that it was very very funny and the good friend who is a professor of forestry she did her PhD there but she's a forestry prof she runs up mountains all the time even there are six days her name is Kathy Martin and she for some reason would always be pulling these black aces just more often than others in order to try and minimize her chances of getting it when this whole ceremony was happening everyone would come together and they'd deal these cards and you'd turn over your cards and see who got it Kathy would do things like put on oven mitts or get barbecue tongs to put her to chew so well have other people do so because she always would get them and we had a bunkhouse where a lot of people would sleep and you know Kathy she had these wonderful dogs which would find the tarnigan nest so she was working on a kind of grouse called a willow tarnigan and one of her dogs Tasha who I have made sure is in this digital archive who is an English setter at one point they banned me from going outside the bunkhouse without my glasses because these dogs these English setters that were working dogs were white in color and I went out one day to brush my teeth in the river you know you just dip it in the river there's anything up on Hudson Bay it's really clean water there's no GRD or Biva Thiva and I could see in the corner of my eye this white thing and I thought oh yeah well that's just the dog must have come out of the hut when I came out because I was up really early and so I could see the sun the distance moving somewhere paying no attention half asleep I go back in the concert hut and I look in the dog's sleeping boxes where they would sleep by the beds and I'm like oh that's funny that's too toxic here what's that white thing so I put my glasses off and went outside it with like a young polar bear oh good nice walk onto that we're like oh get the horn you know get the firecrackers after that they said you must always lay your glasses yeah just strap them to your head not take them off that is amazing I was going to ask you how do you ever see a polar bear up there so the answer is sort of I guess often often a lot yeah because we were right there on that main route and we've been back and my mum even came up after 35 years she finally ascending me care packages when we did this conference a few years ago my mum who is now in her late seventies came up and she said to me I actually did see a polar bear at Fort Churchill oh dear and she didn't manage to get lost I do not have her sense of direction I really don't like no where I am and we were like mom don't get lost because their polar bears wondering correct and she said oh I can really understand now 30 years later why you loved coming here for so many summers she saw the tundra and the coastal marshes and she said this is really amazing so that was pretty cool to get my mum who is totally urban to see that that sounds like an incredible experience and just some amazing memories being out there working on the tundra these close encounters with polar bears that is fascinating and sounds like a great adventure and I'm seeing where the Indiana Jones resemblance comes in here I know we've tested so much about these memories that you've had and even some of these incredible research projects they are able to work on we haven't yet touched on some of these dream projects some of these big questions that you have burning in a rind that you would love to answer but maybe there's something in the way things like funding or staff or technology or feasibility that are limiting you right now so can you tell me don't if we took all of those restrictions away what is one research question that you are just dying to know the answer to right so I think it goes back to these fungi these fungal endophytes that are living inside so many common grasses that are spread worldwide and the question outside of the agricultural impacts of these alkaloids which are really quite vast and very intensely studied in the source of concern certainly in the US southern and southeast and parts Kentucky and so on it would be whether the ecological question of the extent to which fungal endophytes of grasses that grazed by herbivores really are regulating those populations so bringing it back to that fundamental ecology question of whether populations in different places of grazing animals are what's determining their numbers and their distribution and I think we've made a lot of progress in the last 20 years in the study of fungal endophytes and the alkaloids that they synthesize and the grass host of the fungus clearly sometimes the grass host is getting an obvious benefit so this is a symbiotic mutualistic relationship but in other cases it really looks like the fungus living in the grasses acting more as a parasite it's really costly for the graft to host it and I think there's so much more that needs to be looked at in this area and these sort of complex interactions in ecology where you've got three players from three quite different taxonomic groups in this case of fungus a plant and a grazing animal herbivore of some kind to me those kinds of questions are still really open because they're so interdisciplinary and they're so multidimensional so that continues to be a big area of interest I've always kept it up but I'm going back into it more intensely with Mark Fikari with one of the authors of that Moose Spit paper we're doing that right now well that is an intriguing relationship to explore really diving into these details of what is going on between the fungi and the grass and I really like this description of sort of the balance where sometimes it seems almost parasitic and sometimes it seems very beneficial very symbionics so very interesting and hopefully we'll be able to get some of those answers soon the big point of debate in the literature you know it's quite hot and rightly so rightly so certainly well fascinating research questions for us to sink our teeth in and ponder with you and I think over your years as a scientist you have a lot of opportunities to work with amazing collaborators work with amazing mentors and you get a lot of great advice along the way can you share with us today what you would consider just the best piece of advice you've ever received wow yes the one thing I would recommend to everybody in science is to get a hold of a wonderful manual from the National Institutes of Health it's about best practices and ethics for young researchers working in the team conditions and I actually heard one of the authors who is an ethicist he's an ethics professor philosophy professor and he is somebody who mediates conflicts for these multi-million dollar grants at NIH so you'll get like 40 authors and 15 PIs and I think learning how to deal with the human nature piece of science which is sometimes things go along swimmingly well so much trust in what we do we have to be trusting our colleagues but there are egos involved and there will be everything from authorship conflicts to personality differences the skill set that you need to have to navigate that isn't I think just one that people are born with you have to work on it you know there's hilarious of research in business schools on ethics and organizational behavior and there's so much learning to be had so the name of this guide is collaboration and team science a field guide by Michelle Bennett Howard Gadlin and Samantha Levine Finley from the National Institutes of Health and it covers everything from thinking about team science preparing yourself building a research team fostering trust communicating about science sharing recognition and credit handling conflict I've had to learn so much of this stuff just on the fly I would have loved it if there was something like this when I was starting out that would be that sounds like an amazing resource though I think that is so right that a lot of these almost soft skills a lot of these sort of research ethics and even people skills are not something that really is developed in the science curriculum at most places you know it's not something where you even realize that there are going to be these issues when you're going into it until you're sort of already in the middle of it trying to figure out how to navigate it so great resource to recommend for our listeners to check out who might be scientists who might be going through sticky situations themselves working in different teams so fantastic advice now is there any other last piece of advice or last piece of inspiration Dawn that you want to share with our listeners today coming from you now personally I think that it would be for me personally one of the things that I did that was really important when I had tenure already but I had a young family and I was very stressed out at work and I actually got a career coach for a while back 15 years ago and I think that these days I see so many young people undergraduates and graduate students who are struggling with being anxious and these things are like imposter syndrome and so on and so forth that you read about and I would say yet professional I think the least that's a really good thing to do and then diversify your mentors I haven't had one mentor I've had many many mentors and these days I am mentored in some ways by my former students who are like half my age you know so you can learn from everybody so that's really important and learn how to overcome failure if something doesn't work just get up and do it again I think I see not just young women who are discouraged but also young men and so many students I'm teaching these days now that I'm back in teaching I'm really seeing this sort of anxiety and I'm a parent myself of two daughters and one of the things that I really try and do is get them to be self-reliant and self-confident by really not doing everything for them and letting them fail I think that at a certain point you learn more from failure than from success so that would be the advice is let yourself fail and it happens to everybody and get some professional coaching and get as many mentors as you can and listen to what they have to say excellent advice Don and I think you touched on so many important points there with that response in terms of finding those mentors making those connections with people who will be able to help you like coaches and certainly diversifying the types of mentors especially if you're not sure what you want to do talk to a lot of different people and get their perspectives and then I love what you're saying here about letting yourself fail and it happens to everybody you just have to pick yourself up dust yourself off clean any lessons that you can and move on so great advice for our listeners now can you tell them how they can reach out to learn more about your your research right so I'm very easy to find on the internet just Google Dawn daisley have a lab website called Dawn daisley lab got your q.ca and I tried to block fairly regularly you know my email in box is a truly scary place but one over the last few years is simply aggregate it all in Google and buy more space I don't even waste time deleting I just search for stuff so what I always say to people is if I have an answer to your email just treat me at the home base you know I try to get back to people as much as I can I'm a terrible procrastinator and the books that you need for that is called Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy that is the book so continuously late and the book for that is called Never Be Late Again my latest blog post actually I talk about you know changing from being a director and a leader at a research institute to just being an everyday biology professor and completely giving up all my scheduling falling behind and failing on my deadlines you know I just feel like everybody just shout at me you know I respond quite well up tonight the squeaky wheel and all that yeah absolutely so Twitter is really good and with the email dbazleyat your q.ca you know what I may be looking at it that day and then again maybe not I'm terrible I got editors across with me you know and I just apologize to everybody all the time but Twitter is really good because it's so short and it's separate from the email so you don't have to dig through to find the important pieces yeah yeah it's like a river I call Twitter is the river never try and swim upstream in Twitter it only flows one way right I like your inbox certainly well fantastic advice for our listeners who are trying to get in touch with you be persistent find you on email find you on Twitter check out your blog all great ways to learn more and don't thank you so much for chatting with me today and sharing all these amazing stories well thank you it's been really fun I don't normally do the story things thank you absolutely I have enjoyed our conversations so much as well and thank you to our listeners out there join us again next time for another episode of people behind the science your voyage to the lives of today's exceptional scientists has just begun you can find everything we talked about today including our guests favorite books biographies photos and more when you visit us at www.peoplebehindtheScience.com I look forward to seeing you next time on People Behind the Science humorapplause
