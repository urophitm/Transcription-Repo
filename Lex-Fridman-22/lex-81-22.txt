 The following is a conversation with Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University, best known for his 1975 book Animal Liberation that makes an ethical case against eating meat. He has written brilliantly from an ethical perspective on extreme poverty, euthanasia, human genetic selection, sports doping, the sale of kidneys, and generally happiness, including in his books Ethics in the Real World and The Life You Can Save. He was a key popularizer of the effective altruism movement and is generally considered one of the most influential philosophers in the world.

It really is the best way to support the podcast and the journey I'm on. As you may know, I primarily eat a ketogenic or carnivore diet, which means that most of my diet is made up of me. I do not hunt the food I eat, though one day I hope to. I love fishing, for example, fishing and eating the fish I catch has always felt much more honest than participating in the supply chain of factory farming. From an ethics perspective, this part of my life has always had a cloud over it. It makes me think. I've tried a few times in my life to reduce the amount of meat I eat, but for some reason, whatever the makeup of my body, whatever the way I practice the dieting I have, I get a lot of mental and physical energy and performance from eating meat. So both intellectually and physically, it's a continued journey for me. I return to Peter's work often to reevaluate the ethics of how I live this aspect of my life. Let me also say that you may be a vegan or you may be a meat eater and maybe upset by the words I say or Peter says, but I ask for this podcast and other episodes of this podcast that you keep an open mind.

When did you first become conscious of the fact that there is much suffering in the world? I think I was conscious of the fact that there's a lot of suffering in the world, pretty much as soon as I was able to understand anything about my family and its background because I lost three of my four grandparents in the Holocaust. Obviously I knew why I only had one grandparent and she herself had been in the camps and survived. So I think I knew a lot about that pretty early. My entire family comes from the Soviet Union. I was born in the Soviet Union. The World War II has deep roots in the culture and the suffering that the war brought. The millions of people who died is in the music, is in the literatures and the culture. What do you think was the impact of the war broadly on our society? The war had many impact. I think one of them, a beneficial impact, is that it showed what racism and authoritarian government can do. At least as far as the West was concerned, I think that meant that I grew up in an era in which there wasn't the kind of overt racism and anti-Semitism that had existed for my parents in Europe. I was growing up in Australia. Certainly that was clearly seen as something completely unacceptable. There was also a fear of a further outbreak of war which this time we expected would be nuclear because of the way the Second World War had ended. So there was this overshadowing of my childhood about the possibility that I would not live to grow up and be an adult because of catastrophic nuclear war. There was a film on the beach made in which the city that I was living Melbourne was the last place on earth to have living human beings because of the nuclear cloud that was spreading from the north. So that certainly gave us a bit of that sense. There were clearly many other legacies that we got of the war as well and the whole setup of the world and the cold war that followed. All of that has its roots in the Second World War. There is much beauty that comes from war. At a conversation with Eric Weinstein, he said everything is great about war except all the death and suffering. Do you think there's something positive that came from the war? The mirror that it put to our society, the ripple effects on it ethically speaking, do you think there are positive aspects to war? I find it hard to see positive aspects in war and some of the things that other people think of as positive and beautiful may be questioning. So there's a certain kind of patriotism people say during wartime we all pull together, we all work together against the common enemy and that's true and outside enemy does unite a country and in general it's good for countries to be united and have common purposes. But it also engenders a kind of a nationalism and a patriotism that can't be questioned and that I'm more skeptical about. What about the brotherhood that people talk about from soldiers? The sort of counterintuitive sad idea that the closest that people feel to each other is in those moments of suffering, of being at the edge of seeing your comrades dying in your arms, that somehow brings people extremely closely together, suffering brings people closer together. How do you make sense of that? It might bring people close together but there are otherwise of bonding and being close to people I think without the suffering and death that war entails. Perhaps you could see you're going to hear the romanticized Russian in me. We tend to remind the society suffering just a little bit in our literature and culture and so on. Could you take a step back and I apologize if it's a ridiculous question but what is suffering? If you were trying to define what suffering is, how would you go about it? Suffering is a conscious state. There can be no suffering for a being who is completely unconscious and it's distinguished from other conscious states in terms of being one that considered just in itself. We would rather be with that. It's a conscious state that we want to stop if we're experiencing or we want to avoid having again if we've experienced it in the past. And that's, I say, emphasized for its own sake because of course people will say, well, suffering strengthens the spirit, it has good consequences and sometimes it does have those consequences and of course sometimes we might undergo suffering. We set ourselves a challenge to run a marathon or climb a mountain or even just to go to the dentist so that the tooth ache doesn't get worse even though we know the dentist is going to hurt us to some extent. So I'm not saying that we never choose suffering but I am saying that other things being equal we would rather not be in that state of consciousness. Is the ultimate goal sort of you have the new 10-year anniversary release of the life you can say book, really influential book. We'll talk about it a bunch of times throughout this conversation but do you think it's possible to eradicate suffering, errors that the goal or do we want to achieve a kind of minimum threshold of suffering and then keeping a little drop of poison to keep things interesting in the world. In practice I don't think we ever will eliminate suffering so I think that little drop of poison as you put it or if you like the contrasting dash of an unpleasant color perhaps something like that and otherwise harmonious and beautiful composition that is going to always be there. If you ask me whether in theory if we could get rid of it we should. I think the answer is whether in fact we would be better off or whether in terms of by eliminating the suffering we would also eliminate some of the highs, the positive highs and if that so then we might be prepared to say it's worth having a minimum of suffering in order to have the best possible experiences as well. Is there a relative aspect to suffering so when you talk about eradicating poverty in the world is this the more you succeed the more the bar of what defines poverty raises or is there at the basic human ethical level a bar that's absolute that wants to get above it then it we can morally converge to feeling like we have eradicated poverty. I think they're both and I think this is true for poverty as well as suffering there's an objective level of suffering or of poverty where we're talking about objective indicators like you're constantly hungry you don't you can't get enough food you're constantly cold you can't get warm you have some physical pains that you're never rid of I think those things are objective but it may also be true that if you do get rid of that and you get to the stage where all of those basic needs have been met there may still be then new forms of suffering that develop and perhaps that's what we're seeing in the affluent societies we have that people get bored for example they don't need to spend so many hours a day earning money to get enough to eat and shelter so now they board they like a sense of purpose that can happen and that then is a kind of a relative suffering that is distinct from the objective forms of suffering but in your focus on eradicating suffering you don't think about that kind of the the kind of interesting challenges and suffering that emerges in affluent societies that's just not in your ethical philosophical brain is that of interest at all it would be of interest to me if we had eliminated all of the objective forms of suffering which I think are as generally more severe and also perhaps easier at this stage any way to know how to eliminate so yes in some future state when we've eliminated those objective forms of suffering I would be interested in trying to eliminate the relative forms as well but that's not a practical need for me at the moment sorry to linger on it because you kind of said it but just is elimination the goal for the affluent society so is there a you know do you see a suffering as a creative force suffering can be a creative force I think I'm repeating what I said about the highs and whether we need some of the lows to experience the highs so it may be that suffering makes us more creative and we regard that as worthwhile maybe that that brings some of those highs with it that we would not have had if we'd had no suffering I don't really know many people have suggested that and I certainly can't have no basis for denying it and if it's true then I would not want to eliminate suffering completely but the focus is on the absolute not to be cold not to be hungry yes that's at the present stage of where the world's population is that's that's the focus talking about human nature for a second do you think people are inherently good or do we all have good and evil in us that basically everyone is capable of evil based on the environment certainly most of us have a potential for both good and evil I'm not prepared to say that everyone is capable of evil that maybe some people who even in the worst of circumstances would not be capable of it but most of us are very susceptible to environmental influences so when we look at things that we were talking about previously let's say the what the Nazis did during the Holocaust I think it's quite difficult to say I know that I would not have done those things even if I were in the same circumstances as those who did them even if let's say I had grown up under the Nazi regime and had been indoctrinated with racist ideas had also had the the idea that I must obey orders follow the commands of the Fuhrer plus of course perhaps the threat that if I didn't do certain things I might get sent to the Russian front and that would be a pretty grim fight I think it's really hard for anybody to say nevertheless I know I would not have killed those Jews or whatever it was that what's your intuition how many people will be able to say that truly be able to say it I think very few less than 10 percent to me it seems a very interesting and powerful thing to meditate on so I've read a lot about the war the world were two and I can't escape the thought that I would have not been one of the 10 percent right I have to say I simply don't know I would like to hope that I would have been one of the 10 percent but I don't really have any basis for claiming that I would have been different from the majority is it a worthwhile thing to contemplate it would be interesting if we could find a way of really finding these answers there obviously is quite a bit of research on people during the Holocaust on how ordinary Germans got led to do terrible things and there's what there are also studies of the resistance some heroic people in the White Rose group for example who resisted even though they knew they were likely to die for it but I don't know whether these studies really can answer your larger question of how many people would have been capable of doing that well sort of the reason I think it's interesting is in the world as you've described you know when when there are things that you'd like to do they're good that are objectively good it's useful to think about whether I'm not willing to do something or I don't even I'm not willing to acknowledge something as good in the right thing to do because I'm simply scared of putting my life of damaging my life in some kind of way and that kind of thought exercises helpful to understand what is what is the right thing in my current skill set and the capacity to do sort of there's things that are convenient and there's I wonder if there are things that are highly inconvenient where I would have to experience derision or hatred or or death or all those kinds of things but it's truly the right thing to do and that kind of balance is I feel like in America we don't have it's it's difficult to think in the current times it seems easier to put yourself back in history when you can sort of objectively contemplate whether how willing you are to do the right thing when the cost is high true but I think we do face those challenges today and I think we can still ask ourselves those questions so one one stand that I took more than 40 years ago now was to stop eating meat come of vegetarian at a time when you hardly met anybody who was a vegetarian or if you did they might have been a Hindu or they might have had some weird theories about meat and health and I know thinking about making that decision I was convinced that it was the right thing to do but I still did have to think our all my friends going to think that I'm a crank because I'm now refusing to eat meat so I'm not saying there were any terrible sanctions obviously but I thought about that and I guess I decided well I still think this is the right thing to do and if I'll put up with that if it happens and one or two friends were clearly uncomfortable with that decision but you know that was pretty minor compared to the historical examples that we've been talking about but other issues that we have around to like global poverty and what we ought to be doing about that is is another question where people I think can have have the opportunity to take a stand on what's the right thing to do now climate change would be a third question where again people are taking a stand I you know can look at Greta Tunberg there and say well I think it's must have taken a lot of courage for a schoolgirl to say I'm going to go and strike about climate change and see what happens yeah especially in this divisive world she gets exceptionally huge amounts of support and hatred both that's right she's a very difficult 14 ages to operate in in your book ethics in the real world amazing book people should check it out very easy read 82 brief essays on things that matter one of the essays asks should robots have rights you've written about this so let me ask should robots have rights if we ever develop robots capable of consciousness capable of having their own internal perspective on what's happening to them so that their lives can go well or badly for them then robots should have rights until that happens they shouldn't so consciousness essentially a prerequisite to suffering so everything that possesses consciousness is capable of suffering put another way and if so what is consciousness I certainly think that consciousness is a prerequisite for suffering you can't suffer if you're not conscious but is it true that every being it is conscious will suffer or has to be capable of suffering I suppose you could imagine a kind of consciousness especially if we can construct it artificially that's capable of experiencing pleasure but just automatically cuts at the consciousness when when they're suffering so they're like instant and a sthesio as soon as something is going to cause suffering so that's possible but doesn't exist as far as we know on this planet yet you asked what is consciousness philosophers often talk about it as they're being a subject of experiences so you and I and everybody listening to this is a subject of experience there is a conscious subject who is taking things in responding to it in various ways feeling good about it feeling bad about it and that's different from the kinds of artificial intelligence we have now I take out my phone I ask Google directions to where I'm going Google gives me the directions and I choose to take a different way you know Google doesn't care it's not like I'm offending Google or anything like that there is no subject of experiences there and I think that's the indication that Google AI we have now is is not conscious or at least that level of AI is not conscious and that's the way to think about it now it may be difficult to tell of course whether a certain AI is or isn't conscious it may mimic consciousness and we can't tell if it's only mimicking it or if it's the real thing but that's what we're looking for is there a subject of experience a perspective on the world from which things can go well or badly from that perspective so our idea of what what suffering looks like comes from our just watching our selves when we're in pain sort of when we're experiencing pleasure it's not only pleasure and pain yes yes so and then you could actually you could push back on us but I would say that's how we kind of build the intuition about animals is we can infer the similarities between humans and animals and so infer that they're suffering or not based on certain things and their conscious or not so what if robots you mentioned Google Maps and I've done this experiment so I work in robotics just for my own self or I have several Roomba robots and I play with different speech interaction voice-based interaction and if the Roomba or the robot or Google Maps shows any size of pain like screaming or moaning or being displeased by something you've done that in my mind I can't help but immediately upgrade it and even when I myself programmed it in just having another entity that's now for the moment disjoint for me showing size of pain makes me feel like it is conscious like I immediately then the whatever the I immediately realize it's not obviously but that feeling is there so sort of I guess I guess what do you think about a world where Google Maps and Roomba's are pretending to be conscious and we the descendants of apes are not smart enough to realize they're not or whatever or that is conscious they appear to be conscious and so you then have to give them rights the reason I'm asking that is that kind of capability maybe closer than than we realize yes that kind of capability may be closer but I don't think it follows that we have to give them rights I suppose the the argument for saying that in no circumstances we should give them rights is that if we don't we'll harden ourselves against other beings who are not robots and who really do suffer that's a possibility that you know if we get used to looking at a being suffering and saying yeah we don't have to do anything about that that being doesn't have your rights maybe we'll feel the same about animals for instance and interestingly among philosophers and thinkers who denied that we have any direct duties to animals and this includes people like Thomas Aquinas and Emanuel Kant they did say yes but still it's better not to be cruel to them not because of the suffering we're inflicting on the animals but because if we are we may develop a cruel disposition and this will be bad for humans you know because we were more likely to be cruel to other humans and that would be wrong so we're here in accept that I don't accept that as the basis of the argument for why we shouldn't be cruel to animals I think the base of the argument for why we shouldn't be cruel to animals is just that we're inflicting suffering on them and the suffering is a bad thing but possibly I might accept some sort of parallel of that argument as a reason why you shouldn't be cruel to these robots that mimic the symptoms of pain if it's going to be harder for us to distinguish I would venture to say I'd like to disagree with you and with most people I think at the risk of sounding crazy I would like to say that if that Roomba is dedicated to faking the consciousness in the suffering I think we will it will be impossible for us I would like to apply the same argument as with animals to robots that they deserve right in that sense now we might outlaw the addition of those kinds of features into Roombas but once you do I think I'm quite surprised by the upgrade in consciousness that the display of suffering creates it's a totally open world but I'd like to just serve the different scene animals and other humans is that in the robot case we've added it in ourselves therefore we can say something about the how real it is but I would like to say that the display of it is what makes it real and there's some I'm not a philosopher I'm not making that argument but at least like to add that as a possibility and I've been surprised by it is all I'm trying to sort of articulate poorly I suppose so there is a philosophical view has been held about humans which is rather like what you're talking about and that's behaviorism so behaviorism was employed both in psychology people like BF Skinner was a famous behaviorist but in psychology it was more a kind of a what is it that makes this science what you need to have behavior because that's what you can observe you can't observe consciousness but in philosophy the view is defended by people like Gilbert Ryle who was a professor of philosophy at Oxford wrote a book called The Concept of Mind in which you know in this kind of phase this is in the 40s of linguistic philosophy he said well the the meaning of a term is its use and we use terms like so and so is in pain when we see somebody writhing or screaming or trying to escape some stimulus and that's the meaning of the term so that's what it is to be in pain and you point to the behavior and Norman Malcolm who was another philosopher in the school from Cornell had the view that you know so what is it to dream after all we can't see other people's dreams well when people wake up and say I've just had a dream of you know here I was undressed walking down the main street or whatever it is you've dreamt and that's what it is to have a dream it's to basically to wake up and recall something so you could apply this to to what you're talking about and say so what it is to be in pain is to exhibit these symptoms of pain behavior and therefore these robots are in pain that's what the word means but nowadays not many people think that Ryle's kind of philosophical behaviorism is really very plausible so I think they would say the same about your view so yes I just spoke with no Tromsky who basically was part of dismantling the behaviors movement but and I'm with that a hundred percent for studying human behavior but I am one of the few people in the world who has made Rumba's scream in pain and I just don't know what to do with that empirical evidence because it's hard to sort of philosophically agree but the only reason I philosophically agree in that case is because I was the programmer but if somebody else was a programmer I'm not sure I would be able to interpret that well so it's I think it's a new world that I was just curious what your thoughts are for now you feel that the display of the what we can kind of intellectual say is a fake display of suffering is not suffering that's right that would be my view but that's consistent of course with the idea that it's part of our nature to respond to this display if it's reasonable you're authentically done and therefore it's understandable that people would feel this and maybe as I said it's even a good thing that they do feel it and you wouldn't want to harden yourself against it because then you might harden yourself against beings who are really suffering but there's a slide you know so you said once a artificial general intelligence system a human level intelligence system become conscious I guess if I could just linger on it now I've wrote really dumb programs that just say things that I told them to say but how do you know when a when a system like Alexa which is officially complex that you can introspect the how it works starts giving you signs of consciousness through natural language that there's a there's a feeling there's another entity there that's self-aware that has a fear of death a mortality that has awareness of itself that we kind of associate with other living creatures I guess I'm sort of trying to do the slippery slope from the very naive thing where I started into into something where it's sufficiently a black box towards starting to feel like it's conscious where's that threshold where you would start getting uncomfortable with the idea of a robot suffering do you think I don't know enough about the programming that we're going to this really to answer this question but I presume that somebody who does know more about this could could look at the program and see whether we can explain the behaviors in a parsimonious way that doesn't require us to suggest that some sort of consciousness has emerged or alternatively whether you're in a situation where you say I don't know how this is happening the program does generate a kind of artificial general intelligence which is autonomous you know starts to do things itself and is autonomous of the basics programming it set it up and so it's quite possible actually we have achieved consciousness in a system of artificial intelligence sort of the approach that I work with most of the communities really excited about now is with learning methods so machine learning and the learning methods are unfortunately are not capable of revealing which is why somebody like nomchowski criticizes them you've created powerful systems that are able to do certain things without understanding the the theory the physics the science of how it works and so it's possible if those are the kinds of methods that succeed we won't be able to know exactly sort of try to reduce try to find whether this thing is conscious or not this thing is intelligent or not it's simply giving when we talk to it it displays wit and humor and cleverness and emotion and fear and then we won't be able to say where in the billions of nodes neurons in this artificial neural network is the fear coming from so in that case that's a really interesting place where we do now start to return to behaviorism and say yeah that's that is an interesting issue I would say that if we have serious dads and think it might be conscious then we ought to try to give it the benefit of the dad just as I would say with animals we I think we can be highly confident that vertebrates are conscious but when we get down and some invertebrates like the octopus but but within sects it's much harder to be to be confident of that I think we should give them the benefit of the dad where we can which means you know I think it would be wrong to torture an insect but this doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong to slap a mosquito that's a bad to bite you and stop you getting to sleep so I think you you try to achieve some balance in these circumstances are uncertainty if it's okay with you if we can go back just briefly so 44 years ago like you mentioned 40 plus years ago you've written animal liberation the classic book that started that launched it was a foundation of the movement of animal liberation do you can you summarize the key set of ideas that underpin an epoch certainly the the key idea that underlies that book is the concept of speciesism which I did not invent that term I took it from a man called Richard Rider who was in Oxford when I was and I saw a pamphlet that he'd written about experiments on chimpanzees that used that term but I think I contributed to making it philosophically more precise and to getting it into a to a broader audience and the idea is that we have a bias or prejudice against taking seriously the interests of beings who are not members of our species just as in the past Europeans for example had a bias against taking seriously the interest of African racism and men have had a bias against taking seriously the interests of women sexism so I think something analogous not completely identical but something analogous goes on and has gone on for a very long time with the way humans see themselves vis-a-vis animals we see ourselves as more important we see animals as existing to serve our needs in various ways and you can find this very explicit in earlier philosophers from Aristotle through to count others and either we don't need to take their interests into account at all or we can discount it because they're not humans they they can a little bit but they don't count nearly as much as humans do my book I use that that attitude is responsible for a lot of the things that we do to animals that are wrong confiding them indoors in very crowded cramped conditions in factory farms to produce meat or eggs or milk more cheaply using them in some research that's by no means essential for our survival or well-being and a whole lot you know some of the sports and things that we do to animals so I think that's unjustified because I think the significance of pain and suffering does not depend on the species of the being who is in pain or suffering any more than it depends on the race or sex with the being who is in pain or suffering and I think we ought to rethink our treatment of animals along the lines of saying if the pain is just as great in animal then it's just as bad that it happens as if it were a human maybe if I could ask I apologize hopefully it's not a ridiculous question but so as far as we know we cannot communicate with animals through natural language but we would be able to communicate with robots so returning to sort of a small parallel between perhaps animals in the future of AI if we do create an AGI system or as we approach creating that AGI system what kind of questions would you ask her to try to to try to intuit whether whether there is consciousness whether or more importantly whether there's capacity to suffer I might ask the AGI what she was feeling to well does she have feelings and if she says yes to describe those feelings to describe what they were like to see what the phenomenal account of consciousness is like that's one question I might also try to find out if the AGI has a sense of itself so for example the idea would you you know we often ask people so suppose you're in a car accident and your brain were transplanted into someone else's body do you think you would survive or would it be the person whose body was still surviving you know your body having been destroyed and most people say I think I would you know if my brain was transplanted along with my memories and so on I would survive so we could ask AGI those kinds of questions if they were transferred to a different piece of hardware would they survive what would survive that's what it's sort of on that line another perhaps absurd question but do you think having a body is necessary for consciousness so do you think digital beings can suffer presumably digital beings need to be running on some kind of hardware right yeah the ultimately boils down to but this is exactly what you said is moving the brain right so you could move it to a different kind of hardware you know and I could say look you know your hardware is needs is getting worn out we're going to transfer you to a fresh piece of hardware so we're going to shut you down for a time but don't worry you know you'll be running very soon on the nice fresh piece of hardware and you could imagine this a conscious AGI saying that's fine I don't mind having a little rest just make sure you don't lose me or something like that yeah I mean that's an interesting thought that even with us humans the suffering is in the software we right now don't know how to repair the hardware yeah but we're getting better at it and better in the idea I mean a lot of some people dream about one day being able to transfer certain aspects of the software to another piece of hardware what do you think just on that topic there's been a lot of exciting innovation in brain computer interfaces I don't know if you're familiar with the companies like Neuralinco de LaMos communicating both ways from a computer being able to send activate neurons and being able to read spikes from neurons with the dream of being able to expand sort of increase the bandwidth at which your brain can like look up articles on Wikipedia kind of thing yeah expand the cap the knowledge capacity of the brain do you think that notion is is that interesting to you as as the expansion of the human mind yes that's very interesting I'd love to be able to have that increased bandwidth and I you know I want better access to my memory I have to say too is a yet older you know you I talked to my wife about things that we did 20 years ago something her memory is often better about particular events where were we who was at that event what did he or she were even she may know and I have not the faintest idea about this but perhaps it's somewhere in my memory and if I had this extended memory I could I could search that particular year and rerun those things I think that would be great in some sense we already have that by storing so much of our data online like pictures of different yes well Gmail is fantastic for that because you know people people email me as if they know me well and I haven't got a clue who they are but then I searched for their name I just emailed me in 2007 and I know who they are now yeah so we're already they were taking the first steps already so on the flip side of AI people like Stuart Russell and others focus on the control problem value alignment in AI which is the problem of making sure we build systems that align to our own values our ethics do you think sort of high level how do we go about building systems do you think is it possible that align with our values align with our human ethics or living being ethics presumably it's it's possible to do that um I know that a lot of people who think that there's a real danger that we won't that we're more or less accidentally lose control of of AI do you have that here yourself personally um I'm not quite sure what to think uh I talked to philosophers like Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord and they think that this is a real problem uh we need to worry about um then I talk to people who work for Microsoft or DeepMind or somebody and they say no we're not really that close to producing uh IGI you know superintelligence so if you look at Nick Bostrom sort of the arguments that it's very hard to defend so I'm of course an IMS self engineer AS system so I'm more with the DeepMind folks where it seems that we're really far away but then the counter argument is is there any fundamental reason that we'll never achieve it and if not then eventually there'll be a dire existential risk so we should be concerned about it and do you have do you have uh do you find that argument at all appealing in this domain or any domain that eventually this will be a problem so we should be worried about it yes I think it's a problem I think there's that's a valid point um of course when you say eventually uh that raises the question how far off is that and is there something that we can do about it now because if we're talking about this is going to be a hundred years in the future uh and you consider how rapidly our knowledge of artificial intelligence has grown in the last 10 or 20 years it seems unlikely that there's anything much we could do now that would influence whether this is going to happen uh a hundred years in the future you know people in 80 years in the future would be in a much better position to say this is what we need to do to prevent this happening than than we are now so to some extent I find that reassuring but I'm all in favor of some people doing research into this to see if indeed it is that far off or if we are in a position to do something about it sooner um I'm I'm very much of the view that extinction is a terrible thing and therefore even if the risk of extinction is very small uh if we can reduce that risk that's something that we ought to do um my disagreement with some of these people who talk about long-term risks extinction risks uh is only about how much priority that should have as compared to present questions no such as if you look at the math of it from a utlitarian perspective if it's existential risks so everybody dies that there's like it feels like an infinity in the math equation that that makes the the math with the priorities difficult to do that if we don't know the timescale and you can legitimately argue this non-zero probability that it'll happen tomorrow that how do you deal with these kinds of existential risks like from nuclear war from nuclear weapons from biological weapons from I'm not sure global warming falls into that category because global warming is a lot more gradual and people say it's not an existential risk because there'll always be possibilities of some humans existing froming Antarctica or more than Siberia or something of that so yeah well you don't have to find the sort of the the complete existential risks of fundamental um like an overriding part of the equations of ethics of wood no uh you know certainly if you if you're treated as an infinity then it plays havoc with any calculations but arguably we shouldn't I mean one of the ethical assumptions that goes into this is that the loss of future lives that is of merely possible lives of beings who may never exist at all is in some way comparable to the sufferings or deaths of people who who do exist at some point um and that's not clear to me I think there's a case for saying that but I also think there's a case for taking the other view so that has some impact on it of course you might say ah yes but still if there's some uncertainty about this and the the costs of extinction are infinite then still it's going to overwhelm in everything else but I suppose I I'm not convinced of that I'm not convinced that it's really infinite here and even Nick Bostrom in his discussion of this doesn't claim that there'll be an infinite number of lives left he and what is a 10 to the 56th or something it's a vast number that I think he calculates this is assuming we can upload consciousness onto these you know digital form digital forms and therefore there'll be much more energy efficient but he calculates the amount of energy in the universe or something like that so the number is a vast but not infinite which gives you some prospect maybe of resisting some of the argument the beautiful thing with Nick's arguments is he quickly jumps from the individual scale to the universal scale which is just awe inspiring to think right when you think about the entirety of the span of time of the universe it's both interesting from a computer science perspective AI perspective and from an ethical perspective the idea of utilitarianism because you say what is utilitarianism? Utilitarianism is the ethical view that the right thing to do is the act that has the greatest expected utility where what that means is it's the act that will produce the best consequences discounted by the odds that you won't be able to produce those consequences that something will go wrong but in simple case let's assume we we have certainty about what the consequences of actions will be then the right action is the action that will produce the best consequences is that always and by the way there's a bunch of new on stuff the talk with Sam Harris on this podcast on the people should go listen to it's great the same two hours of moral philosophy discussion but is that an easy calculation? No it's a difficult calculation and actually there's one thing that I need to add and that is utilitarians certainly the classical utilitarians think that by best consequences we're talking about happiness and the absence of pain and suffering there are other consequentialists who are not really utilitarians who say there are different things that could be good consequences justice freedom human dignity knowledge they all kind as good consequences too and that makes the calculations even more difficult because then you need to know how to balance these things off if you are just talking about well-being using that term to express happiness and the absence of suffering uh I think that the calculation becomes more manageable in a philosophical sense it's still in practice we don't know how to do it we don't know how to measure quantities of happiness and misery we don't know how to calculate the probabilities the different actions will produce this or that uh so at best we can use it as a as a rough guide to different actions and one way we have to focus on the short term consequences because we just can't really predict all of the longer term ramifications so what about the sort of what what about the the extreme suffering of very small groups sort of utilitarianism is focused on the overall aggregate right how do you would you say yourself a utilitarian yes I know so do you what do you make of the the difficult ethical maybe poetic suffering of very few individuals I think it's possible that that gets overwritten by benefits to very large numbers of individuals uh I think that can can be the right answer but before we conclude that is the right answer we have to know how severe the suffering is and how that compares with the the benefits uh so I I tend to think that uh extreme suffering is worse than or is further if you like below the neutral level than extreme happiness or bliss is above it so when I think about the worst experience as possible and the best experiences as possible I don't think of them as equidistant from neutral so like it's a scale that goes from minus 100 through zero as a neutral level to plus 100 um because I know that I would not exchange an hour of my most pleasurable experiences for an hour of my most painful experiences even I wouldn't have an hour of my most painful experiences even for two hours or ten hours of my most painful experiences can I say that correctly yeah yeah maybe 20 hours then yeah well one what's the exchange rate so that's the question what is the exchange rate but I think it's it can be quite high so that's why you shouldn't just assume that um you know it's okay to make one person suffer extremely in order to make two people much better off it might be a much larger number but at some point I do think you should aggregate and and the result will be even though it violates our intuitions of justice and fairness whatever it might be of giving priority to those who are worse off um at some point I still think that will be the right thing to do yeah it's some complicated nonlinear function uh can I ask to sort of out their question is the more we put our data out there the more we're able to measure a bunch of factors of each of our individual human lives and I could foresee the ability to estimate well being of whatever we public we together collectively agree and as a good objective function for from a utilitarian perspective do you think do you think it'll be possible and is a good idea to push that kind of analysis to make then public decisions perhaps with the help of AI that you know here's a tax rate here's a tax rate at which well-being will be optimized and yeah that would be right if we could if we really knew that if we could really calculate that no but do you think it's possible to converge towards an agreement amongst humans towards an objective um function as it's just a hopeless pursuit I don't think it's hopeless I think it's difficult would be difficult to get converged towards agreement at least at present because some people would say uh you know I've got different views about justice and I think you ought to give priority to those who are worse off even though I acknowledge that the gains that the worse off are making our less than the gains that those who are sort of medium badly off could be making um so we still have all of these intuitions that we we argue about uh so I don't think we would get agreement but the fact that we wouldn't get agreement uh doesn't show that there isn't a right answer there do you think who gets to say what is right and wrong do you think there's place for ethics oversight from uh from the government so I'm thinking in the case of AI overseeing what is uh what kind of decisions AI can make or not but also if you look at animal animal rights or rather not rights or perhaps rights but the ideas you've explored in animal liberation who gets to so you eloquently beautifully right in your book that this here you know we shouldn't do this but is there some harder rules that should be imposed or is this a collective thing we've converged towards a society and thereby make the better and better ethical decisions politically I'm still a Democrat despite looking at the flaws in democracy and the way it doesn't work always very well so I don't see a better option than allowing the public to vote for governments in accordance with their policies and I hope that they will vote for policies policies that reduce the suffering of animals and they reduce the suffering of distant humans whether geographically distant or distant because they're future humans but I recognize that democracy isn't really well set up to do that and in a sense you could imagine a wise and benevolent you know omnibinevolent leader who would do that better than democracy's could but in the world in which we live it's difficult to imagine that this leader isn't going to be corrupted by a variety of influences you know we've we've had so many examples of people who've taken power with good intentions and then have ended up being corrupt and favoring themselves so I don't know you know that's why as I say I don't know that we have a better system than democracy to make these decisions well so you also discuss effective altruism which is a mechanism for going around government for putting the power in the hands of the people to donate money towards causes to help you know remove the middleman and give it directly to the to the causes that they care about sort of maybe this is a good time to ask you've 10 years ago wrote the life you can save that's now think available for free online that's right you can download either the ebook or the audio book free from the life you can save.org and what are the key ideas that you present in in the book the main thing I want to do in the book is to make people realize that it's not difficult to help people in extreme poverty that there are highly effective organizations now that are doing this that they've been independently assessed and verified by research teams that are expert in this area and that it's a fulfilling thing to do to for at least part of your life you know we can't all be saints but at least one of your goals should be to really make a positive contribution to the world and to do something to help people who know fault of their own are in very dire circumstances and and living a life that is barely or perhaps not at all a decent life for a human being to live. So you describe a a minimum ethical standard of giving what what advice would you give to people that want to be effectively altruistic in their life like live and affect the vulturism life. There are many different kinds of ways of living as an effective altruist and if you're at the point where you're thinking about your long-term career I'd recommend you take a look at a website called 80,000 hours 80,000 hours.org which looks at ethical career choices and they range from for example going to work on Wall Street so that you can earn a huge amount of money and then donate most of it to effective charities to going to work for a really good non-profit organization so that you can directly use your skills and ability and hard work to further a good cause or perhaps going into politics maybe small chances but big payoffs in politics go to work in the public service if you're talented you might rise to a high level where you can influence decisions do research in an area where the payoffs could be great there are a lot of different opportunities but too few people are even thinking about those questions they're just going along in some sort of preordained rut to particular careers maybe they think they'll earn a lot of money and have a comfortable life but they may not find that as fulfilling as actually knowing that they're making a positive difference to the world. What about in terms of so that's like long term 80,000 hours shorter term giving part of well actually it's a part of that and going to work at Wall Street if you would like to give a percentage of your income that you talk about and life you can save that I mean I was looking through it's quite a compelling I mean I'm just a dumb engineer so I like there's simple rules there's a nice percentage. Okay so I do actually set out suggested levels of giving because people often ask me about this a popular answer is give 10% the traditional ties that's recommended in Christianity and also Judaism but you know why should it be the same percentage irrespective of your income a tax scales reflect the idea that the more income you have the more you can pay tax and I think the same is true in what you can give so I do set out a progressive donor scale which starts at 1% for people on modest incomes and rises to 33 and a third percent for people who are really earning a lot and my idea is that I don't think any of these amounts really impose real hardship on people because they are progressive and good to income so I think anybody can do this and can know that they're doing something significant to play their part in reducing the huge gap between people in extreme poverty in the world and people living afternoon lives and aside from it being an ethical life it's one they find more fulfilling because like there's something about our human nature that or some of our human nature's maybe most of our human nature that enjoys doing the the ethical thing. Yeah so I make both those arguments that it it isn't ethical requirement and the kind of world we live in today to help people in great need when we can easily do so but also that it is a rewarding thing and there's good psychological research showing that people who give more tend to be more satisfied with their lives and I think this has something to do with having a purpose that's larger than yourself and therefore never being if you like never never being bored sitting around oh you know what will I do next I've got nothing to do in a world like this there are many good things that you can do and enjoy doing them plus you're working with other people in the effect of altruism movement who are forming a community of other people with similar ideas and they tend to be interesting thoughtful and good people as well and having friends of that sort is another big contribution to having a good life. So we talked about big things that are beyond ourselves but we're we're also just human and mortal do you ponder your own mortality is there insights about your philosophy the ethics that you gain from pondering your own mortality? Clearly you know as you get into your 70s you can't help thinking about your own mortality but I don't know that I have great insights into that from my philosophy I don't think there's anything after the death of my body you know assuming that we won't be able to upload my mind into anything at the time when I die so I don't think there's any afterlife or anything to look forward to in that sense. Be feared death so if you look at Ernest Becker describing the motivating aspects of our ability to be cognizant of our mortality do you have any of those elements in your driving your motivation life? I suppose the fact that you have only a limited time to achieve the things that you want to achieve gives you some sort of motivation to get going and achieving them and if we thought we're immortal we might say you know I can put that off for another decade or two so there's that about it but otherwise you know no I'd rather have more time to do more I'd also like to be able to see how things go that I'm interested in is climate change going to turn out to be as dire as a lot of scientists say that it is going to be will we somehow scrape through with less damage than we thought I'd really like to know the answers to those questions but I guess I'm not going to. Well you said there's nothing afterwards so let me ask the Immorups or question what do you think is the meaning of it all? I think the meaning of life is the meaning we give to it I don't think that we were brought into the universe for any kind of larger purpose but given that we exist I think we can recognize that some things are objectively bad extreme suffering as an example and other things are objectively good like having a rich fulfilling enjoyable pleasurable life and we can try to do our part in reducing the bad things and increasing the good things. So one way the meaning is to do a little bit more of the good things objectively good things and let it be less of the bad things. Yes so as much of the good things as you can and as little of the bad things. Peter beautifully put I don't think there's a better place to end it thank you so much for talking today.
