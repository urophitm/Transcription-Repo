Dr. Marie McNleigh is here to bring you the brilliant minds who are making these discoveries so they can share their incredible stories and take you on an amazing journey. Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to People Behind the Science. I am delighted to be speaking with our guest researcher Dr. Simon Sponberg today so Simon welcome to our show. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. Let me be here. Well we are looking forward to learning more about you in your research but let me first start by telling our listeners a little bit about your background. So listeners, Simon is the Dunn Family Professor and Assistant Professor in the School of Physics and the School of Biological Sciences as well as Adjunct Assistant Professor and Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology or Georgia Tech. He received his bachelor's degree in Physics and Biology from Lewis and Clark College and his PhD in Integrative Biology from the University of California Berkeley. Afterwards Simon conducted post-doctoral research at the University of Washington before joining the faculty there at Georgia Tech and he has been the recipient of a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship and Biological Informatics, the University of Washington Postdoctoral Mentoring Award, the Young Investigator Award from the International Society for Neuroethology, a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development or Career Award, a Klinginstein Simon's Fellowship in the Neurosciences and a Hertz Fellowship. And in our interview today Simon is going to share more about his life and his science. So Simon let's start by talking about life outside the lab and how you spend your time. I think maybe my favorite thing to do outside of the lab is to cook and there's a little bit of an interesting story behind that and that I was once interviewing for a fellowship position and I felt like the interview was going really, really horribly and then the interviewer asked me, oh what do you like to do outside of science and I said, oh I really like to cook and it's like oh me too and we went on for like half an hour about cooking and how it's sort of like doing experiments that actually work sometimes. So I firmly believe that that's what got me that fellowship but more importantly I think it's my creative outlet and how I enjoy taking up my time outside of science and sort of bring my head space into just what I'm working on right at that moment and then it's something that you can share with people which is a lot of fun too sometimes. I love it. It's a practical hobby. I really like to get outside too. Hiking is probably the thing that I most enjoy. My wife says that she likes me a lot better when I'm on top of the mountain and I think that's a fair point that when you sort of get outside it changes your perspective on the world and what you're doing and gives you a bit of time to reflect and I've always really doubted that. Well it sounds like you have some phenomenal hobbies and ways to spend your time outside of the lab. I'm fascinated by this cooking thing that you mentioned so what are some of the things you like to cook? Is this desserts we're talking? Are we talking full meals? I most like to cook with people but my favorite thing actually is to try to cook things that are from different cultures and things that I've been exposed to being in science. You meet a lot of people from different parts of the world so I've learned from them a lot of different interesting things and whatever they share with me a certain type of food or drink that they like to do. It's really fun to go back and try and create that and see what's so interesting about it to them. So I spent a lot of time in China when I was an undergraduate and so I really enjoyed trying to cook Chinese food. I'm not sure if I was very good at it but I enjoy trying. I think it's the process of cooking and baking are a bit different because baking you tend to have to be very precise and cooking you tend to be a little bit more creative and wacky and it's more likely to work if it's creative and wacky than if you're creative and wacky and baking and so I definitely like the sort of cooking aspect a bit more. But I think the other part of it is that I've always been very fascinated by tea and coffee and drinks that pretty much every culture tends to use some kind of beverage as like a way of socially interacting with people and I've always found that really interesting that the different traditions are around the China and India and the T-Ceremony in Japan and China couldn't be more different and really reflect some of the differences in the cultures and the way that we use hosting people here always offering them a drink when they come in actually the USS a bunch of different traditions that we use for drinks we host people. So I've always found that sort of very interesting it's a reflection of the sort of history and culture of a place and as a way to work with people together. Very cool. Well Simon it's been wonderful to hear more about your life outside of science but I'd love to talk about your work as well so can you tell us next how you describe your work to people who aren't in your field or maybe aren't familiar with science. So I like to describe my work is trying to understand how the brain works with muscles to make bodies move. I'm really fascinated by the fact that animals have achieved the ability to move in pretty much every environment on this planet and they oftentimes do so with sort of a grace that we find really hard to capture and our robotics are a created systems that's starting to change. For starting to get robots that are really really good at doing certain kinds of movement but the sort of repertoire of movements that animals from humans to co-proaches are capable of generating is really remarkable to me and I think it reflects a lot about how our brains think about and process the world around us. I think that the way that brains process the world around us is very informed by the movement that we do through that world that shapes one information we have to take in how we have to react to that information and what we do with that information. So in many ways I'm a neuroscientist but I'm a neuroscientist who first tries to study the body and the muscles so that I know what the brain has to do. Well I think your work is fascinating and I'm looking forward to chatting about some more specific projects as we go through our conversation today but I'd love to take a moment to talk about motivation here at the beginning. I know my listeners and myself are always on the lookout for a little motivational quotes saying things to get us through our day so do you have a favorite that you can share with us Simon? I have a quote that it's thought to be an Isaac Asimov quote and I've heard several different ways that it's written out so I'll give you my favorite although it might actually be a paraphrase so don't quote but the phrase is the most exciting words in science that is that herald the greatest discoveries are not Eureka but rather that's funny and I think that that's a really interesting quote because it's certainly wrong true for me that it's very rare that when we're going about our science that I think we know exactly what the outcome is going to be and then we're just confirming it and when we see it we're like Eureka and everything makes sense right that's not the experience I've had usually the things that have heralded the greatest moments in science for me but also the most frustrating has been when I'm expecting something to happen in a certain way and then it's quite different and I'm like that's really weird and trying to sort through that weirdness and that complexity is a real challenge and initially you can feel really frustrating because things aren't going the way I'm expecting them to go but it's happened enough to me now that I know I should stick with it and see where it beats me and I think that's especially true when you're studying things like organismal biology and biophysics because we're dealing with really complex systems here right a moving body even an insect is extraordinarily complex hundreds of thousands of neurons many many muscles lots of different behaviors so it shouldn't be too surprising that it doesn't sort of conform to our initial expectations but trying to sort of be open and understanding where the data is leading it was I think a real fun part of the science for me definitely I think I can say from firsthand experience myself as well that things often don't go as planned and this can always put you in a fervor to kind of figure out why which I think is a really exciting part of the job can also really stress you out if you're feeling a lot of pressure to get something done and then you've got a presentation coming up and you're analyzing the data and I go I know what the state is going to say and then it doesn't work out that way initially you can be really really stressful because that's not what I expected the impending deadlines right right then your story has to change or you think you're crafting a story that sounds really good to yourself and then you see something in the data that doesn't conform with that story and you're like oh well that's not how it's working so I have to go back and figure out what the real story is behind that and initially that that's extraordinarily frustrating and it's still very challenging but usually I found in the end it leads to a more interesting more depthful story that opens up more questions definitely and I think sometimes mentors or role models or even just colleagues can help you get through some of these situations where you're stressed out trying to figure out what to do next so I'd love to talk about some of the people who might have helped you along your career maybe inspire you at the very beginning so Simon do you have some of these role models or inspirational figures of your own yeah I think the person who is probably the most immediate role model for me was I post off to other advisor Tom Daniel I've had other people who have perhaps been more purely inspirational or even more challenging but as somebody who is a very successful scientist and extraordinarily happy doing the science at least it seems like it and I think he genuinely is and also somebody who I very much respect is a person and a mentor and this ability to communicate with others I really have a great deal of respect for Tom and that's why I actually went to go work with him was that his science was very inspiring and the stuff that we could do together would be really really cool but I also worked with him because I wanted to understand how he sort of put the pieces together to be a happy scientist along the way I've had a lot of other people that I think most of us have been in science for a while feel like we've had a lot of role models and mentors along the way for me at least Tom's the closest thing to a role model in that full package kind of way but I think a lot of times we have role models for different elements of what we do there's people in the field that I very much look up to and admire their work Michael they can send us this extraordinary work that I've always found really inspiring to read about and other people have other aspects to their life that have been really well put together and my wife and I are both academics and getting two jobs in academia is very challenging so we've had a couple of role models in that front definitely and you touched on some of these different stages of your own career and I'd like to rewind it all the way back to the beginning Simon can you talk a little bit about what first sparked your interest in science and where it went from there well it certainly wasn't for a love of insects I do do a lot of work on insects but I actually had a very traumatic experience with this cicada when I was six there is cicadas said these exoskeletons and I was living in New Jersey at the time and there were a bunch of exoskeletons around in the bushes and I was going around looking at them because they looked really odd and I would reach out to pick one up and there was a live cicada behind it and I didn't realize it hadn't fully said it and it made this really lots of cicadas sound that really startled me so I like to tell that story because I think it's important to recognize that we don't always need to be inspired from an early age about what we're doing I'm not somebody who when I was six I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I've been doing that ever since that's great when it happens and more power to the people that do that but for a lot of us I think we sometimes go around looking for where the inspiration is coming from and sometimes feeling our life needs to change at different points in time and I think that's important to recognize is that you really do have that sort of power to redirect your life the many different times I still feel that way sometimes I wonder and sometimes I do go into different directions with my science and what I've done before because I get inspired in new ways but to go back to the original question I think one of the things that really got me inspired in how to think about the world was I had a very good middle school teacher Mr. Gagermeier who was in Montana which is where I was growing up at the time and he led this program that's a national program called Future Problems Oliver where you sort of get together with a team of other students and you're given a scenario that takes place or the near future science fiction story about humans going to colonize Mars or the outbreak of major diseases they're very hard to treat or new economic systems or new science discoveries that are shaping the world in different ways and in that scenario you're then supposed to brainstorm a bunch of potential problems that could come up and then identify sort of an underlying problem that might challenge society in a number of different ways and then you're supposed to brainstorm a bunch of potential solutions to that problem it's actually a competition to try and come up with these ideas and you get sort of more points the more creative you are and the more different fields you bring into posing those problems and those solutions and I found that really really fun sort of like a blue sky brainstorming idea and I think that really got me interested into thinking about the future and not just the kinds of solutions that we need but even what are the real problems that we need to try and address and what are the gaps in our knowledge and how would a basic understanding of how the world works that are in form us to be able to play the foundations for future solutions and discoveries. Well it sounds like a wonderful experience when you were getting interested and excited about science and problem solving sort of this critical thinking that's important for research at an early age how then did you decide to make this a career? I was having a real difficulty when I went to undergraduate when I was trying to decide where to go for my undergraduate degree because I was trying to decide what I should major in and I knew I was pretty interested in science but there were a lot of different fields of science that I got and sort of interested in and it was also pretty interested in philosophy and history and international studies so I was sort of going back and forth and I had a phone call with one of the professors at Lewis and Clark College Michael Brady before I went there and he was asking me what I wanted to do when I went to college and it's like if I was doing science I would really like to do something that has some biology but at the same time I'm really fundamentally interested in physics and the approach that physics takes so it'd be really cool if there was some way to combine those two things you know I never really heard of biophysics before and of course like Brady said oh well I'm a biophysicist that's what I do all day so we have a very fun conversation about that and I think that that's what's driven it but I think that's the sort of optimistic positive story but when I went to Lewis and Clark I started as a physics major and after a couple of years I had done a number of the physics classes and I was looking for research and a type of physics that was really interesting to me was classical mechanics the kind of physics that a lot of people say oh well that's just solved there's nothing new and interesting to do in that I had several faculty members that necessarily Lewis and Clark college but around so to say oh there's not really a much interesting research to do in that but of course that's not really true that was right after the 90s and there was all this study on chaos theory and fractals and nonlinear dynamics and new ways of thinking about complex systems even in classical physics and I didn't know about any of that and unfortunately at the time I didn't have a lot of people around me that had exposure to that so I sort of went around looking for places to do interesting classical mechanics research and because I had still been really interested in biology I happened to take compared physiology class about how different animals sort of solve different problems in their environments in different ways and that was really eye-opening to me and I sort of connected with this biology professor I feller on him who was studying how geth that stick to walls and I found that a really interesting convergence of sort of biology and physics and ever since then I've always been looking for this sort of interface of what we call organismal biology studies the study of the biology is the whole organism or the physiological systems of the organism and how that can interface with physics and I've been very happy and excited that that's now really becoming a growing field with a lot more people interested in it I think. Definitely so then what are some of the other key incidents or happenings that helped you get to where you are today there at Georgia Tech? One of the things that helped that was really useful is that I went to a very flexible graduate program effortly where I was sort of able to create my own set of classes and experiences to sort of shape my own graduate program I was also fortunate to be on a Hertz fellowship which really pushes you to not do things the way that people necessarily want you to do but in the way that you want to do it set of create your sort of vision with your graduate work they try and give you funding as a graduate student to sort of strike out and do your own vision of what's going to go and I think that's generally wherever people have flexibility to do that it's difficult to get that flexibility and I'm very grateful for the flexibility but we all have that flexibility sometimes in our lives and whenever we do I think it's really important to try and take that opportunity to shape things through your own vision of what you want to have happen rather than just sort of going along with what other people are doing or what your advisor is doing but that flexible program effortly was very helpful and most importantly I think I was really surprised in hindsight I don't think I should have been but I was very surprised in graduate school how much of your experience is more shaped by your peers around you being surrounded by really really people studying very different things and I think having that environment peers around you was a very important feature to sort of shape in me as a scientist definitely and then how did you go through the experience of your postdoc I know this is a stressful time for a lot of scientists because it's almost a bridge between graduate school and then getting that permanent position so you almost feel like you have to start thinking about the future even when you're just starting that next step yeah it's a bridge where you don't even know if there's an end to the bridge right that's stressful part I guess like walking through a really dense fall like on the golden gate bridge on a really foggy day you'll hope that it ends somewhere and I think that uncertainty is really stressful so a lot of people describe the postdoc as an extraordinary time one where you have very few constraints and you can sort of express your intellectual freedom and I think the people who describe it that way are people who have then gone on to a successful position after the postdoc so they have the benefit of hindsight and knowing that it would work out to sort of describe that and I think it is true like there is a lot of flexibility and joy that you can take in doing a postdoc because it's sort of like getting a duo from your graduate career except you sort of know what you're doing a little bit more that time it's your second shot at creating not just a single scientific project but a set of scientific projects that fit together and that's really exciting and fun but it's sort of colored by a lot of stress that uncertainty about what's going to happen next especially if you're pushing for a faculty position so it's very common and I think it's really important to acknowledge that it's really easy to feel impostery during that time and we know to have questions about whether if you're good enough for doing good enough work or what kind of work is needed or am I on the right track and it's the research that I'm doing the right track that I should have gone on to is this where I should have come to a postdoc should I go do another postdoc so it's a fun flexible free time but it's also a bit of an uncertain time and I was fortunate to have a really good mentorship environment that's when I worked with Tom Daniel and also with Adrian Farahol she was my second advisor for my postdoc and I was a lot of fun because she came from a physics background and Tom to biology especially came from a very sort of mixed background in science in a sense of field study so I found that really a fun and supportive environment to be in I felt like I had the security sort of explore the things that I wanted to explore and the freedom to explore so I'm very grateful for that definitely and I know you are exploring some really fascinating areas there at Georgia Tech today in your own lab now so is there one in particular you want to go to in a little bit more detail to tell me in our listeners about today so we have a cool project that the first part of it just finished up and got published but it's going to sort of be leading a lot of the next questions in the lab and this really worked on by a graduate student, Joy Putney and Rachel Cohn who was a undergraduate here and is now a graduate student at Emory and together we've set up this method to record the electrical activity that loft like a butterfly but the nocturnal version or the combustible version of loft we could wire up every muscle that controls the primary movements of the wings and the loft so we could tap in and try and listen to the electrical activity and nearly complete recording of the electrical activity that the month's brain gets descend to its wings while it's clapping and that was a really interesting new technique for us to develop because in neuroscience it's very common to record from many many different signals at the same time the electrical activity of many nerves or many muscles but it's usually only a small fraction of what's involved in creating a movement because even in an insect there can be hundreds of thousands of neurons and dozens and dozens of muscles but here because all the muscles that control the wing are actually in the body they're not out in the wing the wing is a flexible membrane that sticks out the protrudes from the body of the loft it was much more feasible to sort of go in and try and get a nearly complete set of recordings of all of those muscles so that was the technique and insight and it's actually something that I've been trying at different times with different people over about the last eight years to sort of develop and we finally got with joy and Rachel it's a really good recording from all of these muscle simultaneously and what it showed up that was sort of unexpected is that it showed us that during maneuvers like when the animal would try to turn it's not just that they have a single turning muscle you might expect they just sort of have a muscle that pulls the wing in one direction on one side in terms the animal left or right and if the animal wants to turn harder it just increases the activation to that muscle sort of like a little throttle or like a rudder or something yeah right right instead it turns out that every muscle is involved in every maneuver that we recorded and that every muscle is primarily changing its activation the moth's brain is controlling those muscles not by cranking up and down the activation it does that somewhat so each muscle sort of has an outline but what the brain is really doing to do most of the control is it's very precisely laying out a pattern of individual spikes of activity and it's orchestrating this movement across many muscles so I should step back for a minute and say that neurons and muscles are typically activated by little pulses of electrical activity that we call action potentials and you can think of them as actual like digital events they're sort of on or off so if you actually you can record electrically from a muscle or a nerve and if you put that recording into a speaker and you listen to a little sound and those are those little bursts of activity those little pulses of activity frequently the way that we think that motor systems work that how animals control motor systems is that when you have a muscle or a nerve that's controlling a muscle or even a neuron higher up in the brain that's controlling movement that you would increase or decrease the number of those pulses so you go from pop pop pop pop to pop pop pop and that that would produce then or force in the muscle and produce a turn through that rendering but instead what we found is that all of these muscles and we had hints that this was true in individual muscles before but it was really surprising to us that all of these muscles it's not so much the increase in the number of those pulses but it's the precise patterning and timing and in fact every muscle is controlled by the month's brain to have those precise pops those precise digital events time down to a thousandth of a second so the month is creating this orchestra of activations across this large set of muscles to execute each of its behaviors and to me this is really really fascinating because if you look at the behavioral level sometimes from a sort of physics perspective we can describe the movement of the animal with actually pretty simple dynamics models we can't capture everything the month does but a lot of times when the month is turning or moving to the air we can use very simple physics models to describe how the month is responding to stimuli and how it's turning and how it's tracking moving flowers in its environment as it's trying to feed but underlying that is an extraordinary complexity I always get really excited by science projects that sort of give a new insight but also then pose really challenging questions and for me the really challenging question that this project posed and that our lab is going after now is how is all of this complexity put together to produce a movement that is oftentimes very elegant and for a physicist that sometimes means elegant in the sense that I can describe it with a relatively simple set of equations so the movement seems to be simple in some ways whereas the underlying physiology is of course complex and I think we need to try and understand how that complex is but together what are the principles by which all of those muscles are being orchestrated by the brain and how is that precise timing of the individual's likes being set up by the brain which we thought for a long time that is very hard for nervous systems to set up very precise timing of action potentials and those little spikes in motor control in sensory systems we've known that we can really precisely encode information about our world but it's not after it sort of passed through many stages of neural processing and went to the output to the muscles that would have to be less precise and we're finding that that doesn't seem to be the chase well this is fascinating and you've hinted a little bit at just some of the challenges that come along with the complexity of this kind of work that you do but also in science in general throughout our conversation and I love talking about the challenges the struggles because I think people don't often hear these stories so Simon do you have a particular challenge that you're facing right now in the lab or just a difficult time in your career that you can tell me in our listeners about and how you work through it? I think this is really really important to acknowledge and it sort of goes back to something that I said a little bit earlier that quote from Isaac Asmolth that's funny because that being a very exciting word it's also very frustrating time because if things aren't conforming to your expectations then it can be very challenging how you're thinking about your problem and I think that that has happened a few times before to me where I've sort of taken a data set that I spent maybe months collecting experimentally and then I started analyzing it and I thought oh I might have even seen some patterns in the data that I thought would hold up when I looked across the data more rigorously after the experiments were done and then I did the analysis and those patterns weren't there and I was very confused and so an example like this was actually early on I had done a project back when I was a post-op to look for just in a single pair of muscles we had some suspicions because of how the muscle produces force that this precise timing might be there and I wanted to go in and look to see if the moth brain could precisely modulate the timing of activation to one of these muscles and I did the whole experiment where we sort of built a little flight arena for the moth tethered it in there attached it to a torque meter that would have measured the forces then torque set it would produce as it was trying to fly created a little movie screen for it and like that watched a very exciting movie of bars moving back and forth on the screen to get it to turn left and right and they put these silver wires into the muscles to record the electrical activity from them and I spent quite a number of months getting all this data and then I started to analyze it and I couldn't find any coherent pattern how the muscle was being modulated oh no I was really frustrated because I could even hear it I thought when I was listening to the electrical activity I thought I could hear it being modulated but of course you have to be very careful with that kind of subjective take on the data you have to back it up with an analysis that actually shows that that's there so I was very frustrated for a number of months trying to go through that data and it turns out that the real story was the things were way more precise than I even thought they could be that the timing was so precise it was being modulated but less than a millisecond my son of thousand for the second and the way I was analyzing the data wasn't careful enough basically I was just using standard ways that we detect when those spikes occur but if you do that without a lot of care then you can actually introduce variation into the data because you'll detect different parts of the spikes and the spikes themselves are a millisecond wide so if I'm just second to rising edge of one of the spikes in the falling edge of another one of the spike then I can introduce variation into the data that I wasn't intending that well mess up the patterns that I was looking for so eventually I realized we had to go back and develop some ways to much more precisely detect when those spikes occurred and when we did that all the sudden the patterns emerged but at first I didn't believe that that could be the case because the timing change was so precise that I didn't think that had any impact on the movement of the animals but I went back and looked a little bit more at how the muscles work and it turns out that those muscles are very specially tuned such that they're very responsive to timing changes and much more so than a lot of muscles are so the story then started to make a little bit more sense to me and then we sort of followed that up with an experiment where we actually went in and because all of these are little electrical signals you could actually replay the electrical activity into the muscles and change the timing of those spikes by stimulating the muscles and we found that by putting in a small change in the timing you've actually induced the mall to turn so we sort of did that follow up experiment to make sure that was but along the way there was a lot of frustration about the fact that the data wasn't conforming to what I was expecting it to do so but it really held a sort of deeper story underneath that just took some time to unravel. Absolutely and I liked that this story had a happy ending Simon because we loved celebrating the successes in science particularly if there's a lot of toil and struggle leading up to it so I do want to make sure we have time to chat about some of your successes as well. Do you have a favorite success story you'd like to share? I think we can go back to a number of different stories in a scientist's career, a thing that's that have been successful but let me pick a really recent one because I think it also reflects some of the challenge and difficulty in science. So this is a story about working with my graduate student, Trotus Tune, K&I and a couple of other students, Jeff Gal and a post-op, Brett Iao were at Argonne National Lab so this is a big synchrotron of particle accelerator and if you've listened to what I do, by work you might say well what does a synchroton have to do with animal locomotion? It turns out that if you take that muscle has such regularly arranged little molecular motors and that produce the force that muscle creates at the macroscopic scale that if you take an animal's muscle and you shoot high energy x-rays through it that x-rays will scatter like the classic two-slip diffraction experiment in physics and you'll get a pattern of light spots that reflect the underlying molecular structure of the muscle. So Travis has been doing these really hard experiments where we simultaneously try and measure the forces that the muscles are producing and shoot the high energy x-rays through the muscle so that we can see what's happening at the molecular scale at the same time and we do this all at a thousand frames a second to try and get sort of high speed resolution movies of how does molecular changes inside the muscle relate to the forces. So that's what's supposed to happen. That's not what always happens and it's always very fun but very stressful when you go to Argonne National Lab for the advanced photon source to do these experiments because you get a grant for time not for money but for time on the x-ray beam and you're given maybe three or four days to do your experiments and it's quite competitive to get the time and it's very valuable time. They cost quite a bit of money to run that beam every day so you really need to try and take advantage of it while we're there and we had this very cool experiment set up that we really wanted to collect data on and it was a really important experiment for Travis too because it was the sort of last experiment that he needed to complete and get all the data for his dissertation. So we went to Argonne and we were using moth muscles. These muscles that control the flight, the ones that have the precise timing that I was just talking about. So you ship the muscles and cools off environment and you get them to the beam and then you prep them and stick them in the beam and activate them and measure their forces and we've done this a few times before. Travis and I were pretty confident that we could get this experiment to work and we started the experiment and the first muscle that we put up we got actually a little bit of pretty good data so we were really excited and then we put the second muscle up and we didn't get anything. Then we put the third muscle up and we didn't get anything and then we put the fourth muscle up and we started to measure forces and the forces started going all over the place and we couldn't figure out what was going on. We thought that something was wrong with our crew and that and over the next two days Travis prepped I think 20 muscle preparations each of which takes about an hour hour and a half to do and none of them worked and we tore apart every piece of our rig. We had tested all the equipment before we came and everything was working fine and we couldn't figure out what was going on. It wasn't even consistent what the problem was it's not like we were getting no force or that we weren't activating the muscle sometimes they would activate. Sometimes they wouldn't couldn't figure out what was going on. We were getting really stressed because we were running out of time. We really needed this data set and we only brought a certain number of specimens with us and they weren't working and we finally concluded after about two days working 18 hours a day and sleeping for like four to six hours that all of the muscles that we had brought had died and transit and basically something had happened in transit. They probably got too cold or too hot and because it's sensitive physiological tissue they just basically all had lost their viability. We realized that we had sort of been spending two days working with muscle that had already been damaged and that we couldn't get anything out of. So we were extremely frustrated because we had two days left and I think the good lesson here is when you're really frustrated with something like that ask for help. I got on the phone with my former post-doc advisor who had some of the same kinds of bonds that we used and said help all of the muscles that we brought are dead and not working. We don't have any more back at the lab, back in Atlanta that we can prep and send up and he got a couple of people together in Washington and they prepped up a bunch of muscles for us and sent us the muscles overnight. The wind and slept for about 10 hours while the muscles were in transit to our national lab. We went out to the UPS store got the box, showed back up we had 36 hours to try and finish and collect all this data and I had to leave after 10 hours because I had to come back to Atlanta for a meeting. So we got some data out of it and we finally all of a sudden immediately everything started to work once we had did muscle and then I had to go which is very stressful for me too and Travis and Jeff who were the only two left at that point in time did like 12 hour and a half long preparations of the next 30 hours and were able to get a really nice data set out of it. So that was a really big success but it was a really big success that had an extraordinarily frustrating and very stressful time in the middle of it. It's almost more rewarding I think when there's a lot of struggle leading up to it you can appreciate the success more. I can't be up but I think Travis and I could have both done with a little less struggle on the way of that one. That's true. That's true. Well we've talked about a lot of different experiences you've had over the course of your career some of the UPS and downs. I'm going to dive outside of science for a moment to talk a little bit about what you're reading and books that you've enjoyed over the years because me and our listeners love getting book recommendations to add to our own reading lists. So Simon do you have a favorite book whether it's related to science or not that you'd like to tell us about today? I have one book that's an unusual book that I think I really want to recommend and it's especially a good book for kids but it's one of these books that's for kids but probably is at least as informative for adults. So if any of your listeners have kids this isn't science related I just think it's a very beautiful commentary on how the world works and what we value. So the book is called Mumble M-O-M-O and it's by Michael Enda who's the author of an ever-ending story and I don't want to spoil it but the book is about a very unusual girl who doesn't speak but is very very good at listening and the drama and story in the book is about what happens when a bunch of men and grey show up to this little girl's town and start trying to convince everybody in the town to invest their spare time in the time savings bank where it will be returned to them with interest later on and it's a very interesting story about how we sometimes try to live our lives very efficiently and effectively and how we sometimes feel like idle hands are the work of the devil and that kind of attitude and it celebrates the role of play and time and listening and just having a different perspective on the world and I think it also shows that how people who are very different from the other folks around them can have very valuable insights that can sometimes be really important to saving us from ourselves. So I think that that's the book I must recommend. On the science side I very much like science fiction so there's the foundation series by Isaac Asimov especially in this sort of world of data sciences today reading about Asimov's perspective on psychosis and how you can use data to try and predict the future is I think very interesting if anyone reads that story make sure you get to the second book in Matrilogy. The real interesting part for me is when the character the mule first appears and I think that that's a very interesting story that everybody should read these days and for sort of more fantastical science fiction and world building I really like SevenSense books especially Diamond Age and for just a totally different novel with an international perspective I really think everybody should read a fine balance by Rowington Mystery is an Indian author who wrote a very interesting character study that took place in the emergency period in India and it has some just really interesting characters in it. It's also a very emotionally difficult book to get through. Gotcha. Well wonderful recommendations Simon we will add these to our website for our listeners to find there and we've talked about different aspects of your career but one thing we haven't really gone into detail on are some of the opportunities you've had to travel for science so do you have a favorite place or the most memorable place that science has taken you that you can tell us about today. Well I think that one just happened over this past summer so I just went to India both to visit a colleague at the National Center for Biological Sciences Sanjay Sane and Professor Sane and his lab sort of posted to me there for several days and I had a really fun time hanging out there they have this space where they do science where they have about 200 acres of jungle in the middle of Bangalore actually in the northern part of Bangalore but near enough to Bangalore that it's unusual to have that much green space set aside from the bus stop of the city and I just spent a number of days there doing science with them having a very pleasant time but then afterwards I went to a region of a southern part of India where Tibetan monks in exile have monastery and the Dalai Lama there is set up a program through Emory to teach neuroscience and incorporate neuroscience physics and biology into the monastic education curriculum so with a number of other faculty members through this exchange program I taught neuroscience to Tibetan monks for a couple of weeks and that was really really interesting because just the difference perspective and background that they had was really different they didn't have the same sort of formal mathematical training that we had and the idea of empirical evidence was very different from their ways of investigating how their minds worked which was more of a subjective investigation but each of those monks does four hours of debate practice six days a week for 16 years so they're really good at asking hard questions and I just had a really fun time hanging out with them and trying to communicate my interest in neuroscience and the cool things I find about science and how it works to people who had a very different perspective in background but shared a love of trying to understand the mind and the brain and how that operates. Well Simon this sounds like an amazing experience and one of the things that makes science phenomenal are some of these people that you get to interact with some of these opportunities you have to work with people across cultures, across countries and across the world and I think this often goes contrary to the stereotypes that people have about what scientists lives are like and some of the things that you get to do and I think oftentimes there are stereotypes as well about scientists themselves we're seeing is very critical very serious all the time sort of people and that's often not the case so we love showcasing the human side of science by just talking about some of these great experiences you have a quirky traditions and fun memories you shared so do you have an example you can share with us today? I think one of the best examples of that is the first rule of Svondruglaub the first rule of my lab that my graduate students and I came up with and the first rule of my lab and you can ask anyone in my lab is don't trust Simon it's been both in a humorous way and in a serious way it's sort of the serious way first it means don't trust me to do your science for you if I have a perspective on what the scientific literature says I may be wrong and I may be missing things and it's very important to be critical and think about the science and formulate your own ideas and your own vision yourself and not just follow along what's going on but it also means that sometimes I'm a little mischievous and sometimes I have a trisens of humor and I like to play word games and such so sometimes you just shouldn't trust me because I may be choking around and one example of that is when I was in my postdoc this is around the time when our greenos were becoming really popular these electronic kits that you can build little sensors and detectors of Tom Daniel my postdoc advisor had a map computer and they old math laptops had little remote controls with them and it turns out those remote controls just flashed a little pattern of IR lights of infrared lights at the computer but the pattern was the same for all computers so we got a little infrared LED and attached it to a little wireless electronic chip and we took a three-ring binder and drilled a little hole a lot of the side and put the little IR lights so that it would stick out and put the little wireless transmitter in the pocket of the binder and put it up on his shelf so with that we could wirelessly control his computer from the other room which led to all kinds of fun so we sort of slow played it over the next week and occasionally we would just start playing jazz or something on his computer and turn up the volume and we would always do it whenever somebody was walking into his room so he always thought that somebody in his the person walking into his room had like some kind of room up control so he started panning down and probably came into his room trying to figure out where the remote control was so it gets serious again science has sort of done this community especially in the academic setting where we have a set of students and postdocs and faculty members and I think one of the best things is that a lot of the times that environment can start feeling very collaborative and collegial where everybody respects each other's opinions it can be very important and the contributions that they can make and sort of creating that community around which science is done is one of the things that I enjoy the most about the science that I get to do and the people that I get to work with it's one of the reasons I'm in academia because I feel like we really get to create and have this community surround us and it really is what pushes me to think differently and frankly that will by lab don't trust sign and it's good advice for me too sometimes I shouldn't trust myself to think that I have the right perspective on things so maybe it's a little bit of a cold arms as well as that just be careful because I like to joke around a bit. So certainly well I like this role and I really like that you're able to bring a sense of humor and creativity into the lab because I think creativity is essential for solving some of these huge problems that science faces today so Simon if we gave you all of the resources you could dream of funding staff technology whatever you need what is the one question you would most want to answer. I think resources is what key abilities they enable rather than what specific question they answer because a lot of times I think a single question can be answered in a lot of different creative ways so I'll answer that question in about a specific question in a second but if we're really talking about resources and people I think the thing that I would most like to see is I would like to see all the really cool tools that are being developed in specific animal systems like the really advanced genetic techniques that flies and some of the really cool behavioral techniques that you can do in rodent behavior and neuroscience and some of the ways that we can do training and such in human neuroscience I would really like to see those tools and techniques be broadly applicable across many different animals because I think one of the cool things about studying organismal biology is that there are many many animals who have solved problems about neuroscience and biomechanics in very different ways but with some convergent principles and that really what we want to do is try to understand not how one particular animal goes about solving its problem that may be useful especially if it's exceptionally good at like I'll get those stick walls but especially when we get to the neuroscience side of things we really understand how neural systems in general are organized such that they can execute these wasteful movements that we appreciate in the world and in order to do that I think we need to have a lot of access to these systems in different kinds of animals where we can look at what is common and what is different what is invariant and what is special and specific about each of these different systems so I would really like to see a cross fertilization of tools across systems and I think that that's very challenging so I think the key idea there is that the people that are doing the science need to develop their scientific questions but in terms of the technical expertise of people having more of that what that creates is the capacity to answer questions and the capabilities that we have it's not the question of itself I think the question that I would most like to answer is a high level question of how do we filter out the relevant information from all of the thousands of sensors that we have that we then can transform that into a way that we can then use an effective way to move around the world that's the high level vision science question a more concrete question is just how the heck to flying insects stay aloft that's really hard we sort of understand the basic aerodynamics principles we understand some of how they control the movement but it's still really challenging to dynamically unstable behavior that we describe in physics which means that if the little insects brain it's not continuously sort of taking information and updating how it controls its body it's going to fall into the sky within a few wingstrokes and yet these insects negotiate really windy blustery turbulent environments they do it in all kinds of different lighting conditions moths can slow their brain down so they can see flowers and track the movement of flowers and turn in mid air 20 times a second they can all do it in light levels where you wouldn't be able to see the hand in front of your face so trying to understand how all these various elaborate sensory motor agile skills are implemented in something that is so small as an insect I don't like to say that they're simple because they're still extraordinarily complex especially if I'm a physicist perspective but they have these amazing behavior or effort for ours and it seems like a very interesting system to study definitely well Simon you've shared some great insights and ideas with me and our listeners today and there's one last thing that we'll ask for and that is advice so what is the best advice you've ever been given I think maybe the best advice that I've been given is to think about what you do is loading with your career as saying that from a science perspective the most valuable thing we have is how we invest our time and our intellectual energy so whatever problems you feel the most challenging and interesting and most need to be addressed you should cope with your career use push your career in that direction so I think that's the highest level advice that I've got and that's really good but the other part of it is to try and find an environment and this is easy to say in the hard to do and we don't always have the opportunities to do this but try and find an environment where you're inspired by the people around you and find this sort of environment in which where you're sort of going to be set up to succeed where the kinds of questions that you want to go after can be appreciated and I appreciate how hard that is that's not an easy thing to create many of us aren't given that opportunity to find that place and it's one of the things that I work the most with the students I'm trying to figure out what that is and where it might be I've been very fortunate to have a great set of colleagues and people around me who have that support for me but there's definitely been times in my career where I felt very challenged in that way. Well this is outstanding advice Simon is there any other last piece of advice or a last message that you want to leave me and our listeners with today? I think for the scientists especially the early career scientists many projects that you work on will hit a stage probably very near the end where everything suddenly seems to go apart and everything seems like it might collapse around you and that usually happens when there's sort of a piece in the data that doesn't fit with the story that you've started to develop and as I mentioned before and told some stories about that's a really difficult time but it's also a time that usually perils new stories to come and I think keeping up your motivation and having some confidence and having some belief in the process of science rather than in the state of science that the scientific process will lead you to a new insights into that story and potentially even more interesting things when that happens many of us have faced those challenges I think all of us but I don't want to speak for everyone but I know many of us certainly myself have faced those times where it feels really really frustrating and it makes you question your value as a scientist and your capabilities as a scientist but it's definitely those are the hardest times to push through but they also sometimes lead to the coolest new ideas and insights. Well Simon an important message to pass on to our listeners if they are interested in your research or your work and they want to learn more about you what's the best way for them to do so or to get in touch? The best way to get in touch with me would be to use my email which is my last name's Sponberg at gatek.edu searchatek.edu you can also find me on my website which is www.sponberg.govitek.edu or just Google my name the nice thing about having a rather unique class name is there's not very many other Simon Sponbergs so if you Google my name you'll find my website also on twitter at Simon.sponberg and you can tweet at me. Fantastic well listeners definitely check out Simon's website get in touch if you have any questions and Simon it's been such a pleasure to have you on the show today. Thank you it's been great and listeners wonderful to have you here as well we'll see you next time on another episode of People Behind the Science
