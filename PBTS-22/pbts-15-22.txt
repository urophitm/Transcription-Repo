And of course, as always, you can send us email to contact at peoplebehindtheScience.com if you have any questions, comments, or if there's anything else you'd like to send our way. Now listeners, I'm looking forward to sharing my conversation with Satesh. So I hope that you're ready to meet another one of our outstanding people behind the science. Every day, discoveries are made that will change our understanding of the world around us. Dr. Marie McNally is here to bring you the brilliant minds who are making these discoveries so they can share their incredible stories and take you on an amazing journey. Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the People Behind the Science podcast. Today, I am delighted to introduce you to our guest scientist, Dr. Satesh Badezi. So Satesh, welcome to our show today. How are you? Thank you very much for having me. I'm doing well and I hope that you and everyone listening is also doing well. I'm doing well myself and I'm looking forward to sharing some of your stories, your experiences, and your insights with our listeners today. But before we jump into those details, I want to take a moment to give them a little bit of background. So listeners, Satesh is a professor of public health and preventative medicine, as well as assistant dean for graduate studies at St. George's University in Grenada. He's also an adjunct professor in the Center for Global Health at Old Dominion University and a visiting professor at Chakkaara University in India, as well as Cassett Start University in Thailand. Satesh received his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus, a master of science degree in public health from St. George's University and a doctor of education degree from the University of Sheffield. Now, prior to joining the faculty there at St. George's University, Satesh held a position at the University of Trinidad in Tobago, as well as at the Ministry of Health in Trinidad in Tobago. Satesh is a fellow of the Royal Society of Public Health, the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine in Hygiene, the International Society on Infectious Diseases, and also the Society of Biology, as well as Board Certified by the United States National Board of Public Health Examiners. An inner interview today, Satesh is going to share some of his experiences both in life and in science, so Satesh, we're looking forward to getting to know you both as a scientist and also just in general as a person, so can you start by telling us how you like to spend your time when you're not doing science? Besides work, my childhood passion and what I've been able to enjoy throughout my life and the start is aviation. I have an interest in aircrafts, I love flying, privately of course, and I enjoy particularly flying in the Caribbean region. Excellent, so how did you get into aviation? Well, my uncle was a pilot and as a kid, there was some interest, I believe, where he would take me flying with a small, says no one's having to aircraft, and that experience just got me very comfortable in the air, but also I was able to appreciate the fact that aviation is a privilege, which I'm thankful for, and one that I sort of had my eyes on while even engaging science. So somehow I never lost track of that aviation interest, so what a pursuit science on my career, I continued to explore the interest and when the time came, received my license and certification and I could do to fly as a hobby. Very cool, so how long have you had your pilot's license? For almost a decade now. Oh wow, so you've got quite a few flights under your belt, right? That's right. Awesome, well great to hear a little bit more about some of your passions outside the world of science, but I would love to talk about your research next. So Satish, can you tell us how you describe what you do to someone who is maybe not familiar with your field? Well, my positionality in public health and public health research is that human health is inextricably linked with the environment, and from that position, I tend to identify factors in the environment that influence human health both in a positive way as well as a negative way. Very interesting, and I know you do a wide variety of research projects within the work that you're doing, and I'm looking forward to chatting more about those as we go through our interview. But I would love to chat a little bit first about what motivates you. I think, as a scientist, there's a lot on the to-do list most of the time, so I'm always looking for a little bits of motivation and sayings and quotes that can help me throughout my day. Do you have a favorite one of yours? What comes to my mind is a quote that I would love to hear this quote from my grandparents days, ongoing life. They would have reminded me of it a bit prior to time. It's and essentially it suggests that what you can do tomorrow, do today, and what you can do today, do it now. The idea is a time is precious, and tomorrow is never promised. So what you can focus on in the present time, that's the only time that you have to really get your tasks done or achieve and if you get a dream or aspiration you may have. Well, Catech, I love that quote, and I must say procrastination is something that I am very guilty of. Oftentimes, it's so tempting and so easy to just kind of keep putting things off till tomorrow. So what helps you prevent that procrastination? I think it might have been my life experiences as a teenager. I lost my mom in a vehicle accident, and that was a traumatic experience in me. I'd also appreciated the fragility of life, and then I also was very injured during a time when I had to recover as well. And also some years ago I was diagnosed and has since recovered from testicular cancer as well. Oh wow. And these experiences have encouraged me to really value time, really value life. So when I think about the tasks I have, when I think about the time I have, it reduces the likelihood of me procrastinating. Definitely. Well, thank you for sharing some of these major life experiences that have kind of shaped the person you are today and how you approach life. And I think listeners, this is an important message. Seize the day. Don't keep putting things off till tomorrow because you never know how many tomorrow's you've got in the bucket. I'm curious now that we've heard a little bit about what inspires you to hear more about who inspires you. So, Satesh, are there people who really rise up in your mind as inspirational figures or maybe mentors who had a big impact on you? My mom was probably one of my biggest and my biggest mentor, especially in influencing my scientific inquiry and interests. And this is so much how the things, as a four five year kid I remember, with my mom, I got to know it was an entomology. And the work she was focused on was controlling a milliburg of fungus for plants, which affected both food crops and botanicals. And her work included examining biological control for the milliburg. So, the user ladybird to control the milliburg and eventually they also used a wash to control the ladybird and that entire experience fascinated me. It fascinated me in terms of the fieldwork examining sites where the milliburg was proliferating and then releasing these biological agents in an effort to control them and eventually the project was quite successful. So, that experience really got me interested in the ability to use science to solve problems. It also inculcated my mind, my own ability to ask questions. So, somehow I assumed a persona where people began referring to ask questions. So, this idea of asking questions emerged from that least experiences with my mom. And in the Caribbean islands a lot of our activities include farming and our cultural communities. So, my questions also was involving the practice of our culture when it's food crops with this animal production. So, I would apply these questions to persons that I was encountering on a routine basis, which included farmers who were farming animals, for example, why are animals having diseases, why are some growing faster than others, for example? Why are they eating what they're eating? And all these questions allowed me to develop an alternative of natural world. And this encouraged me to learn more and the knowledge that I was learning along the way I began to really identify that knowledge as a result of science. So, that's somehow developed my inquiry, developed my interests and of course my projected path in the area of science. Absolutely. So, I'm curious, I'd say, is it a taste to do ever consider pursuing the science of entomology or maybe the science of aviation in flight? Well, the aviation was always a passion. In the Caribbean there is very limited school for major careers in aviation beyond the local and regional airlines and they are very limited in things of their own capacity as well. So, I never necessarily saw aviation as a sustainable park with itself, but science certainly is well accepted and we do have many institutions and organizations of higher education and science, whether it's governmental agencies or private industry as well. So, science seemed at that time a more sustainable approach towards a career. Gotcha. So, can you tell us a little bit about how you went from this curious kid asking tons of questions it sounds like, to where you are today? What are some of these key moments that took you to where you are now? So, in high school, we were exposed to the various that was the opposite areas from mathematics, the language, the science, the history, the geography, the computer science, the liberal arts, we were exposed. But I believe some of the main recollections that I have for my high school days were experiences in the laboratory for example, like dissecting a frog and observing the heart of the frog at least, though contracting while we completely rendered the animal dead and even the questions and goals and recognizance be hard at self, the hard muscle tissue, it has a life only marked death and things of being myotonic and understand that context. So, that experience would have really fostered my interest in biology and that event allowed me to think about the biology of discipline and the way we package science subjects together in the Caribbean, that you have to take one as a group. So, biology always was a group with chemistry, physics, mathematics, then I decided to put a group of subjects in your sciences and then we look from high school and at that time as a middle-aged teenager thinking about career choices, reflecting on my experiences with my mother and my mother passed away at that time and that as a part of honoring her memory and her life may have given me a value association with sort of pursuing a part in zoology and that zoology interests then was expanded and explored further in the irreventile medicine looking at all aspects of animal health from an acrometer zoology and everything in between and in veterinary medicine as I began to study and practice veterinary medicine I got involved in food safety issues I got involved in understanding the linkage between humans and animals and the positive bonds that exist by a companionship for example and that really got me interested in public health. Sometimes for example in veterinary medicine we will synchronize issues and that the idea is for all of these animals to present on heat collectively so they can be fertilized as a group they can be processed as a group of production purposes as well we work with companion animals and the idea is to promote the well-being of the animals but at the same time you're also advocating for human well-being because humans are getting close to animals having companionship with animals promotes stress management it increases healthy lifestyles because you're exercising with your animals as well so that took me to public health it took me to really exploring more how we can support the human animal bond as well as mitigate the risk factors that animals may cause the humans especially from food safety issues or infectious diseases and then when I got into public health now I realized that in human health in general we know what the problems are and we know what the solutions are but the gap is in effecting adequate behavior and when I studied behavior I'm trying to see how I can influence and encourage behavior I came across the social sciences and the social scientists speak about knowledge attitudes perceptions KAP and how that translates into behavior in that people behave based on how they perceive something based on the attitude towards that and your perception and your attitude is a function of your knowledge of your understanding so I tried then to intervene in informing behaviors by influencing actions and perceptions through education that then led me to consider learning about the science and the methodologies and the competence that's involved in education as well so my education my tree interprefied from veterinary medicine to public health education and I see that as the tools that I need to understand the risk factors that affect human health and then intervene whether these interventions are clinically whether they are environmentally whether they are behaving absolutely well it's been wonderful to hear almost the train of thought that led from one step to the next along your career path and I think in hindsight it's easy to make things sound like everything went smoothly and it was all very logical how you were making these different transitions but was it difficult for you to decide to go back for this sort of second and third in many cases terminal degrees it's difficult for one extent because the difficulty lies in the efforts and the time and the examination and the thesis and the defense right so that was a difficult part but in spite of the difficulty the ambition and the interest in getting to a point that you feel will be valuable to you so intentionally that would have provided any particular physical that I may have to see. Definitely well I absolutely admire your determination to secure this additional training beyond that initial veterinary degree and I think for me it was hard enough to go through my dissertation once I couldn't imagine doing three different ones I'm quite impressed and we've talked about the different steps that took you to your career today but I'd love to talk next about one of these projects you're working on I know you're kind of working on everything from public health to infectious disease to food safety and you mentioned a couple different areas what is something that's ongoing right now in your lab that you are just the most excited about. Just before I joined this conversation with you I was speaking with some of my research colleagues about a study and re-conducting right known as on Dengue. Now Dengue virus it's known it's established Dengue is in Dengue in the tropical region and even including sub-tropical regions and more than 50% of the world's population is at risk of exposure but we know a lot about Dengue but there's some aspect that we're not familiar with one of the aspects that we consider knowledge of the app so was probably affecting treatment and understanding the pathologist disease is exploring Dengue exposure in people who do not come from Dengue and Dengue regions that means mostly studies done on Dengue usually happen with Dengue exists and that makes sense but we have an opportunity here at St George's University where our students come from past the world including non-endemic areas so recently as in the past three weeks we have been working with students who are not exposed to Dengue and they are now in Grenada for the first time in an endemic region and they are being exposed so we are exploring the immune response to Dengue of persons who are being exposed to the first time and that response will sort of help us to understand the population characteristics of Dengue for example in the endemic region of Dengue less than 20% of persons that develop clinical science are actually presenting themselves clinically that means that over 80% of persons that are exposed to Dengue do not have clinical science that's one aspect so we try to figure out what will be the immuneoglobulin response and also what are the types, these different stereotypes that involve and the different stereotypes are providing different immune responses and reactions to the bodies but restarting more first of all with persons who have never been exposed before and we hope that we will learn more about the immune response we hope that we will also figure out for those that are exposed what does that mean in terms of the different types of Dengue will they be exposed to multiple types will they have different percentages of clinical symptoms based on these exposures and see how that reflects into areas in the world in which the endemic status is known because everything we know about Dengue is based on populations that are already exposed and with people traveling around the world now we will have people who are not exposed being exposed over time so we will try to learn more about Dengue in terms of the immunological naive populations that exist well this is fascinating and sort of an angle of the question of infectious disease that I hadn't really considered looking at these origins from endemic or nonendemic regions and that initial exposure so I guess the question for me is does it stop at Dengue or do you have other diseases lined up in the pipeline to come next well always when you think about vector more diseases that are infected or that the usage spreads then give her also the eighties of type mosquito and with that vector they also spread other infectious diseases so in the past we would have had outbreaks of Zika virus which you can go near virus spread by these infectious ones and while these viruses are not currently circulating in the regional population we have other diseases in the horizon I'm concerned about we have or a push virus we have myarovirus which isn't South America and it's also spread by the age of type mosquito we also have cyclical episodes of yellow fever as well so these are other sort of possibilities that make coincide with the vector and also with the dengue epidemic and endemic status that exists in the Caribbean regions of tropical regions in the world so it's important for us to really appreciate and get an understanding of dengue because while other infectious disease have come and gone dengue persists well thanks for sharing more about this current project very cool we're going on in your lab and we've talked about a lot of the great aspects of your career so far cetace but I think we haven't yet touched on a lot of the struggles and the challenges whether they're big failure moments or just these kind of day-to-day grind so do you have a favorite failure or challenge or struggle that you faced in your career that you can share with us and maybe walk through how you got through it there's always fear because there's always struggles of course I have many examples but there's one that always sort of evokes my memory and my emotions when I think about some of the struggles that I've had in dear research so in Grenadow we have a partnership with the nutmeg industry and Grenadow is very well known to nutmeg it's going through this spice island as well and that's primary as result of nutmeg production now nutmeg is very much synonymous with Grenadow but we had some difficulty after hurricane Ivan 2004 and that new production dropped but currently Grenadow is it did largest produce of nutmeg in the world oh wow for a small island that's quite substantial now my role in the nutmeg industry is working with nutmeg workers themselves especially the processing workers these are workers who receive the roll nutmegs and then the process is that makes the market so it involves drying up makes it involves different aspects of tight nutmeg sorting up makes out as well and preserving them for shipment now when you take a product like roll nutmeg in a tropical environment and you dry that nutmeg you also attract some mold growth in the nutmegs and with this mold the breathing creates a lot of dust so when we conduct and how the system of workers workers were complaining of poor snazel drip upper respiratory distress sinusitis which is consistent with some type of airborne exposure and we made the link between the workers respiratory distress and the presence in the environment and exposure potential of the dust from the mold growth and nutmegs coming out of that we worked with injuries and we were able to identify a potential solution which was solid dehydration so we converted one of those shipping cow containers into a solid dehydrator we got a fund to really develop this project we had a pilot study festival and the pilot study demonstrated that our solar technology would reduce the time it takes to dry nutmegs by half the time so production and processing will be faster and secondly when you can find the nutmegs in a solid dehydrator you're essentially preventing mold growth by controlling humidity etc so we thought we found a solution where we were able to reduce the time it took to process nutmegs as well as mitigate the exposure to nutmegs workers to get more than dust right when when yes well that was exciting for us but here's where the challenge when we began to install the pilot solid dehydrator on the side of the processing plant and the nutmeg workers began to look the processing device itself there was a lot of apprehensions and inertia on the part of the workers themselves and the union's going to evolve as well because there was click and zoom that the workers felt threatened and challenged that they would be replaced by these solid dehydrators themselves and that led to a lot of use for these solid dehydrated well the initial solid dehydrated that we implemented we worked with management of course of management were very excited about this and we had all the data and events to show for it and we were keen on preventing the stress risk rates just in workers but we had a lot of reservations in the father workers and up to today that intervention was and is not accepted on the part of the workers so here we have the entire problem work towards solution but because of challenges in terms of workers acceptance which I appreciate and I accept we were able to fully translate our science meaningful outcomes for these workers that remains a period on a point in time in my scientific life where I found solutions and it's difficult to apply the solution so that is very disgusting thing for me absolutely well thanks for sharing the story and I think it comes back to some of the elements of your training kind of getting back to the behavior change and the education and just the implementation of some of these programs like you said you found a solution it so tantalizingly close to being realized but there's some resistance and I think that is something where you really have to get in there in the community and understand what the resistance is and help work through some of those challenges so what was that process like? Well what we tried to do was really focus on the health and safety of workers so we did some work so on training with these workers get them to become more aware change at some perception because we want to acknowledge change at the perceptions and informed behavior so we worked to develop a quality of health and safety and identifying strategies based on identify risk factors in the particular processing plant the workers we believe appreciated it but these workers themselves that their skills that the community in which a person can't belong to that to be used so not most of them are being possessed so there was a lot of cultural traditional social type of institutionalization then of the traditional not being processing practices itself and as much as we could within our own limitations it would have taken changing the culture and society of our community and that I think would have been an overwhelming task on all parts so we accept and we appreciate it the difficulties in implementing the technology and the techniques that that we propose so based on that we continue to have a partnership with the workers themselves we continue to monitor the health of course we try to identify ways including personal protective equipment try to modify the environment to an extent in terms of changing ventilation strategies as well trying to manage more and a control manner the humidity effect as well of the nutmegs itself and with the reduce as much as we can the moral growth and the workers exposure but there are still the expos of course but having said that though we are trying to find other ways in which we can reduce the adverse health effects of the moral and thus in the environment well so Teyash this is a difficult and complex conundrum you've described here so thanks for sharing it with our listeners today just to kind of show some of the difficulties that scientists face like you said you might come up with a solution but implementation is not always easy and certainly cannot happen overnight in almost all cases but we don't just want to talk about the difficulties though I'd love to hear about one of your success stories next so the Caribbean region or population is continuing to come with towards more current disease variants and while my research focus particularly in the first half of my career in my life and sciences but in primary infectious diseases that we cannot help but also engage in current disease management because the number one through five causes of mobility and mortality in the Caribbean region are current diseases okay it's your cancers it's your diabetes it's your heart disease it's your strokes for example and as a result of that the population is affected with diabetes for example and diabetes warm part of it we know how to prevent an intruder course but is it complications of diabetes that is most concerning for me what I mean by that is with diabetes you develop peripheral neuropathy you begin to lose sensation in your low limbs and extremities for example and a lot of these communities are farming communities are farmers who are affected by them so they have their feet for example in boots or their barefoot in the soil environment they get cuts and wounds and these wounds eventually develop infections become gantiness and the only solution to save their life is amputations currently great on several other Caribbean islands we are on the list of the top country that having most number of amputations put capital associated diabetes complications oh wow and that's a problem because when we explore and examine these amputies their life expectancies three to five years post amputation they receive social isolation they become unemployed they lose their income they develop further risk factors for other countries using fluently obesity they have a very poor collective life the Caribbean community from the working environment the public infrastructure is not well conducive to persons with disabilities so access to even health becomes more compromised so there is a significant problem especially among the amputee populations secondary to diabetic complications so from that perspective we try to intervene we conduct the studies looking at the trends over time of diabetics prevalence of diabetes prevalence of complications of diabetes as well as amputations we partnered with if switch university in the right of kingdom and if switch university have what they call it if switch touch to test whether use a micro filament and the micro filament is used to screen for persons with this peripheral in your upper feet or loss sensation especially in their toes and their feet now in greater in the Caribbean islands it's difficult to administer micro filaments to the community members to conduct tests on their own so what we were able to adapt and adopt on our local setting was instead of a micro filament we do a tool that we work around every day at all fingers so we developed a national campaign around world diabetes the where we educated we developed flyers we developed YouTube video clips we went to the television radio school with community centers and we assisted persons in conducting what we call a touch to test which is taking anything else but someone else has to administer test for you the person have to extend their limbs on a chair or a heightened service someone else needs to press gently on randomly selected toes for example and if there were any lack of sensation the person would not indicate by raising their hand for example so during that time we developed national campaigns and we didn't consistently around world diabetes day which occurs in the month of November and every time we do this we first of all identify suspect cases and that's around the community anyone can do to the community and if you think you're suspect come to the health center let's confirm it we consistently received over to the 300 persons that have a suspect case oh wow eventually we able to confirm about 50 of them or so that have perfect property since that time we have a cohort of persons now that we have a footcare program that we're working with and that footcare program is mentioned in the same way we wash our hands in our face every day wash your feet look after your feet examine it clean it if you have a cut or wound have that attended to immediately by health care professional so we have a quarter persons and we work with them towards their foot health we have a nice slogan love the feet you walk on for example and the idea is to have these persons never require a limb amputation as a result of their complications and as a result of any peripheral property that they already have so we want to work with them continue to work with them to prevent injuries and prevent infections and of course prevent amputations since at that time we have not had any one of our 150 persons thus that's in our cohort must single one of them have had a need for an amputation so we want to keep it that way we wouldn't have lived an extradition period of time live a productive life and not have a need for amputations and suffer the I was consequence as a result so we find a lot of benefits and a lot of success in a national community participatory project where persons in communities at least identify suspect cases which they health care providers then confirm and if they are confirmed cases we have a follow-up program for them towards their foot care and it's a wonderful opportunity for us to reduce the bleeding of peripheral property secondary to diabetes and of course have these persons continue to live productive lives which for everyone requires a use of your feet as well certainly well satish congratulations on this success i must say this idea of having the self-screening the finger toe touch test i think is awesome and it's something like you said that's way more accessible than some of the other clinical tests that are out there and it sounds like this type of program this type of campaign in intervention has the potential to have a big impact on people not only just in the Caribbean and you mentioned this collaboration with group in ip switch as this sort of something that you're looking at maybe expanding even further you see if it's to choose you we have piloted this approach even at the clinical site in the hostels oh wow and they're finding a lot of benefits and even this thing of this touch test as a basic screen is not consummatory by any means of course but it's just a basic screen to identify suspect cases which you can confirm later on that is amazing thanks so much for sharing it with me and our listeners today and we've talked about a lot of aspects of your career and i think we focused a little bit on the science and some of the work that you're doing in the lab but we've talked a little bit about your passions outside of science as well and for me one of my passions is reading so i love getting book recommendations from everyone that we feature on our program so it's a stage can you add to our book list today with either a book that you've liked that's a science-related book or a non-science related book i think i'm being want to grab it into a non-science book excellent course we're gonna see how science is like reading but i think one of the most impactful read experiences over time is really been non-science-related it's almost like a relaxation like a release sometimes to read non-science in the book and i can probably think about multiple different publications different books different reading opportunities that really highlights me when there was one particular it's more like an essay than a book to be honest with you and this essay was first given to me by my mentor and mentor at chefhyl university who gave me this essay to read even before i began working on my thesis and essentially essay was entitled on book i like it and it was written by harry g franford professor from prince and university and that book essentially tracks to provide some commentary on understanding that in life and work out there there's both all around us and you have to first of all one recognize that identified and also work with it because that is a reality and no matter what we do in science in life we have to sometimes work with it work in spite of it and that essay really began my formalized engagement with this human experience and control of book which the essay speaks about i actually have been inspired so much by this that i even shared with my students though as a tradition that's awesome and we have discussions on it because it's good for us to understand from day one that we all want to recognize what this means we all appreciate what that also suggests to our science to our life and also the development strategies towards how we can work around it sometimes so i actually would encourage persons to consider and it's free you can actually google it and you can contact me i have a pdf document but harry g franford has a website and it's all there as well so i would encourage your listeners to certainly access this resource and see if they can find value in that particular publication which i found in my life which impacts my science as well as my personal life well so tach i'm going to have to check this out i must say while our world is wonderful it is far from perfect and i think no matter where you go you're going to encounter some bs so this is something that is great for our listeners and i love that it's freely accessible so listeners definitely check this out we'll put it on our website as well so you can find it easily and we've talked about some of the different aspects of your career as a scientist and i think one of the things we've sort of hinted at are some of the opportunities that you get to travel in the work that you do in some of these adjunct appointments that you have so today's can you share with us your favorite travel memory your favorite travel moment from your career as a scientist fortunately as a result of science about how many opportunities to travel in the scientist do manage from that as well and we need that because a lot of our science science is quite universal science is repeatable is forceifiable these are the principles of science and regardless of where the world science is almost like an accepted language regardless of different cultures different languages different geographies scientists when they get together they can understand they can relate and they can collaborate so certainly traveling and interacting with people and partnering is critical in science it is really not an individual effort anymore science is really a team based approach and the team that we need our world we share problems together and we need to share solutions and share strategies together and that is only encourage supported to travel and fortunately as well for me i've been able to travel across all the continents around the world but one of my favorite places to visit and one of my favorite sites to collaborate with is cassette salt university in Sakona Konan Thailand they have a wonderful opportunity where they explore human health aspects with the environmental and animal health as well which really brings in the concept of one health from a practical perspective now Sakona Konan is a northeast province in Thailand and in that region there's a very strong agricultural presence and with agriculture there's farming there are communities there's animals and that allows for us to really see the challenges as well as opportunities to examine disease so we have been looking at paracet diseases for example in animals as a result of food safety concerns we have been looking at ways in which we can promote the whole sustainable use of land towards water quality towards towards land use and our other products for human benefit so this idea of exploring human interactions with animals in the environment have been really impressed unfortunately the partner with colleagues at kastat university for this particular purpose as well one of the specifics that i'm familiar with there is also looking at the age all disease of ravies the ravies has been written historically where humans have fatal consequences as a result of being exposed to the bite for rabbit dog for example and there is an opportunity to work especially in highly densely populated areas in Southeast Asia to manage the burden of ravies on ravies is a highly preventable disease because you can vaccinate the animal reservoirs for reviews especially the domestic dog and to vaccination trade dog control programs we can certainly place a lot of effort and they arrive a lot of benefits towards human health the cost for one mile of ravies vaccine is about 1000 and then it costs it will take to treat a case and that case you have even be treatable depending on the stage in which is presented as well that's remarkable yeah so i actually find a lot of practical applications and foreseeable benefits as a result of the one health related work that we participate in with our partners in Sakon Nakonan Thailand phenomenal so what was it about Thailand that initially drew your interest to start this collaboration well said your university is an international university and we have faculty students from 140 countries are entombed in oh wow one of the partners with us is Machino University of Thailand and we have students we have faculty we have students visit Thailand for research opportunities show the time that i've been working with St. Joseph University we have been able to meet colleagues and develop partnerships with the conferences and as a result of these discussions and collaborations the event has led to specific projects based on particular needs and interests as well well satay's awesome project and it's great to hear that you're able to really have this global presence working with people all around the world on some of the research projects that you do and i love that you touched on just how phenomenal some of these people are and these some of these collaborations that you've formed because i think the idea of science as a team sport is not something that everyone thinks about and just this idea of being able to meet wonderful people from all over the world and maybe break some of the stereotypes that people have about what scientists are like and what life as a scientist is like is phenomenal and you've already shared this tradition of giving this wonderfully recommended essay to some of the students in your laboratory but are there other traditions or memories or just fun or funny experiences that you've shared with some of these people you've worked with that really highlight this human side of science funny enough what i'm going to share with you on the list was to meet embarassing had to be but some people do find some humor and essentially it wasn't my time and trip at where we am from working on an animal disease control and one of the tasks that i had as a particular case was to attend a farming community and work with a farmer to explore what is considered a sub-clinical you know truck infection in cows it means that they're not necessarily displaying clinical signs what you see some evidence for example we will see some some some trading the year-end frequent year-end nations for example and the idea is to help us with the diagnosing we need a urine sample especially a mid-stream urine sample which means that the animal has to be urinating and during the course of the stream of the urination you collect the sample now when i went at the time the farmer had the cold fruging so i could not collect the sample at the time so i gave the farmer the urine collection cup and i indicated the farmer that please when you get a chance i will pass that refrigerated with you to collect the sample of course so sure but please collect a mid-stream sample of urine for me and that we are going to determine what are some of the debris or the findings the determine if it's in the urine collection so that same day maybe the afternoon period you were two three hours after i returned to the farmer and the farmer was unable to collect the urine sample for me oh no so on a career i asked the farmer why and farmer responded to me that he did not have time to take the cold the river oh my goodness a mid-stream sample i actually felt there's two bit of your energy because here i was with an assumption at the farmer but honestly it was my fault because there was a gap in communication i should have effectively articulated the request to the farmer and i failed to do so that experience was actually a significant lesson for me and i've never forgotten it's a significant memory when i share to people it's funny for them and me it's a constant humbling experience as it allows me to remind myself that my communication must be very effective and no matter in what situation or who am i speaking with if my information is not trans but effectively well then that was not effective communication at all so the idea is for me personally to keep it in myself off that to hopefully not repeat that mistake again well i love this story satay i must say that something where i think scientists are always trying to be mindful of using jargon and when they're communicating with the public and it's something that some of these things that you just take for granted that you don't even think about as being jargon but you have to constantly be mindful and watchful of that yes exactly well were you able to eventually get the sample i must ask well this farm was able to talk me after i corrected my errors so the story has a happy ending too which is even better well satay wonderful story to share with our listeners and we've talked about some of the different challenges and some of the things that you've faced in terms of getting the research done in the field that you're in and i think for every scientist there's always something standing in the way between them and being able to address that dream question or to get the project done whether that's funding or staff or technology or feasibility or even time so is there a particular question satay so that you've been just dying to answer but haven't been able to tackle yet i'm reminded my own mortality for my own cancer experiences and i continue to look at people who are fighting for surviving cancer and that does occupy a lot of my community service look it does occupy a lot of my interest on my desire to keep looking at this in every god and i believe the question that always means my mind is is there a particular marker is there a particular type of biochemical derivative that we could identify that is consistent with cancers and allow that to inform the technology and the treatment which we can use a trigger of a poppuses or program cell dead among these new plastic or cancers and very passionate about that and i know there's a lot of research going on in that regard and we are looking at ways to diagnose cancer earlier we are looking at ways in which we can affect the staging of cancer treatments we are looking at different strategies towards therapeutic management and treatment as well and that continues ongoing but i share those questions my particular question is can we identify a commonality that exists among these changing cells and target that commonality using a strategy i mean we talk about programs cell dead and chemotherapy radiation therapy all of these what they do essentially is target rapidly green cells and if there's a way in which we can find a solution for that i will particularly be very happy about that and i know that cancer is already the number one cause for many countries and eventually for the world it will be the number one cause of death and morbidity and it's not necessarily the individual effect with the text families the text communities the text countries as well so i believe that the question that will help individuals families communities and populations at large is is there a strategy effectively killer cancer without even compromising the health of the patient as well because sometimes we bring patients closer to death in order to kill the cancer right i think sometimes the side effects of the treatments are so severe that patients sometimes decide not to undergo the treatment at all which is devastating exactly so i am really interested in finding a strategy to target specifically those cells and leave the health itself alone and just focus on that program that excel there for those changing can cells itself i have a personal interest in that question well satish this is a big question i'm sure it's on a lot of people's minds these days because you brought up a good point that as time goes on as our life expectancy continues to increase cancer is becoming a bigger and bigger problem that a lot of people are facing in their own lives so finding this silver bullet solution i think would be just phenomenal so great question for me and our listeners to ponder today and you've shared so much in terms of some of your insights your stories and your advice i'd love for you to give our listeners one last piece of advice perhaps the best piece that you've ever received in your own life the best piece of advice that i've received might would like this probably from my own interpretation of how i incorporated aviation into my philosophy and i share my students all the time when you think about flying an aircraft for example if you want to increase your altitude you have to increase your power and you have to bring your nose up you have to lift the nose that is actually and you're trying if you want to descend you reduce your power and you drop your nose and you will descend so somehow your nose position in an aircraft determines your altitude determines whether you are maintaining level flight if you are climbing or if you are essentially losing altitude no the orientation of the nose for aviation is called attitude the aircraft's attitude where there's a nose of altitude or a nose don't attitude and what that principle of flight what it suggests to me is depending on your nose position or your attitude it determines your altitude okay and many times when we think about our destination life or the altitude or the heights we reach in life and personally or in science or otherwise many people think it's all based on your knowledge it's all based on your attitude it's all based on your competencies etc and that's important yes but fundamentally for me it's also your attitude so if i want to extrapolate from my aviation interest and experience and apply that to inspiration for your listeners i would suggest that it is your attitude and not just your attitude which determines your altitude i love it so it's a wonderful message to give our listeners and i learned something new today i didn't realize that the attitude was the term for that so very cool yeah that's awesome so is there any other last message you want to leave our listeners with today i just really some science sciences not just a career it's not just a discipline sciences a human endeavor it's part of our innate interest you know over time with history we have looked at the sun the moon and the stars they explain realities for all i use for what the least understanding from my reference point is astrology we try to explain to know but only those by looking at the influence of the planets for example people still read their horoscopes today as a result of that and then over time as we learn more hypocrite for example brought the constant health and disease down to it he said your health is based on the airs the waters and the clear seers then over time as you are we learn about malaria malairia means bad air because we thought that disease allows you to solve a bad air bad smells and then we develop technology like microscope for example to look at microorganisms and over time we have been able as part of human development as part of social evolution that has informed our knowledge our understanding i consider that to be science so my last note is that we are in a constant quest for knowledge for understanding for development and it's science that will enable us to do that whether it's laboratory science bend science whether it's medical sciences whether it's social sciences they all clear rule so i believe that each and every one of us have a part of play because we collectively will determine the future because our reality will eventually be expressed physically as well Hollywood is great at predicting the future right may times you see these movies and these books that you stay with all of that to be future for us and the future is in our minds what we perceive that to be our reality and science that will support this human endeavor going forward whether it's curing diseases whether it's taking flight beyond the planet for example it's all science of help us so i would encourage people to embrace it to participate in it because invariably from my perspective science is quintessentially human well so tesh wonderful note to end on i love that you highlighted this human side of science because that's something that we strive to show on our program and i couldn't agree with you more here so great message for our listeners and if our listeners want to learn more about you and all the wonderful work you're doing where should they go or how should they get in touch well feel free to go onto my university's website singlite.org.invac.edu and there you can find me sateesh with dse it's on our resource profile for example and you'll find my background you'll find some of the projects i'm involved in as well as ways in which you can contact me to email to telephone for example as well but if i may just say my email address contact as well my skype contact is sateesh.bdc which is my name with a dot in between the full sentence name sateesh.bdc and also if you want to email me you can email me sbdc sbid.seg.edu and i'll be happy to engage and interact with your listeners i am where i am today because i have been fortunate the benefit from mentors in my life i've been able to stand on the shoulders of many giants and i believe in a cycle of life that i also need to do the same for other people as well so i am willing and i'm happy in any way that i can serve to inspire the mentor and the partner people in any way in which they feel that i can contribute to as well wonderful well sateesh thank you so much for talking to all of us here today and for sharing some of your stories and listeners definitely get in touch if you have any questions it's been such a pleasure to speak with you thank you as well and i look forward to the opportunity for your series to continue to inspire persons and also to reinvigorate persons already in science well i sincerely appreciate that and listeners it's been great to have you with us here today we hope that you're leaving this interview inspired as well and we'll see you next time on another episode of people behind the scienceit’s your stepsister’s weird friend who comes over and eats all your good cereal, AlieWard, back with another episode of Ologies. Also a mini episode went up today about some NewYear’s changes and they’re very exciting, and they’re very near and dear to my heart, so please takea few minutes to catch up on that news should you desire. It’s a lot of really good stuff, and I’mexcited.So I have been waiting to cover this particular ology for months and hot damn, whether you arecurrently smothered in alive cats or are adamantly a dog or a turtle person, this episode is gonnainform you and endear you to our be-whiskered companions so hardcore. Because cats, you guys,they’re not all dicks, we get into it.Okay but first let’s just wild out with a little business in which I thank the Patrons atPatreon.com/Ologies. You guys make this show possible. You’re such good friends to this show!Thank you, also, to everyone wearing Ologies shirts and such from OlogiesMerch.com (PS: we nowhave black shirts available, science goths). And, thank you to everyone who subscribes, rates andleaves a review, which you know I read. Yeah, I read ‘em! Yeah, I’m a creep! And this week’s freshreview is from #1 Cthulu Stan, who says:This is the science podcast my soul has craved since birth. It’s an intoxicating blend of funny andmind-bendingly strange, 10/10 would recommend to any person, eldritch being, mythologicalcreature, gaping void of existential horror.All of the above, right here.Okay, felinology. It comes from the Latin for cat, ‘feles’ and I started to go down this whoooolerabbit hole... this whole cat-acomb (I’m sorry) whether or not felicity, like ‘feliz,’ and happiness, andfeline shared an etymology and from what I found they don’t, at all, but I did have a galaxy brainmoment realizing that Felix the Cat is because of feline. Duh. Like, I never got that. Also pocketknowledge for your next bar trivia slaughter: A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder orbetter yet, a glaring. So, I hope that helps you somewhere in your life.But it’s taken me 70 episodes to cover Felinology because I just wanted to get the best person forthe job. Boy howdy, did I. She is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Animal Behavior in the School ofVeterinary Medicine at the University of California at Davis studying… kittens! Neonatal tinykittens! And she got her bachelor’s in Psychology, and then she got a PhD at Cal Berkeley in animalcognition, and she’s co-authored various papers, for example — Cat play: A review of itsdevelopment, functions, and future research considerations and Beyond bossy: Feline statusaggression.She also is the co-author, alongside Animal Planet’s My Cat from Hell host, Jackson Galaxy, of thebook, Total Cat Mojo: The Ultimate Guide to Life with Your Cat. Woman wrote the book on cats! And 2if you deconstruct her last name, phonetically, it sounds like OF THE CAT in Spanish. I mean, comeon!So, I went to her home outside of Davis, California over the holidays. I petted her cat, first off, andthen we chatted about cattitudes, litter boxes, how to keep your BFF from sitting on your face at 3in the morning, cats on toilets, LOL videos, cat training, feral friends, optimal cat habitats, who willeat your CORPSE if you die alone, kitties and their domestication history, and cats: are they dicks orwhat? Stretch out on a patch of sun and learn what’s happening in their minds with author, scholar,and felinologist, Dr. Mikel Delgado.[Intro Music]----------Mikel: It's very common. People think it's Mee-kehl, so yeah…Alie: Yeah, I wasn’t sure. And doctor, of course. And so how long have you been studying cats?Mikel: So, coming up on 20 years. I got my start at an animal shelter in the behavior programthere and got a PhD in animal behavior at UC Berkeley where I primarily studiedsquirrels, but I also looked at the cat-human relationship while I was at Berkeley and Iknew when I finished my PhD that I wanted to finally have the opportunity to doresearch with cats. That's one of the reasons that I was really excited to do my postdocat UC Davis where there's a veterinary school and there's also an animal behaviorprograms, so it's kind of the perfect place to be studying animal behavior, and theperfect place to study cats.Alie: Are cats and squirrels alike in terms of behavior at all?Mikel: I mean, I guess if you think of them as naughty. [laughs] I think they both evoke strongemotions in people, like people either really love them or really hate them, but they arekind of territorial. Their social lives are different, but neither of them lives in a pack.They're not animals that, kind of, naturally have really strong relationships that makesense to us, because we're very used to a group kind of structure where there's a clearhierarchy, and I would say neither cats nor squirrels have that kind of relationship.Alie: So are cats more of a lone wolf than wolves?Mikel: I think cats have this reputation for being solitary, and what they are is they're solitaryhunters, so they don't need other animals to survive, right? They hunt very small preythat they can catch on their own and they don't share it. Which is different from largeranimals that hunt and capture large animals. I think because of that cats got thisreputation for being asocial where they don't need anybody, and we know that theirsocial lives are definitely more complicated than that.Aside: So it’s like when you go out to a nice Chinese restaurant and you say,“should we all get a bunch of dishes, do family style?” and cats are the friends who arelike, “Nah, I’m just gonna get my own noodles… Not into it.” Solitary hunters, got it. I canrespect that. Now this next tidbit: it’s amazing, relatable, and dare I say, it’s a little catty. 3Mikel: Cats will form what call preferred associates where they have certain cats that they liketo hang out with. Some signs of them being friends would be, they groom each other,they sleep together, touching, or what we call pillowing, where they're actually usinganother cat as a pillow. You might see playful behavior, and in general you don't see alot of signs of antagonism, although I'd say just, you know, we don't get along with oursiblings 100% of the time; you might see the occasional tiff.Alie: So they have cliques!Mikel: They do; and you'll see if you have a group of cats that, say, if you live with five cats, youmight have two cats that get along with each other and not with anyone else. And theother three cats could be composed of: one cat who doesn't get along with anybody andanother pair who get along, or maybe there's one cat who gets along with everybody,but the rest of the cats don't really like each other. So it can be very complicated. [clipfrom Mean Girls, “That's against the rules and you can’t sit with us.”]Aside: Okay here it is, this is the secret: what makes a cat an asshole or not.Mikel: What we do see is that cat groups are most successful when they have enoughresources. So, you'll see feral colonies that exist because there's either plenty of preyaround or there is human-supplied food. There has to be enough to go around, basically,for them to tolerate each other and then have the opportunity to become friends! If youdon't have enough resources, either in your home or outside, or there's too muchcompetition, they have to do too much sharing of those resources, then they tend toeither have antagonistic interactions or they'll just avoid each other.Alie: So they get bitchy when there's scarcity.Mikel: Exactly. Like all of us. Right? If there's not enough cookies to go around, there's going tobe…Alie: I’ll cut someone.Mikel: Yeah, exactly. You don't have to be that person that leaves the last cookie, you know,everyone's kind of staring at the last one, like, who's going to eat it? No, you can justgrab it.Alie: I'll throw hands for it. So, getting back to your history, you have been involved with catsfor 20 years now. Can you take me back to when you first, kind of, realized that youwere maybe more of a cat person, or when you really started connecting with them?Mikel: Yeah, I mean I've always been obsessed with cats since I was a little kid. I think my momprobably got sick of me begging for a cat. And finally when I was a teenager sherelented, even though she was allergic. I don't know, I've always just thought cats wereamazing. I loved all animals, but I definitely feel awkward with dogs, which is funnybecause a lot of people say they find cats hard to read, but I actually find the opposite istrue. I can't understand dogs. Like, they don't purr, I don't know, I feel awkward. I feelthey're awkward. Whereas with cats I just have always felt in tune with them andthey're kind of easy to read for me. 4But, you know, I definitely was not that kid who was like, “oh, I'm going to be a scientistwhen I grow up.” I really didn't have a plan or a clue. I dropped out of college when Iwas 21 because I really didn't know what I wanted to do. Well, what I wanted to do wasmove to California and be in a rock band, which is exactly what I did. I grew up in Maineand I basically was like, “I'm moving to California!” And so I moved to San Francisco anddid not have any kind of plan that I was going to work with cats even though I lovedcats. I worked at a health food cooperative, played in bands, I volunteered at a punk rockrecord store. So, my life was very much a revolving around kind of this punk scene andcollective work environments. And it wasn't until that cat that I had begged my mom toget me when I was a teenager… he died in 2000.Aside: Oh nooooo. [super sad, low-pitched, and drawn out]Mikel: And I decided to start volunteering at the local animal shelter, which was the SanFrancisco SPCA, just because I wanted more cat time. I had another cat at home but Iknew that I just wanted to… I mean maybe I was on the market for a new cat? You know,which is… if you work in a shelter you see them all, you get first dibs. But you know, itwas also just kind of missing that connection I had. It was actually a friend of mine,Casey, who was like, “Oh, you should come volunteer at the SPCA,” because he wasvolunteering there, and basically that just changed everything for me. And I realized thatfirst of all, “oh, you can do this for a job? Like, you can work with animals? Cool!” [DJairhorn!] And at the time the SPCA had a pretty involved behavior program. They had awhole program for cats that was, first of all, rehabilitating and working with cats in theshelter that were having difficulties coping.Aside: So Mikel worked at the SPCA helping these seemingly impuurrfect kittieswho were having a hard time getting accepted into loving homes. But speaking of that:let’s take a quick detour down an old cobblestone alley, into the past. So when did catsgo from African wildcats and European forest animals to the little buddies who watch uspee sometimes and who we love more than our blood relatives? Let’s discussdomesticity.Mikel: Okay. So the domestication story for cats is a little bit complicated, and depending onwhich person you talk to you, the question is, are they truly, fully domesticated?Because they don't really meet some of the criteria for domestication, and their path todomestication was not a traditional one where we didn't take them and modify them forhuman use. It was instead what they call commensalism where the cats benefited fromhuman settlements, so that is really when cats started becoming domesticated whenhumans became, you know, Agrarians and started settling, and had large stores ofgrains which attracted rodents.So, I think a lot of people think, ‘oh, the cats are doing humans a favor by catchingrodents’ but it turns out that humans actually had other animals that did that just fine,like terriers and some of the weasel-type animals that are good ratters, so we didn'tnecessarily need cats to do that for us. Cats actually benefited more from therelationship than humans did. What we believe is that cats that were taking advantageof this human resource, which was basically, indirectly leading to lots of mice and rats 5gathering around humans. Cats who could take advantage of that, and were friendlier,were more likely to be maybe tossed a scrap meat from a human or given shelter byhumans. So probably over time we helped cats become more tolerant of people and ofeach other.And so, the question of whether or not cats are truly domestic… There's lots of reasonsto think that they're not as domesticated and one is that they can survive pretty wellwithout human support. The last estimate I read was that 97% of cats choose their ownmates. Domestication is usually under much more controlled breeding. So in thatrespect it's more like they've become more tolerant of people and other cats over timeand we've become more interested in them over time. It's only in the last, say, 50 yearsthat we've, kind of, imposed this new lifestyle on them where we're keeping themindoors exclusively.It's a pretty rapid change given that they're domestication is estimated over the past…like 8,000 or 10,000 years is, kind of, the range where you start seeing evidence of thembeing kept as pets and you see fossils where they were buried with people in the MiddleEast. But really only last 50 years that we've, kind of, asked them to stay inside all thetime.Alie: Oh. Because they were really more like barn cats and outdoor cats before that? The last50 years, that's nothing!Mikel: And that was really sped up by the invention of kitty litter. [clip of TV commercial, “I’mEd Lowe… Since I invented cat box filler in 1947, I’ve been improving it ever since. Youmight wonder what motivates a man like me. Simple! I love cats.”]Then, recommendations by various veterinary and humanitarian groups that catsshould be kept exclusively indoors to prevent injury, prevent predation of otheranimals. I think part of why we see that struggle a lot of the times is that we've askedthem to change their lifestyle very rapidly and yet the person doesn't want to give thema litter box or cat tree.Alie: So you have to meet cats halfway more than you would a dog.Mikel: Yeah. You know, I think there's been a lot more selection with dogs for things eventhough it might seem really minute, but like, facial expressions. Right? So dogs have a lotmore facial muscles and we probably selected them for that because we like thereflection back of human expressions, like smiling.Alie: And their eyes having white so that we can see where they're looking. That’s so crazy!Aside: So what’s more important to cats? Their owner or their living space? If a cathad to get a full belly tattoo of one of those things, surely it would be a portrait of theirowner with the inked inscription, ‘Snug Life.’ Not a tattoo of the couch, right?Mikel: So we know that cats are really territorial, and so what's more important to them thananything is the familiarity of where they live. Even before they'll form attachments withpeople they need to feel comfortable in their space. It's almost like we're part of theterritory, especially because most cats live inside. This is where they live, right? And so 6we're just part of their space. It's not like we're separate from it, we're a part of it. Andthat's what their primary attachment is, to their territory. [clip from the Step Brothersmovie, “this is MY house now”] So if you rip a cat out of their home and away from theirpeople into a strange environment with a bunch of other animals that are freaking out,they're going to be really stressed.Some cats just had a lot of difficulty coping with that change. So they'd be very fearful,they'd be hiding, some of them would maybe be biting and scratching if you tried to petthem, which is not great for getting adopted, right? People who come into a shelter, theywant to be hands on and they want the cat that’s going to come right up to them and,you know, interact and purr, be friendly…Alie: Not draw blood.Mikel: Drawing blood is bad for getting adopted. Although those cats eventually will getadopted, but usually just because they start adapting to the environment. So, part of ourgoal was to just help them adjust.Aside: Mikel really had a passion to make sure all these kitties found homes, and shefound that a clutch part of the strategy was just educating the public to be fluent in kitty.She loved it.Mikel: So we had classes for the public on cat behavior and how to keep your cat happy. Thenwe also had a behavior hotline where people who were having problems with their catscould call. We would get over 100 calls a month. I mean, there's a lot of people out therewith cat questions and cat problems, or they just don't understand their cat's naturalbehavior and why their cats doing some of the things they would do. But one of thethings I learned during that experience was I really wanted to see the homeenvironment, like what's going on in the home, or be able to talk to everyone in thehousehold at the same time.And so in 2008, one of my coworkers and I left the shelter and started our businessFeline Minds. And so we offered consultations, typically in home, although we do a lot ofSkype and phone consultations nowadays as well; where we go to people's houses, youknow, check out the scene, meet their cat if the cat's open to it, and then give them amodification plan to help them solve a behavior problem.Alie: Oh, so you realized from being at the shelter that you could make a job out of this.Mikel: It’s a semi-living? Yeah. I mean, I remember the day I came home from the shelter andsaid to my boyfriend, like, I want to be a cat behaviorist. And he was like, “cool, let'smake it happen.” So, yeah, I really just sunk myself into the field of behavior, and it wasaround the same time that I started the business that I realized that I wanted to go backto school. I dropped out of college when I was 21, and here I was realizing that eventhough I learned a lot about cats and behavior, working at the shelter, that there wasalso this other world of formal behavior theory. And perhaps to do some of the things Iwanted that I needed that college degree that I'd blown off when I was 21 to go playrock music. 7And so now I was like, “okay, if I'm going to really be serious about being an adult andhaving a real job, maybe I should go back to school.” And so I just went to finish mybachelor's degree in psychology with an emphasis on animal behavior. And then I waslike, “wow, being in school is awesome. I want to do this forever.” And so I decided Iwanted to get a PHD, which takes forever, so I was able to stay in school forever. Andthroughout grad school I did the consulting business, which is still going, so, you know,still helping people with their myriad behavior problems with their cats.Alie: And now doing postdoc, you mentioned that you work with neonatal kittens. So...[high-pitched squeaky modulator] tiny widdle kittens!Mikel: Yeah, it's gotten even cuter. When I was doing my PhD working with squirrels, I didn'tknow if it could get cuter, but I'm now doing a postdoc with kittens. It did get cuter.Alie: And so what does your job typically involve?Mikel: It really varies. In the summer when we were collecting data with the neonatal kittens, Imight literally get a call from a rescue group that was like, “We just got some orphanedkittens in. We need a foster home now,” so then it's coordinating with one of the otherrescue groups to find a foster parent for these kittens, and coordinating a lot of things.We were taking blood samples on these kittens because one of the things we'reinterested in is whether or not being separated from their mom at an early age has anypossible effects on their health.We're looking at a biological marker called telomeres, which are caps at the end of yourDNA, and these have a protective effect when your cells replicate. They, kind of, preventthe important stuff from getting cut off because, basically, some stuff gets truncatedwhen your cells replicate. What you want to get truncated is, kind of, the extra garbageat the end but not the important stuff. So the telomeres are, kind of, the extra stuff at theend.Short telomeres are associated with, basically, a shorter lifespan. We see shortertelomeres in multiple species, including humans that have chronic disease, that liveunder chronic stress, have been subjected to adverse early childhood experiences. Andso we're really looking at early maternal separation as a possible adverse experience forthese kittens. We don't know… we were collecting blood from these kittens in their firstweek of life when they're very, very tiny, like 100 grams. And then right before theywere getting spayed and neutered at, like, 8 to 10 weeks of age.Aside: So for us metrically-challenged Americans, 100 grams is about the weight ofhalf a medium-sized apple, or 1 stick of butter, or 50,000 termites. Mikel’s lab workinvolves comparing the blood and telomeres of baby kittehs separated from their momswith a control group of baby cats. Her daily work life involves coordinating fostervolunteers who collect info about what goes into the kitties, and what comes out of thekitties, incubation efforts -- keeping the neonatal wee ones in special contraptions thatare 90 degrees and 60% humidity. She notes: it’s very similar to a bread machine. Andsometimes she’s running all over the place, driving vital supplies around town. And I 8asked Mikel what felinological charity she’d like a portion of this episode’s ad revenue togo to and she said KittenCentralofPlacerCounty.org, which I will link in the show notes.They’re helping over a 1000 displaced cats from the Camp Fire and their mission is to“Reduce euthanasia rates for medically dependent neonatal kittens through action andeducation.” So that is, kittencentralofplacercounty.org. Okay, back to Mikel and herresearch. Some of it is… I’m not gonna lie, a little shocking. Little bit of an ohhhhnooooooo.Mikel: Other days I'm literally just sitting in front of a computer typing in data into Excel, orreading research papers that are relevant to what I'm doing, or watching videos.One thing that came out of this research that we started doing this past summer wasthat a lot of orphaned kittens… [high-pitched squeaky modulator layered over Mikel’snormal voice] suck on each other's genitals. So, I've been watching a lot ofsemi-pornographic videos of kittens… um… goin’ to town on their litter mates’ crotches.The sad thing is that they will do it to the extent that they damage and injure their littermates that they're sucking on. So some of these kittens have to have their penisesremoved. It's not a good scene.Alie: No, that's bad on bad on bad.Mikel: It's really bad. The videos are very risqué. Like, I don't know if I could show them in amixed audience with children or whatever.Alie: When you said you watch a lot of cat videos, that is not what I was thinking. Mostpeople’s cat videos are like, “Tsk, he knocked somethin’ off the shelf again!” Not a, “heate his brother’s penis.” Ooof! So they are just looking for anything that’s like a nipple.Mikel: Yeah. What it really just tells us is that the nursing instinct is very strong for obviousreasons. You need to nurse to survive, but it's obviously not just satisfied by food andthere's probably a lot of other reasons that animals do it. We know that there's a lot ofnon-nutritive nursing that goes on. Who knows what the actual experience of sucking isdoing for their little brains as far as releasing endorphins?Alie: Oxytocin maybe?Mikel: I mean, we don't know. Some kittens are victims and suckers, so you'll have like a littledaisy chain of kittens.Alie: [sad and horrified] It’s like Human Centipede! [Transcriber Note: if you’ve gotten this farand don’t know what this is: for the love of all that is kittens, don’t look it up.]Mikel: Because we became aware of this problem and there's very little information about it,no one's researched it, and no one's really come up with effective solutions for it. That'sbecome one of the focuses of my research. Hopefully next year we'll be looking at somepossible prevention strategies, including a surrogate mother-type situation. And thenyou have other people that do things like put clothing on the kittens, which, you know,ethically is a little questionable. May not be comfortable. Of course it's better than thekittens, like, yeah, basically destroying their litter mate’s junk.9Alie: But I'd rather wear pants than have someone eat my dick off my body.Mikel: We're trying to come up with some strategies to fix that problem and also try tounderstand what it is about these particular kittens that makes them more prone to thisbehavior.Aside: Even though research like this can be a little heartbreaking, and honestlypretty gut-wrenching, Mikel says that after working with lab animals, like pigeons, inundergrad, she’s a lot happier now doing research with wild or domesticated crittersbecause she just loves animals -- especially cats -- and she wants her research to begood or at the very least neutral for the individual animals involved.So let’s look at the bright side: the kittens in her study end up adopted! So that’s a happyending. Oh and I asked what the outcome of the telomere length was and she saysthey’re working with a genetics lab and should have the results in the next few months.So if you are around kittens all day, what happens in your off hours?Alie: When you need to decompress after a particularly long day or project, do you watch catvideos like the rest of us do?Mikel: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean that's what Facebook’s for.Alie: Why do you think cat videos do so well? And do you have a favorite? I'm just going toask you stupid questions, I’m sorry.Mikel: Okay. So I have mixed feelings about cat videos because I think I'm more sensitive totheir body language than people are, people that don't know cats as well. I sometimessee videos where the cats are actually showing signs of stress and people think it'sfunny. I also don't like cats dressed up in clothing, so… That's just philosophical. I don'tlike it when the cats are being physically manipulated. I like the, you know, catsshredding rolls of toilet paper. That never gets old to me.Alie: How can you tell in a cat video if the cat is stressed?Mikel: Well, I'm always looking at: is the cat showing signs of relaxation or showing signs oftension? What's their body doing? Does it look like they're being either threatened orcoerced into something, cornered? If it's a cat who's showing signs of aggression, then Ifeel like that is not a good situation, cats being exploited. And like I said, people don'trecognize that aggression, growling, hissing, all of those behaviors stem from fear. [clipfrom the Wizard of Oz: Dorothy to the Lion, “Why, you’re nothin’ but a great big coward!”Lion, “I even scare myself.”] Even a cat who is actively attacking someone, the root of thataggression is always some type of anxiety or fear, and that means the animal isexperiencing some level of distress.Aside: Just like humans! Every time some jerkoff yells at you in traffic it’s justbecause they’re afraid of merging too fast and getting in an accident! Or they might bescared of being late somewhere and getting yelled at. And if you’re the one screaming atpeople in traffic, here’s some news, my fragile human: You’re just afraid of things.Maybe take a minute, look inward, find some coping strategies; you can listen to mytwo-part Fearology episode with Mary Poffenroth, just sayin’. Calm it down. 10Okay back to cats being scared for internet likes!Mikel: So to me it's just not funny. If it's a cat who's trying to make a jump from the kitchentable to the couch and they don't quite make it, you know, as long as they're not injured.Physical gags. I like old style comedy. [laughs]Alie: [laughs] And I do have a question about how they are able to land so well. Did you everhave to study their landing capabilities?Mikel: No, but you know, they do have an amazingly flexible body. They have no collar bone, sothat allows them to… If their head can get through, if their face is through, like under adoor, they can just squeeze right through, which is why you shouldn't leave yourwindow open just an inch thinking your cat won't get out. [Ron from Parks & Recreation,“I’m out.”]They have this amazing sense of balance. I mean, they have to catch trees. They have tobe able to calculate distance when they hunt and be able to pounce right where theythink they are. They have that amazing tail that helps them right themselves. A tail is agood way to orient your body. It's kind of a control to allow you to right yourself. What'sinteresting is that there's something called High Rise Syndrome where cats who fallfrom a higher distance often experience fewer injuries than cats that fall from a shorterdistance.Alie: So they have time in the air to go [comically] woaa-aaahhh!Mikel: [laughs] “Okay, this is what's happening.” Probably not a lot of time but enough.Alie: Now, you have a cat. Let's say someone has a cat. How do they know if their cat ishappy? Is sad? Is bummed out? Needs something? What body language markers are soimportant to know if you have a cat?Mikel: First of all, is your cat doing the basics? Are they eating, using the litter box, and are theyusing their space? A cat who's spending all their time under your bed, probably nothappy. A cat who is freely walking through the space, probably more relaxed. Specificbody language we're interested in… for cats, when they're feeling friendly, they'll dowhat we call the ‘tail up gesture.’ This is a friendly greeting, and the tail is completely up,maybe in this, like, question mark, but that is something you'll see when they approacheither a friendly human or friendly other cat, they will be exhibiting that body language.You can also see when they're laying down, they should be either on their sidesometimes or paws tucked, which tells you they're not kind of gearing to run away. [oldcartoon ‘running away’ sound] A cat who is feeling defensive or unsure is going to be,kind of, crouched in a tense position where they could easily just, pshoo! take off if theyneeded to, as opposed to, “I'm laying down and just kinda melting in the sun over here.Therefore I'm not feeling any threat.”Then there are more subtle things like, are the pupils relaxed and somewhat dilated? Imean, of course according to the lighting in the room. Are the ears up? Ears up is morerelaxed, can be alert as well but certainly flattened ears are a sign of a cat who's makingthemselves smaller. You’ll see things that cats do when they're fearful, aside from 11hiding, like tucking their tail, putting their ears back, hunching. So they're trying to,again, make themselves seem smaller.A cat who is on the offensive might be trying to make themselves look bigger. So that'skind of the classic Halloween pose where they’re, kind of, puffed up. And you'll see thatmore reserved for fighting with other animals where they're trying to bluff, like, “I'm bigand scary. You shouldn't fight with me because [deep, low-pitched voice modulator] I'mbig and scary.” For cats in a home, it's really more about using the space, doing theirnormal kitty things. Purring is great, eye blinking is a sign of relaxation and a sign oftrust. We know that staring is threatening to most animals, so you shouldn't stare atyour cat.Alie: Oh really? So, don’t make loving eye contact with your cat for too long.Mikel: Eye contact’s fine, but make it soft and blink your eyes a lot, as opposed to hard stare. AHard stare is what is threatening for them. And you'll see cats that don't get along, willavoid direct eye contact, or the one cat will be staring you down, or a staring the othercat down, like, “I've got my eyes on you.” Eye contact is very important. Cats may befearful of particular people in the house. Toddlers can be difficult for cats to cope with,but it really depends on the context and the cat’s ability to escape and deal with thestressor in their environment.Aside: To deal with it, some cats get high as fuuuuh. Like literally, elevated. Top ofthe fridge, et cetera.Mikel: A cat who has a cat tree or shelving and can get up high away from a dog or a toddler isgoing to be able to cope with that situation much better than a cat who doesn't havethose escape routes.Alie: What do you do when you walk into someone's house who has a cat? How can you makethe cat dig you? Is it better you get low, not look at it? What should you do?Mikel: You should ghost them.Alie: Really?! You should just ignore them a little bit?Mikel: Ignore them a little bit.Alie: So the opposite of a dog, because the dog would be crushed if you walked in and you'relike, “What dog? I don't see a dog.”Mikel: I’m a dog ghoster for sure.Aside: Okay, so, what we’ve learned: Just because they’re not dogs, doesn’t meanthat cats are assholes. They could be scared, or just territorial. But, why do cats like youto be an asshole to them? Why do we have to play hard to get like it’s 2007 and thatdating book The Rules just came out, and we’re not supposed to accept a Saturday nightdate with a cat if they ask after Wednesday. WHY MUST WE FEIGN ALOOFNESS WHENWE WANT LOVE? 12Mikel: For cats, yeah. Research has shown that they prefer interactions with humans wherethey control the interaction, when they initiate and not the human. If a personapproaches a cat and pets them versus sitting back and letting the cat come to you, thecats who come to you, you're going to have a longer interaction. It's going to be morepositive, which is pretty funny. What I would recommend if you do want to greet a cat isget down on their level, offer a finger or your hand to them, let them sniff it, and then letthem decide if they want to rub against your hand, or come closer, or if they're gonnajust, you know, “Okay. Keep your distance.”Aside: Let’s say you adopt an elegant, furry enigma and it’s so sweet to you but ithates your brother. Or your child. Or why does one cat file a lawsuit against you whenyou turn on the vacuum but the other is chill as hell about it?Mikel: As far as your question, do cats prefer certain types of people over the others? Youknow, some of it is probably due to socialization. Cats have a socialization window that'sreally short and early, so between two and seven weeks is the ideal time for them to beexposed to different types of people, different animals and different experiences, likesounds in your house, like your coffee grinder or a blender. Unfortunately, most catsdon't get adopted between two and seven weeks of age because they really need to bewith mom still, or they're still on foster. Or they're not even in the rescue group yet,they're still out in the cabbage patch being wild.Unfortunately, a lot of cats are what we would consider slightly under socialized. Theydidn't get a lot of exposure to lots of different things when they were young. For dogs,their socialization period is later and longer. So it means that they're more flexible andadaptable because they have this… You can take a slightly more laid-back pace withsocializing them. They just have more opportunity to get exposed to different people,different things. A lot of cats probably grow up in a very quiet environment, maybethey're exposed to one person who's bottle feeding them at first and then taking care ofthem. When they get into a home it's like, “holy shit, what are you?”So yeah, I think some cats prefer women because women have higher voices, we’requieter, our footfall is softer. We're not as threatening. And I think what's also importantto consider about cats is that we think of them as predators, right? That's very much ourfocus on, you know, ‘keep a cats indoors, they’re killing birds” and they're hunters, andthat's natural for them. But they're also prey animals, so they're not an apex predator.They're vulnerable to larger animals, including humans, also dogs. More outsideenvironments; wolves, possibly even hawks.So, they're always on guard. They're not going to be that relaxed, like, sleepy lion thatwe often think of them as because they never know when someone's going to come andeat them. That is why I think the kind of ‘scaredy cat’ stereotype prevails, [Cowardly Lionsobbing] is that they have to be cautious.Alie: They’re just watching their back. So you have this really, kind of, delicate balance ofhunter and hunted in them. They're complex, psychologically. 13Mikel: Yes they are. People really… because they don't understand cats, they like to projectthoughts onto them. It's like they're, “I don't understand you. So I'm just going to makeup stuff and hope that it is right. So I'm going to think you want to kill me.” You know, orthink that you’re lazy, or you think people are stupid. I think a lot of the internet jokesabout cats are that they're assholes and they want to kill us, they hate us, they knowwe're calling them but they just ignore us because they're assholes.Alie: Right. “They're judging us all the time.”Mikel: Judging. Exactly. I mean, they probably are judging us all the time.Alie: As we were talking about this, your cat has now hopped on the table.Mikel: She is going to, perhaps, make an appearance.Aside: Okay, so at this moment a wispy, white and gray li’l animal princess namedClarabelle suddenly appeared on the table. Just materialized. She’s tiny, and beautifulwith big green eyes, and I wanted to [silly auntie voice] scoop her up and stuff her in mysweatshirt and demand that she love me back. But, as I’ve recently learned, cats are notdown with that vibe.Alie: Helloooo! She's so pretty.Mikel: She's very sweet.Alie: And she's 15?! Okay, [quietly] I'm going to put my finger out. She can smell my finger.She's smelling the mic. [gentle sniffing sounds] Hello! Now… should I not pet her?Mikel: I think the other thing about ‘the laws of cats’ is that the best thing to do is know the catyou're dealing with. So, we know from science that cats prefer to be petted on theirhead, like their cheeks and forehead, and that everywhere else is kinda, “eh.” But somecats love belly rubs, and you know, there's only one way to find out which is: pet yourcat and see what they do. If they tell you they don't like something then don't do it again.If they seem to like it, try it again and see.Alie: So they're very individual.Mikel: They are, I mean just like we are. Thinking of them as individuals is very important tounderstanding them and their general, kind of, guidelines that apply. But that doesn'tmean that your cat is going to, of course, fit into every single one of those slots.Alie: And when you're thinking about making your environment more comfortable to them,what kind of tips do you have?Mikel: You know, the first thing is embrace that your house is going to look like you live with acat. [audience applause] You know, it really drives me crazy when people say, “I don'twant my house to look like I live with a cat.” Well, why do you have four cats, then? Like,I'm sorry, but… You need to have a litter box that's accessible and not in the garage, youknow, with some like 10-mile trail, and walking through a billion cat flaps to get to. Andyou need vertical space. You need to create spaces for your cat, and a lot of people arelike, “oh, he just sits on the couch with me.” What if he doesn't want to share the couch 14with you? He wants his own space! You're not going to sit on his cat tree, so give him acat tree.It's definitely critical for a few reasons. One is that we're increasingly living in urbanspaces that are small, and we want to have multiple cats, and we're trying to get them toshare smaller and smaller spaces. So, going vertical is a great way to add to your squarefootage as far as the cats are concerned. You can have two cats literally on top of eachother on a cat tree! They're sharing the same square footage, but they're not botheringeach other. I think, you know, making it useful as well, like don't stick the cat tree in theback corner where they can't look at anything. Put it by a window where they can watchbirds, put it in a sunny spot, make it something that's appealing to them.Aside: Quick aside, I will say that when I walked up to Mikel’s house, I noted asingle, tall carpet-ensconced cat tree right in the front window, as if it were Cat Treeseason and this was a Macy’s window display. I was like, oh, hello. Oh, and right in thesun. I wondered if cats like that? TURNS OUT: YES. Like duh, how much better is awindow seat than a middle seat? How have I never considered this before? Also, thispart about heat was new science kitty information and it forever changes the way I lookat cat behavior.Mikel: The other thing that I definitely recommend for making your cats comfortable is aheated cat bed. Cats have a thermoneutral zone that's higher than ours. A thermoneutralzone is, basically, the temperatures at which you're not working to either warm up orcool off. So, we're not sweating, we’re not shivering, we're just relaxed. And for humans,you know, because we wear clothes, our thermoneutral zone is pretty low. High 60s,low 70s is where we're comfortable. Cats, it's like starting in the mid-80s.Alie: Really?! Oh my gosh. Because, but they're nude, but they're also so fuzzy. They'reconstantly in a fur coat!Mikel: They are fuzzy. They’re definitely not… They didn't necessarily, you know, imaginethemselves living in chilly, frigid climes, except for… Certainly there's long-haired catsthat, basically, were domesticated out of certain areas of Eastern Europe where theyhave longer, fuller coats. But your average cat is going to be much happier at a warmertemperature. Now, if you get a heated bed, will your cat stop sitting on your lap asmuch? Maybe, because the bed is warmer than you are now. I do think that it reallymakes them happier. It makes them more comfortable. There's a reason that cat'scongregate around heating vents. They love to be hot.Alie: Is that why they want to come on your laptop?Mikel: Sit on a laptop, absolutely. Cable boxes, stereos, computers, laptops. If it's warm they'regoing to try to sit on it.Alie: They're not just trying to cock block your work.Mikel: Well, you know, the other thing, of course… the other motivating factor is humanattention. What are we staring at more than almost anything? Our stupid-ass computerscreens. So if they can somehow get in there like, “Hey, will you give me some 15attention?” You know, cats will get attention when they can, and so the other question Iget asked a lot is, why does my cat follow me into the bathroom and try to sit on my lapwhile I'm taking a dump? It's because it's the only time that you're not running around,texting people or… maybe you are texting people. Your attention is not divided and youcan't get up and do something else. So they're gonna grab a little love while they can.Alie: So you're held captive by the toilets. They're like, “is this a good time? Is this - you seemto be stationary. Let's talk about me.” Oh my God speaking of bathrooms, how do youcultivate the best litter box scenario and also have your house not smell like a litter box?Your house does not smell like a litter box.Mikel: I appreciate that. I clean the box daily. Just for the record, there's litter box around thecorner. I have a litter box in my living room. I practice what I preach. I have three litterboxes in my relatively small house for my one cat. So, you know, there's kind of somebasic rules for litter boxes, like have at least one box per cat.Aside: [with audience cheering, like Oprah] YOU GET A LITTERBOX! YOU GET ALITTERBOX! YOU GET A LITTERBOX!!!Mikel: More is even better. If you have two cats, three boxes would be ideal. Keep them clean.One of the reasons I don't recommend covered litter boxes is, I mean, it's up for debatewhether or not cats don't like the cover or not. I mean, the cover definitely limits theirability to move around and find a clean corner and feel comfortable. But it also meansthat the owner is not cleaning the box as often. There's actually research that showedthat cats with litter box problems with covered boxes, the owners were cleaning the boxaround every five days. [clip of Luniz’s’ song, “I got fiiiiiiiive on it”] Because, out of sightout of mind.So, I actually prefer, like, have it where you live because you will keep it clean. It shouldbe accessible to the cat. I think because we don't like to take a dump in front of otherpeople, usually, we think that the cats want a lot of privacy. And so people hide the boxin some back room next to the washing machine, or in the garage because they think thecat needs privacy. The cat does not give a care. They will take a dump right in front ofyou. It should be… obviously, if you have a home that's heavily trafficked, then youprobably wouldn't want the litter box in the middle of the most trafficked area of yourhouse. Quiet but not too far out of the way. It should be accessible and easy for them toget to.And just like we want a bathroom on every floor of our house, your cat wants to litterbox on every floor of their house. And this is especially important if you have a cat whois either elderly or a kitten because access is going to be important. As far as otheraspects of the litter box, most cats prefer unscented sandy-type litter that clumps.Really, the biggest thing is scooping it. There was a study done by Purina a few years agothat was actually pretty genius. The main question was whether or not cats were willingto share a litter box with another cat.Aside: Mikel told me all about this study in wonderful, disgusting detail but Immasummarize it for you: cats prefer a clean litter box over a dirty one. Not any breaking 16news there. But then a researcher made odorless fake ‘number 1’ and fake ‘number 2’,little decoy turds if you will, and between the real stinky stuff and the fake non-stinkystuff… You ready for this?Mikel: So the question was really, does a stinky box bother cats? And it turns out that whatthey really don't like is trying to, you know, basically, walk around these bombs in thebox that are creating probably a sensation that is unpleasant for them when they'rescratching and digging around. So the most important thing is just scooping it a lot.Alie: Scoop that box. What do you think the biggest myth about cats is? What's the biggestflimflam you’d debunk?Mikel: Let's see. Well, I think one of the things I always encourage people to recognize is thatcats are not small humans and they're not small dogs. I also think probably the biggestmyth is that cats can't be trained. A lot of people don't realize that you can change theirbehavior. A lot of cats end up in shelters because of behavior problems and a lot of thesebehavior problems are fixable. See, you’re surprised!Alie: I am surprised. Also, can you train them to use the toilet? Do they hate it?Mikel: Okay. They hate it. You can. I mean, you can train them to do anything under coercion,right? And I won't say they hate it. There's certainly the rare cat out there that justspontaneously uses the toilet. And if your cat does that, great. But I would say, still havethat litter box handy. I've definitely had clients who had trained their cat to use thetoilet and now their cat is peeing around the house. It's like, just give them a litter box.Aside: Or maybe if your cat is very fancy, give them a glitterbox. Just kidding that’s avery bad idea, not matter how into disco they are. And sidenote: I did some research tofind out if kitty glitter is a thing and found a blog post from a cat owner all about a newGlitterbox brand sparkly gold litter that promises ‘every scoop is like a treasure hunt.’And one might be inclined to fall for it, but the post was made on April the 1st and toreally, uh, gild the lily, the brand was named ‘Jester’ so yes, that was a prank, and no,disco shit boxes are not a thing. On the topic of falsehoods:Mikel: But back to this myth that cats can’t be trained. Probably one of the more commonreasons that we get called to help people is that their cat is, for example, waking themup at three in the morning for food, or to be let out, or just to be an asshole. It's actuallya relatively easy behavior to fix compared to things like cats fighting. Some of it istraining, and training your cat when to expect attention, when to expect food. And a lotof people inadvertently train their cats to wake them up. So it's actually that they'rereinforcing the behavior because typically when a cat is walking on someone's head atfour in the morning, or meowing for food, the person gets up and puts food downbecause they're like, “just shut the fuck up. I want to get back to sleep.”So in the short term, that's the quickest way to fix the problem. But in the long term,that's actually training the cat that “well, if you just persist long enough, your humanwill get up and give you what you want.” Whether it's food, or petting, attention. Samething with cats that get up on counters. Typically people go and chase the cat down or 17pick them up and put them on the floor. The cat jumps right back up, person picks themup, puts them on the floor again. Well guess who's having the time of his life? The cat. Heloves it. It's a game. And if your cat is bored, and under-stimulated, and doesn't haveother ways to get praise, attention, or other rewards, then they're going to do thingsthat piss you off.Alie: Oh, is that why they knock things off shelves?Mikel: Yeah, I mean, you know, a good clue is whether or not it happens when you're home ornot. If you're at work and your cat does not knock things off your shelves, but they onlydo it when you're home? They're doing it for attention.Aside: Never forget, your cat is a furry poltergeist who loves you. Or perhaps it’stheir spayed and neutered gonads trapped in a realm between the living and the deadthat cause mischief, who knows! Either way, quick PSA: spay and neuter your cats. Okay,so they want your attention, though…Mikel: And this gets back to setting up a good environment for your cat. So, the vertical spaceand bird watching, but also making sure your cat is getting daily exercise, whether that'swith a cat dancer type toy or taking them out on a harness for a walk.Alie: Do they hate that?Mikel: No, they love it.Alie: Really? I love a cat on a leash!Mikel: Yeah, our cat loves it. I mean, she's old so she just wants to go outside and, like, rollaround in the sun for 15 minutes and then come back inside. She's actually reallybummed now that it's winter; when it was, like, 95 out, she would just happily lay in thesun for an hour. And now if she wants to go outside, we take her out and she's like,“ummmm, it's broken. The heat's off. Can you turn the heat on out here?”Aside: So remember I mentioned that Mikel has written papers on what kind of playis the best for cats? Is it like… Sudoku? Is it having them jog behind you outside, chasingwith a feather wand attached to your fanny pack? Probably not.Mikel: For cats, a lot of play should be really more about the calculating their final pounce andnot just running around chasing the feather wand, but stalking it and watching it whileyou move it very slowly. Maybe you're acting like a wounded bird, or hiding behind apiece of furniture and shaking like you're terrified and then, woo! You swoop out andthat's your cat’s moment to pounce and kill. I jokingly call it kitty foreplay [swanky,deep-bass music plays in background] because I think when people play with their cats,they really just want to whip the toy around, and then have the cat get tired and done.[music fades] Whereas the cat is like, can we go as slow as possible? And, you know, justmove to the right a little bit, move to the left a little bit…Alie: There’s an arc to it. [laughs]Mikel: There is. It is a buildup for the cat to again, that perfect moment where they would behunting and killing. You really only have one chance to kill a bird, right? If you're a cat. If 18you fuck it up, that bird’s takin’ off. You really have to plan appropriately and get closeenough so you can make that last jump and like… get it.Alie: So that is what stimulates them. Their brains, and their muscles.Mikel: Yeah. And their body is really tuned into hunting. Their eyes are, you know, designed forhunting in, for example, lower light conditions, and to detect horizontal movementthat's about three meters away from them. So up close, their vision's really terrible.When you're holding your cat and all lovey eyes with them, you are just a blur, but theycan probably smell you very well. That's probably what they're most in tune with whenthey're that close to you.Alie: And are they nocturnal?Mikel: No. No. There crepuscular. [repetition of ‘crepuscular’] So they're active at dawn anddusk, which is when their prey is most active. Now, cats that are not given enough to doduring the day, I would say, are going to be what people would consider nocturnalbecause you haven't really taken advantage of their natural activity cycle. This gets backto that idea: your cat is keeping you up all night; it's because they're sleeping all day. Agreat time to engage your cat in play would be at dawn and dusk because that's theirnatural rhythm to be active. Certainly throughout the day it's good to keep themmoving, stimulated, not just snoozing all day. Then play with them at nighttime beforeyou go to bed. Maybe give them a snack before bedtime and that will help them sleepmore soundly through the night.Alie: Oohh, good to know. So, if you were sleeping all day, chances are you'd be up all nighttoo. Right? So there you go. Can I ask you questions from listeners?Mikel: Of course. I didn't know you had questions.Alie: I do! Do you have time?Mikel: Yeah!Alie: I let people on Patreon ask questions. The patrons wrote in. I've never gotten so manyquestions, so I’ve cat-egorized them as best I can. Oh my gosh. So this is like a lightninground. You can just answer as fast as you want, or fast as you can. Tina Rautio wants toknow: Why does my cat put her butthole in my face? [clip from a cat-meow version of‘Despacito’]Mikel: So that is how cats greet each other. Butt sniffing is an important way to getinformation. There you go. Yeah.Alie: It’s just a, “Heyyyyy!”Christopher Brewer wants to know: Best way to tame a feral cat?Mikel: So, as I talked about before, you know, you have the socialization window where if youcan get a cat when they're young you can really turn them into a lovely pet. Once they'reoutside of that window, it's not that the door shuts, it just is… you have to nudge it a lotharder to get it to open. [door creaking] So, if you have an adult cat who's truly never 19been socialized around people, then now you're not socializing. You’re doing what wecall counter-conditioning and desensitization where you’re just gradually getting themused to your presence and trying to associate it with things that they find pleasant.It would be like taming a wild animal. But it's going to be a long and slow road, and thatcat may only ever adapt to one or two people that they're very familiar with. So theways you would do that would be to build trust with something, gradually exposingyourself to them, keeping a distance at first and trying to pair your presence withsomething that they find pleasant, like food, typically tuna or something very high value.It would have to be like, bonus. It might be a very slow process. There have been somepeople that have found that rehabilitating an injured or sick cat has sped up the processand we don't know why that is, that's just anecdotal.It was something that John Bradshaw wrote about in his book Cat Sense. Otherwise, likeI said, you're really, literally, taming. The difference between socialization and taming isthat socialization implies that you're able to change their behavior when they're highlyplastic and able to be molded to your liking. Whereas after that door has shut, it's goingto be really just like, “you're going to love me because you're going to think of sashimiwhen you see me.”Alie: So just getting them used to you and associations that are good.Aside: I feel like this also works for people too. Like if every time you saw someoneyou were rad as hell to them, and you handed them a shepherd’s pie or a tastefullypotted succulent, they’d be like, “Whoa, you are dope. And now I like you.” One thingthat is not dope is toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection often linked to kitties. Accordingto the Centers for Disease Control, “Toxoplasmosis is considered to be a leading cause ofdeath attributed to foodborne illness in the United States. More than 40 million men,women, and children in the U.S. carry the Toxoplasma parasite, but very few havesymptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness.”Let’s get into this shit, in every way imaginable.Alie: A lot of people asked about toxoplasmosis. Oryx Beisa, Sarah Clark, Donn, Jen Durbin,and Ian Robertson, all kind of wanted to know: What's the deal with Toxoplasmagondii? Are cats unwittingly subjecting us to mind control, essentially?Mikel: This is definitely one of my… this is probably, actually, when you asked about the mythsabout cats that drive me crazy? This is one of them. Cat ownership is not considered tobe a risk factor for toxoplasmosis by the CDC. They don't recommend that you get rid ofa cat. Now, what is true is that cats’ digestive system is the optimum environment fortoxoplasmosis to reproduce. They are definitely associated with it. How people typicallyget it is not from cats directly, but from eating contaminated meat or vegetables thathave not been cleaned or prepared properly, which is probably from feces being… agarden where there's cat poop, there may be toxo in it. The best way to protect yourselffrom toxoplasmosis is to clean your cat's litter box every day because the oocysts needover 24 hours to hatch. So if the poop is fresh, it's good, you can just handle it, wash 20your hands after, and you're not going to be exposed to toxo. Of course, keeping yourcats indoors is probably the other safest way to avoid it.The research associating it with psychological disorders has… I'd say it's mixed. Therewas a pretty lengthy publication a couple of years ago out of Britain that showed, with alongitudinal study, no association of cat ownership and Toxoplasmosis with mentalhealth disorders. I think those stories get a lot of hype, and it really feeds into this ideathat cats are somehow fucking with us because they're trying to control our minds.Certainly people who do have toxo, for example, the men find the odor of cat peepleasant, which is weird. Rats that are infected with it also are not afraid of cat urine,which is not normal.So, we know that it can have the effects on the brain. I don't question that at all. It'sreally the direct link from having a cat to getting toxoplasmosis that, kind of, drives mecrazy because, again, the CDC does not consider it a risk. Of course, if you areimmunocompromised or pregnant, then you have to take extra care about handling catfeces. But again, if you clean the box every day you are at zero risk, basically. It's reallymore about, perhaps, the link between your bad hygiene and your mental health. Disson those people. But again, it makes it makes for a good click bait so I think people reallylatch onto this story quite easily.Alie: That's, that's such a good flimflam to debunk. I'm so glad that they asked. Jaimee Drewand Jen Durbin both want to know about drool. Jaimee Drew’s 11-year-old, Meredithasks: Why does my cat drool when he's happy?Mikel: [laughs] There's different reasons that cats may drool and they may be as simple asthey're missing a tooth, so there's more opportunity for the drool to drip out. Or they'rerelaxed so their jaw muscle isn't as tight, so the drool can flow more freely, much likewhen you're falling asleep and you're on a plane, for example, your mouth’s hangingopen and then you're like [sucking in drool sound].Alie: Been there. Done that.Mikel: So I think it's probably just a sign of relaxation. It could be a sign of a dental problem ifit's really stinky and your cat does not seem to be happy when they're drooling. Soduring their yearly checkup, I would say, have your vet check their teeth.Aside: Sidenote: I double checked on this and yep — just a sign of relaxation andslack-jawed comfort. Some cats drool when they’re happy, some don’t. But unless it’ssudden could be due to a dental issue, just look at it as mouth tears of joy.Alie: But it might just be happiness! Which is amazing. Let's see, I had several people ask thisquestion. Kellie Windsor, Andrea Motyka, Juan Pedro Martinez, Christopher Brewer, andSarah Walker all wanted to know, essentially, about biscuits. Why do cats knead yourlap or their bed? What are they doing when they're making biscuits? [jingle from old TVcommercial, “So I’m bakin’ big ol’ biscuiiits” followed by the Pillsbury Doughboy giggle]Mikel: They're trying to get milk out of you. You are a giant boob.Alie: [laughs] What are they… But if they’re adults, are they just hungry or are they…?21Mikel: Yeah. So, one thing that has possibly happened through domestication, which is typical,is that we select for juvenile traits, right? We keep our animals somewhat stunted,emotionally, developmentally, through domestication. And honestly, I don't know iflions and tigers make biscuits. I don’t know. That’s a great question. Actually, I need tofind out.Aside: Quick aside: Do tigers make biscuits? They sure as shit do, my friends! Ifound an article on Mental Floss with Susan Bass of the Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Floridaand she says yep! But they don’t purr. According to an article by the Library of Congress,lions, leopards, jaguars, tigers, snow leopards, do not exhibit true purring but can makea purr-like sound. But wild cats like bobcats, cheetah, Eurasian lynx, pumas, andwildcats, they purr. But let’s get back to biscuits.Mikel: But you know, the kneading or biscuits, muffins, whatever you'd like to call it, is howkittens get milk from mom. And it's adorable when you see them doing it, but they'rekneading the mammary glands to get milk out. For some animals they stop engaging injuvenile behaviors and others continue throughout their life, and it tends to be at timeswhere they're happy, right? Time with mom is a very happy time. There's a lot ofoxytocin flowing, there's a lot of purring going on, which we believe stimulates oxytocin.We always just say they're, kind of, in the ‘mommy zone’ when they're nursing. And sothey might be trying to comfort themselves or they might just be very, very happy.Alie: [adoring] They might just like you?Mikel: Yeah. I know a lot of people, it bothers them because mostly because it hurts if theirkitty’s nails are sharp. Either trim your cat's nails or get a nice fuzzy blanket to put onyour lap when your cat does it, and then it won't make its way to your legs.Alie: Now let's talk about cats and drugs. Christina, Don Schwartz, Dani Buchheister, BrentMonseur, Madeline Heising, and Mary Fuller all asked, what is the story with catnip?What happens to their brains? Like, are they stoned? What's going on?Mikel: Another question where we don't really know the neuroscience behind it. Because as faras I know, one, you can't at this stage do like a functional MRI on a cat and see live whattheir brain’s doing without, probably, doing some pretty heavy invasive stuff, in whichcase you might be screwing up the catnip response. The chemical composition of catnipis pretty similar to some of the chemical compositions of females’ estrus… juices, Iguess, for lack of better term. [clip of Willy Wonka saying, “That’s juice.” With Mr.Beauregarde replying, “Juice?!” followed by a moist splatting sound.] Not all cats respondto catnip. It's a genetic trait that seems to be an autosomal dominant trait.But cats who don't respond to catnap often respond to other plants. Catnip is not theonly catnip out there. There's Japanese catnip, which is silver vine, which more catsrespond to silver vine than catnip. And you're starting to see… It's hitting the market. Soif you're not hip to silver vine yet, don't worry, it will be at a pet store near you beforeyou know it.Alie: It's like a matcha latte. Thanks, Japan!22Mikel: Some cats also love… Valerian root and honeysuckle are two other very commonly usedolfactory stimulants for cats. It seems to have different effects on different cats. So again,your cat is an individual. First of all, your cat may not even respond. About 60 percent ofcats respond to catnip. Your cat might be the 40 percent of straight-edge kitties that arenot interested. Thank you very much. But it's always worth a try.Some cats get more worked up and excited on catnip and other cats get more mellowand just, kind of, roll around. Some cats like to eat catnip. Some just like to sniff it. It'sone of those things where… Know your cat - are they a happy drunk or a mean drunk?Use accordingly.If you leave it out all the time, they do stop responding as strongly to it. We typicallyrecommend that you store it in a jar, maybe put all their catnip toys in a jar with freshcatnip and then they can remain potent, then when you take them out again later, they’llbe excited again. But if you leave it out all the time, it will lose its excitement.But as far as what is going on in their brains, I don't think anyone's looked at thatcarefully. There’s been a lot of studies of their behavior while they're using catnip. Andwe typically see things like rolling. Some of the behaviors are playful, some of them aresexual or similar to sexual behaviors, like the, kind of rolling, and presenting typebehaviors, and some are just very relaxed and mellow. I think there's still a lot of debateas to whether it induces play or something else.Alie: Or if it's like Viagra.Aside: Okay, I did look this up, and while up to a third of all cats just aren’t into it,they lack the gene, they’re like, “get this trashy mint out of my face,” I did find onesource that said some male cats, when exposed to catnip, get a little too rambunctious,bordering on aggression. Tournt up on the herb!Alie: Katie Cobb and Bob Ogden both want to know: Why do cats love sitting in boxes? Whatis it with their boxes?Mikel: Okay. It gets back to the predator and prey. They need like a safe blind where, basically,they can spy on the world without being detected. It gives them a sense of security as faras we can tell. Cats typically, for example, they're going to be hiding in a shrub, or likebehind some grasses, and so it gives them some protection; offers heat, which is alwaysa bonus. The smaller the box is the more heat it's gonna conduct. We also know that…Actually there was a study that showed that cats that got boxes in animal shelters wereless stressed out than cats who did not. So, boxes can be a real place of security for catsand, again, it probably makes them feel safe. It's not like there's some magical - like yourcat loves Amazon or anything. It's really just they like being enclosed and having thislittle sense of security where they can see what's going on but they're partly hidden.Alie: Oh my gosh, that's so cute though.Aside: And yes, tigers, lions and other big cats at sanctuaries just hang out in boxes.It’s a cat in box, just real big ones. How many videos did I watch? One, got my answer for 23this aside, and then I continued watching at least 8 more large cats playing in largeboxes. Just wasting some quality American time on the Internet.Okay, let’s talk bird murder. Adam Hallihan and AJ Chlebnik said: Do outdoor cats reallykill billions of birds each year? How bad is this for the environment, really? They heardifferent things from cat advocates vs. bird advocates. Curious.Mikel: Okay. So cats do get 100% of the blame for bird deaths even though they're not 100%responsible for bird deaths. A lot of bird deaths are happening because of humanencroachment on bird territory. First of all, we should recognize that cats are not theonly killer of birds. Rats are also a huge killer of birds. So, what do we do about catskilling birds? I mean, I firmly believe that people should keep their cats indoors if theyhave pet cats. Let's reduce the damage, and be responsible pet owners, and take yourcat out on a harness, or build a catio for your cat so they can enjoy some fresh air andoutdoor time without being loose and catching birds.Aside: I’m sorry, just had to bust in and say WHAT IS A CATIO? I had never heardthis word before and you bet your buttcrack I looked it up: it’s like a mesh enclosure;kind of a tasteful cage that either connects inside the house via a window, or tunnel, orcat door so they can just chill outside, but enclosed. It’s a catio. It’s a fairly new term; itsWikipedia is just three scant sentences. But I did a little digging and like all qualitytrends/lifestyle movements, it may have originated in Portland. The Portland Audubonsociety does an annual Catio Tour, so you have until September, Portland folks, to gearup for the next one. Okay, aside from a hip indoor/outdoor living space, what else canprotect birds and other backyard critters?Mikel: There are some products on the market that are supposed to reduce cat's ability topredate on birds. There's like these little ruffled collars that, if you look on the websites,the cats all look so pissed. Like, “I can’t believe you fucking put this thing on me.” Thatcat might leave a bird on your pillow if they can still catch the bird. So there are somestrategies that people who insist on letting their cats go outside could try to reduce theamount that their cats kill.There's been some research suggesting that the birds that are killed by cats are typicallyweaker. And, you know, I'd say the models that suggest that cats are killing like 10billion birds a year, it's hard to know really what's going on and how much of that iscats. And I'm not trying to say that cats do not want to kill birds, but they're typicallyharder for cats to catch the mice. Some cats are generalists; they'll kill anything thatmoves. But a lot of cats are specialists, they have a preferred prey and as long as thatprey is available, they'll hunt that. If they prefer lizards, they will hunt lizards as long aslizards are available. Big picture: it's complicated. I don't think the cat should get all ofthe blame.Alie: Cat apologist.Mikel: Yeah. And I also agree that we should make as many efforts to keep as many catsindoors as possible. 24Alie: Keep kitties inside!Mikel: Certainly, cats will still hunt even if they're fed, typically, but they'll maybe be less quickto hunt and kill. That's another argument for managing feral colonies instead of justletting them propagate and/or trying to exterminate them, which is usually not aneffective strategy.Alie: And it's also very sad. A big question I got from so many people; Ashley Burgamy, OryxBeisa, Ben Hollin, Chelsey, Shea Goddard, Anna Thompson, Micah Eckard. All want toknow: Will cats really just eat their owner if they die alone in their apartment?Mikel: I think most of us will eat someone if we're alone in an apartment with them and theydie and we don't have anything else to eat. Yes, actually when I worked at the shelter,we did have a kitty who came in, who… her owner had died and she apparently nibbledon the nose.Alie: Oh no! Just the nose?Mikel: As far as we were told by animal control. You know, it happens. You're starving. DonnerParty? I don't know what to say. Your dog will do it too, so…Alie: Really? Okay, so you're pretty much just, you are sashimi for whatever animal lives inyour home.Mikel: If they are stuck without food and you die, you are going to become food. We are meat.Alie: Okay, so yeah, your cat’s gonna eat your dead body.Mikel: Absolutely.Alie: What do you care? You're dead anyway! Yeah. [laughs]Mikel: Do you want them to die too?! I mean, they're just trying to stay alive until they can getanother home.Alie: I know! Look at it this way. You're feeding the cat, even if you're not able to feed the cat.Mikel: And it's like, you know, environmentally friendly.Alie: What else are you going to do with your body?Aside: Hey entrepreneurs: consider a niche burial service that involves having one’sbody dehydrated and made into pellets. So, I did look this up and boy oh boy… whew!There’s a lot of dark stories from paramedics available on the internet if you want toscar your brain but essentially, a cat will start eating you the same day, usually going forthe nose, lips and eyes first. A dog may or may not eat you but they DEFINITELY do eattheir owners. SO MANY confirmed cases. Apparently, German Shepherds are way morelikely to tuck in a bib and dive right in while you’re still warm; and there have beenreports of dogs who ate their dead owners down to the skeletons, even one stashing abone under a pillow on the couch, just to enjoy later. So yes, dogs will certainly eat offyour nose, despite your faith.25Mikel: I really love that so many people are converging on the same question. It's kind offascinating.Alie: I know. So many people. The last two questions… because I have enough questions to sithere with you for, literally, like all day, but I understand that you do have a life. Last twoquestions I always ask, what is the worst thing about your job or the thing that yousecretly hate about cats?Mikel: [laughs] I don't think there's anything I hate about cats!Alie: [teasing] Oh, come on.Mikel: Um, vomiting.Alie: Yeah… Any way to prevent hairball vomiting?Aside: This was also a question from patron Sandra Kirby.Mikel: Brush your cat. One thing we know is that vomiting cats is actually not normal. I thinkpeople really normalized vomiting, but we believe that it's more likely a medical orstress related issue. But as far as my job, you know, I think one thing when I startedworking with cats, people would be like, “oh my God, you have the best job, just like,petting kittens all day! Oh my God!” And it's true, I do get to pet a lot of kittens andcertainly when I worked in the shelter petted a lot of kittens and cats. But it's reallyabout dealing with people. So much of my work is… Even now I'm dealing with researchparticipants, and you know, I need something from them. I need them to collect data forme in an accurate way, and I need their help. And when I'm dealing with clients who arehaving behavior problems with their cats, I'm not dealing with their cats; I'm trying toget them to change, typically, their behavior in order to change their cat's behavior.So, probably the most challenging aspect is often the human element because behaviorchange is hard, and trying to get someone to scoop the litter box every day when they'vebeen skipping it once a week all of their life is not easy. Or getting them to change theirhabits when their cat is waking them up at four in the morning and telling them, “youhave to ignore your cat until he stops and it might take a couple of weeks.” A lot ofpeople break down. I've had people cry, you know.It's easy to make light of when people are having behavior problems with their cats butI've definitely experienced, for example, people who basically got divorced over theirpet, or stop sleeping in the same bed because they have two cats that hate each otherand they don't want either cat to sleep alone. So they're sleeping separately with theirtwo cats. Or, people who are afraid they're going to have to put their cat to sleepbecause they can't live with the behavior problem, whether their cat has ruined theirhouse and they can't have people come over anymore because their house smells likepee, or you know, their cat is aggressive to strangers and so they don't feel comfortablehaving people over.I definitely think there are so many joys and benefits of having pets, but for people whoare experiencing problems there can be a lot of guilt, and shame, and they feel likethey're a bad parent when it's not necessarily them. So it can be really hard to deal with 26that side where people are going through a lot of pain, and by the time people reach outfor help they're, kind of, at their wit’s end. Sometimes you're just the last stop on theirway to the shelter. I've literally had people call like, “I'm driving to the shelter, if youdon't call me right back and fix this problem, the cat's going…” you know, basically,going to be gotten rid of. So that can be a lot of pressure. That is probably the hardestpart of this kind of work, is when you're seeing the complexity of the human-animalrelationship. Sometimes they need someone who's a human psychiatrist and not a catbehaviorist.Alie: So the hardest thing about cats is people.Mikel: Exactly.Alie: What's the best thing about cats? [Jeopardy’s “Think!” plays in background] Especially ifyou want to say anything to any cat haters out there.Mikel: [record scratch] They're fucking cute. I've never met a cat I didn't think was cute. I likethe mystery, personally. They're not as blatant as, like, the dog who's like, “I LOVEYOU!!!” Cats, you gotta work for it a little bit and I definitely appreciate that. I like thatthey still have that little bit of wildness. We're still asking, “are they domesticated ornot? We can't even tell!” Because they're a little bit wild, but they're also tame enoughthat they're curled up in your lap and purring. [cat purring] I think purring is magic. It'sjust a very soothing and wonderful little trick they have.Alie: Do they do that in the wild? Same with meowing? Or do they just really do that tocommunicate with us?Mikel: Moms and kittens will purr when they're nursing. We think, typically, positive situationswhere there's some love going on. And they'll also purr when they're distressed, so it'snot just a positive. It might have self-soothing aspects to it. You will see cats and painwho are dying that will purr as well. But again, look at the context. If your cat’s not dyingand they’re purring, they're probably happy. If they've got a broken leg and they'repurring… not happy.Alie: Do they meow just to communicate with us?Mikel: Yeah. Meowing is something that they primarily do with humans. [DJ airhorns playX-Files theme] The communication they do with other cats is, typically, either moreantagonistic, like yowling, growling, hissing, shrieking; or smaller, shorter, chirpingwould be a positive sound that cats would do to each other. But meowing seems to besomething they reserve primarily for humans.Aside: So cats, not dicks. Just a little afraid. And also they know how to play us, andthat’s why we love them.Alie: Where can people find you?Mikel: I have a blog, CatsAndSquirrels.com. I try to report on there about… primarily aboutscience related to cats and squirrels because they’re my two favorite species. I'm onTwitter @mikel_maria. My business website is FelineMinds.com. 27Alie: So if someone needed some consulting they could…Mikel: They could go to FelineMinds.Alie: Okay. I have a feeling you're going to have a lot of cat questions. Thank you so much fordoing this!Mikel: You’re welcome! Thanks for having me. This was super fun.Alie: Oh my God. I could seriously ask you questions all day. Thank you so much.Oh hey, it’s that blueberry bagel that tastes like onions ‘cause it pressed its face into an everythingbagel. Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. It’s the middle of January, and here in thenorthern hemisphere, lips are chapped, feet are cold, parkas are on. I’m here to give you a snow job.But first, thank you to everyone who supports on Patreon, and who gets merch, including the newblack t-shirts (yes!) at OlogiesMerch.com. Of course, thanks to everyone who rates and subscribes,who leaves reviews on iTunes, you know I read them. You know I read them. For example, thisweek, thank you to Evie, who said,In the hopes of Alie noticing me [heeyyy], I gotta say that this podcast just recently got methrough some pretty bad flying anxiety. So thank you.Thank you for taking me into the sky with you, Evie. Also, EvanDK, I hope you and your pops arefeeling okay.Okay, so: snow. Snow! Not just snow, but big cold crumbly scary dangerous avalanches. What thehell are they? I searched far and wide for a snow expert, and I connected with a dude who got hisPh.D. in Environmental Science and Management from University of California, Santa Barbara, aplace Steven Ray Morris and I both attended, but this guy is primarily based up near MammothMountain, which is technically a giant lava dome complex. Freakin’ volcano, near Yosemite. It’s chill.He does not live in L.A. because hello, there’s no snow here. But he would be passing through LAXon a six-hour layover. I coincidentally was also flying into LAX that night. We had plans to meet upin a terminal, and then my flight was delayed because of snow. Cute, snow! Cute!So we made another plan. He had another layover at LAX a few weeks later, right before theholidays, and I drove down there, and I waited on a bench outside LAX for him, with my Zoomrolling, to rendezvous at high noon and talk snow. One issue: my phone was dying. And LAX is huge.Some days I’m like, why am I such garbage? Also, just a little audio note. As mentioned, this wasrecorded on a bench at LAX, and so there were a lot of ambient noises that we were competing with,and so as not to be annoying, we tried to cut around them as best we could, but it’s a little bit lesssmooth than most episodes. If this is the very, very first episode you’re listening to, the audio is alittle different on this one, please bear with us, forgive us, the contents are totally worth it.As you’re going to hear, it was an adventure. You’re about to learn about the beauty andarchitecture of snowflakes, why they’re so bright white, what to do if you’re stranded in snow, howavalanches happen, how to survive one, Digging Out Your Car 101, and the best snow for a snowballfight. Also, how climate change affects snowpack, and the really riveting backstory of skier,avalanche expert, and Snow Hydrologist, Dr. Ned Bair.2----------Pre-interview:I thought that was Ned, that wasn’t Ned. My phone is at 2%. I am at the appointedmeeting place. It is 11:59. I do not see Ned. My phone has 2% for us to meet up witheach other before this gets real tragic. [laughing] Oh, god. How was it not plugged in?My lord.My phone is now at one percent. I see someone walking. Please be Ned, please be Ned.Are you Ned? Yeeessss! [laughing] Hi Ned!Interview:Alie Ward: And where did you grow up? Because you’re based in Santa Barbara? Or you workout of UCSB.Dr. Ned Bair: I do, I work for UCSB, I live in Mammoth Lakes.Alie: And where are you from, originally?Ned: Alexandria, Virginia.Alie: Do they have snow there?Ned: No, not much.Alie: Ohhh! How did this happen?Ned: I grew up skiing in Wintergreen, Virginia, a thousand vertical feet. Something like thirtyinches of annual snowfall. I went to school in Maine, I went to Bowdoin College and skiedmore there, and then after college, I went, and my parents weren’t too happy about this,became a ski patroller and did that for ten years.Alie: Were they like, can you not break all of your bones?Ned: Yeah, well, that’s not really what they wanted me to go to college to do. [both laughing] Andyeah, not the safest job either. But I loved it.Alie: Have you been called a ski bum by your family?Ned: Yeah, yeah. I’ve always had that. I’ve wanted to live in a ski town for as long as I canremember. I’ve sort of managed to do that with a professional career. I wind up traveling afair bit, but also just a lot of time on the computer.Alie: How did you make the leap from being ski patrol, for you said, ten years, to – you have aPh.D. in Snow Hydrology.3Ned: Yes.Alie: How did you go from like air quotes ski bum to doctor snow dude?Ned: It’s kind of a long story, but I was working as a patroller, and part of that was I was doing myPh.D. while I was still ski patrolling at the end. But I had a friend on ski patrol who was sortof a mentor for me, his name is Walter Rosenthal, he was an old patroller. He was in his midfifties. He kind of took me under his wing and taught me a lot about snow and digging thesemassive snow pits. Sierra snowpack is really deep. It varies, but it can be very deep, and sowe would be digging these pits and doing these crystal identification and stuff like that, Imean really deep, and he just loved it. He’s probably one of the only people I’ve ever metwho liked to dig more in the snow than to do anything else. He’s kind of like a humanbackhoe.Anyway, Walter was my friend on ski patrol, and he taught me a lot about the snow. I waspatrolling, I was kind of looking for something a little more cerebral to do. I loved workingas a ski patroller. I should say this – Walter had a history, he was a scientist also, alsoworked at UC Santa Barbara, and he had done a bunch of work with remote sensing, andsatellite based mapping of the snowpack, and stuff that I’m doing now. But what he reallyliked to do is avalanche research. Which there’s almost no funding for in the U.S. really. It’swhat I like to do, it’s what I wrote my dissertation on.Walter got an NSF grant with his advisor Jeff Dozier to study centering mechanisms in thesnowpack. So, how snow grains bond together. He was looking at soluble impurities in thesnowpack and using the scanning electron microscope and looking at the geometricstructure, and now the necks form between them and stuff like that.Anyway, Walter had just got this NSF grant, and then in April of 2006 he was killed withthree other ski patrollers when a volcanic vent on Mammoth Mountain collapsed.Alie: Oh, my god!Ned: Yeah. It was a really rough time. It happened right next to me.Alie: [gasps]Ned: I was there when it happened. And he was actually killed trying to rescue the otherpatrollers. It was really, it was a tough time in my life. An experience that I have had a reallyhard time getting over. But, anyway, Walter’s advisor Jeff came to me and asked me if Iwanted to go to grad school on his NSF grant that no longer had a Ph.D. student to do theresearch.Alie: Wow. What an impact that must have had on you!4Ned: It did. It had a pretty big impact on me. After college I was a ski patroller, and I was aclimbing guide, and I was kind of a climbing bum, ski bum. Pretty soon after that I gotmarried and started not living out of my truck as much. Now I have two little kids. It was atough experience. I guess I should mention, James Juarez and Scott McAndrews were thetwo other patrollers who were killed.Aside: While fencing off the area from skiers, Scotty and James fell through the snowtwenty feet into the volcanic vent, and Walter, who wasn’t supposed to be working, but hadreturned because of the storm, went after Scotty and James to save them. All three died ofasphyxiation in the volcanic gasses, namely the heavier CO2. Several others were injured inthe rescue efforts. And I just learned that when volcanic gasses reach noxious strengths,they’re called a mazuku, which in Swahili means ‘evil wind’. It’s dangerous.Ned: So, if you ever ski at Mammoth Mountain, there’s a thing called a fumarole, it’s on ChairThree area, and it spews out volcanic gasses. Hydrogen sulfide, which is really toxic, lots ofcarbon monoxide, carbon dioxide. It’s sort of fine if it’s not capped over, if it’s open andventing, but this year was a really large snow year, this was April of 2006, and it actuallycapped over for the first time that a lot of people who had been there for decades couldremember. These gasses sort of just sat there and actually formed an underground chamberthat we didn’t really know, and the snow bridge collapsed. We were pulling up fencing,because there’s fencing to keep skiers out of the fumarole.Aside: There are tons of videos on YouTube of skiers and snowboarders stopping at thisfenced off plume to sort of wonder at it, and many pay their respects. A stone memorial isup at Mammoth Summit to remember the three, and even ten years after the incident,hundreds gathered at Mammoth to observe the anniversary. The community is still prettyrocked by it.Alie: Did you have a hard time because it was maybe such a visceral and traumatic experience, togo back to this kind of science? Or did it make you more passionate about the safety of it?Ned: I think both. It’s sort of a complicated question. I wasn’t going to change my life radicallyand go off and live in a city and do that. I wouldn’t have been happy doing that. But yeah, itcertainly made me think a lot about the mountains and taking risks. This snow bridgecollapsed right next to me. It was a couple feet away. So, it could have very easily been mefalling into the fumarole.Alie: Wow. And you’re a young person, too.Ned: Yeah, I was twenty-six.Alie: So what is it about snow that you love? What keeps bringing you back to it?5Ned: Growing up, it was always sort of an ephemeral thing and I didn’t get to see it very much. Ithink all kids love snow. It’s obviously, no school, at least in the DC area, so it has nice earlymemories and impressions for me. I think later on – well, I loved the avalanche part of it.The avalanche world is fascinating and there are a lot of avenues that haven’t been exploredscientifically.Aside: This is where I find out what ski patrolling means. I honestly thought it was just likebuzzing around the slopes, making sure everyone was okay, kind of like a lifeguard, but withno Speedos, and more skis. Turns out, I did not know anything about ski patrolling.Ned: You go out with explosives, and you set off avalanches –Alie: Wait.Ned: - and you throw dynamite out of your hand.Alie: Oh, I didn’t know that!Ned: Yeah!Alie: I thought you were just making sure no one bailed.Ned: No, no no no. You do active avalanche control. Shoot howitzers…Alie: Oh my God!Ned: Throw dynamite. It’s fun.Aside: A howitzer, by the way, is a friggin’ World War II cannon, you guys. It’s a cannon.[far away voice] I had to look it up.Ned: Avalanches are very difficult to predict, and it’s not always so clear what causes a reallylarge one versus a small one. They’re just sort of spectacular, too, just the size of them.[thundering avalanche sound] The debris, and the large blocks. The damage they can cause,you can see all kinds of markings on… You know, mostly in the Sierra, and most of UnitedStates, most of these happen in wilderness areas, so it’s trees that are destroyed. [morethundering sounds] It’s not like in the Alps, where there’s more infrastructure, they have alot of history of damage to buildings and things like that.Aside: This is no joke. Each year, around a hundred people are killed by Alpine avalanches,but due to really crazy snowfall lately, twenty-six lives have been lost, just this past month.Just a few days ago, two ski patrollers in France were killed detonating explosives to triggeran avalanche. So, this shit is risky.6Alie: How many avalanches are there per year, do you think?Ned: In Mammoth? I don’t know, a couple thousand.Alie: Really?!Ned: YeahAlie: Oh my god, I had no idea.Ned: Yeah, when they’re triggered like that, you have a lot more of them. Throughout the U.S., Idon’t know, a hundred thousand a year, something like that.Alie: My god. What’s the death toll there?Ned: Well it’s been going down. It’s in sort of the mid-twenties. It’s actually been staying steadyor going down, which is probably due to a number of factors: airbags, better education,better awareness. The avalanche centers do a great job with warning people during thesehigh snowfall periods, and other times when metamorphism has produced layering that’sunstable.Alie: Wow.Aside: Okay. More on those airbags in a bit. As for avalanches, these “metamorphisms inlayering” just mean that there’s less stability with a snow shelf, depending on what kind oflayers are underneath it. Maybe some wetter, warmer snow, or a layer of refrozen ice kindof stacking and stacking, kind of like an icy club sandwich. So, a steep slope, heavy snowcover, a weak layer in the snow, plus some kind of trigger, and you have a slide that can varyfrom pretty harmless Size 1, to a Size 2, that can bury a person. A 3 can bury a car, and a 4can destroy structures and go up to 80 miles per hour within a few seconds. Which is abouttwice as fast as my 2007 Prius, and thus deserves much more respect. [wimpy car hornbeeping]Ned: They’re exciting, but also, just snow is a really fascinating material. As Walter always usedto say, snow is hot, which means that it’s very close to its melting temperature, almosteverywhere on Earth. Because Earth is pretty warm, compared to the rest of the planets inour solar system. Well, at least the ones past Earth.Alie: Going back to a really basic question: what is snow? What’s the deal with snowflakes? Arethey all unique? If I know nothing about snow, what are the basics? I know this is a stupidquestion, but I don’t care.Ned: Right. My advisor, Jeff Dozier, he had a thing where he went to Disney for the Frozen movie[clip from Frozen, slowed down: “Let it go! Let it go!”] he had some consulting work where he 7showed up and gave them some pointers on snowflakes, which I thought were pretty good.And Carl Berklund [phonetic] who’s actually also on my Ph.D. committee, I thought betweenthem they had some pretty good points.Aside: Are you ready for this beautiful icy point? It’s going to melt your brains.Ned: Jeff made the point that snowflakes grow by accretion, meaning condensation nuclei, dust,they grow out of that, so you can’t have ones with holes in the middle, which you see a lot.Especially around now, when people are making snowflake decorations for Christmas.Alie: Yeah. [laughs]Ned: So, no holes in the middle. They have to have six sides. Okay, no pentagons or anything likethat. They grow from six-sided hexagonal water crystals.Aside: [far-away sounding voice] So if a kindergartner is out there making a papersnowflake with a hole in the middle, definitely yell at them. Just mercilessly. Becausefrankly, they’re never going to learn otherwise. Humiliate them. [Regular voice] Don’t dothat.Also, for a four-second lesson on hexagonal water crystals, how’s this? Water is twohydrogens, and an oxygen atom, and because of how much molecules slow down in the cold,the hydrogen bonds allow the water molecules to link up in such a way that they form ahexagonal lattice structure. Which is, of course, why some snowflakes have six sides!Okay, what else did the scientist tell the mouse at Disney? [slowed down recording of Frozen:“Let it goooooo”]Ned: Carl also made the point that you cannot yell and cause a snow avalanche. It doesn’t happen.I guess it happened in the movie Heidi…Aside: I just spent like an hour digging all over for this Heidi clip, but he may have beenthinking of another mountain movie, which, incidentally, an I Love Lucy episode cited.[Clip from I Love Lucy]Lucy: Now don’t make a sound.Ricky: What’s the matter, honey?Lucy: All that snow hanging over our heads! A loud noise would cause an avalanche!Ricky: [laughing]Lucy: It’s true, I read it in a book! And you remember that picture Seven Brides forSeven Brothers? Yeah, that’s right! Somebody shot a pistol and it caused a great bigavalanche! Yeah. Now, don’t anybody move!8Okay, also, I went and looked up Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and from what I can gather,it involves a bunch of related horny frontiersmen who romantically straight-up kidnapwomen. So, I feel like yes, this pistol triggering an avalanche plot point is problematic, butnot as much as its kind of lighthearted musical take on human trafficking.Ned: You want to try and stop that urban, rural legend from perpetuating.Alie: So that’s a big debunker of flimflam. That’s flimflam. You can’t scream and cause anavalanche.Ned: Nope.Alie: Okay. So scream your head off in the mountains if you need to.Ned: Ahhhh, yes.Alie: Okay, good to know. Sometimes that’s why you go to the mountains, is just to scream yourhead off. And then you go back and say, “Everything’s fine!”Ned: Yeah.Alie: Right? Okay, where does snow form in the atmosphere? Does it form right above our heads?Does it form waaayyy above us? When does a snowflake become a snowflake?Ned: Pretty high up. It depends on the level of the clouds and how deep the storm is, and wherethe moisture is. This is all the lower atmosphere, if you’re an atmospheric scientist, but forpeople like me who study what’s going on, on the ground, pretty high up. Kilometers[laughs] above our heads.Alie: Ooo!Ned: It starts off frozen actually, because it’s cold up there. But it turns to rain if it’s not coldenough.Aside: So, to recap: water vapor and cold temperatures turns to ice crystals around a pieceof dust or pollen, aka “condensation nuclei”, and then it falls through the air and tumblesand grows. And in warmer air, it’ll melt a little at the edges, and form clumps with otherflakes, resulting in heavier, wet, fluffy snow. And if it falls through colder air, it’s less likelyto stick together, and it falls as smaller, drier, and powdery snow.Also, side note, I just went down some YouTube holes trying to see different sizesnowflakes, and one thing I didn’t need to know about, was a video of a guy silentlyscratching dandruff. Which, quote, falls like snow. And has forty-thousand views, mine nowbeing one of them. Human beings. We’re all a little different, and to each their own.9Alie: Snowflakes being unique, yes or no?Ned: Um, yes. You can find snowflakes that are pretty similar. But they all grow by this prettycomplex accretion process, where there’s just a lot of water vapor condensing, it’s called“deposition” when it’s going straight from vapor to solid like that. Usually what people arereferring to, I think, when they talk about how no two snowflakes are alike, is that theweather is kind of constantly changing, so that causes a difference in the crystal “habits”they call them, that are coming out of the sky. Wilson Bentley was taking pictures ofsnowflakes over a hundred years ago, or around a hundred years, in Vermont. There’s beenall sorts of people photographing snowflakes.Aside: Wilson Bentley of Vermont, by the by, was a pioneer in the field of teeny, tinyweather photography, and snapped his first snowflake picture in the late 1880s, byattaching a camera to a microscope. He famously was the one that argued that no two snowcrystals were alike. And then he died at the age of 66 after walking six miles in a blizzard. Ohman. Snow is a bitchy mistress. But what makes all of these [slowed down] glimmmering icyflakes so fancy?Ned: It has to do with the temperature and super-saturation, so relative humidity. You get sort ofa different snowflake form, and they can be anything from dendrites, like the classicsnowflake, to needles, to capped columns, to there’s a number of different sectored plates.Alie: I didn’t know that!Ned: Ken Libbrecht has a nice coffee table book of snowflakes.Aside: Okay, so Ken Libbrecht is a Cal Tech physics professor, who is probably the world’sbest snowflake photographer. He can say, hands down, it’s him. Among his many books are:Snowflakes: Winter’s Frozen Artistry, and Ken Libbrecht’s Field Guide to Snowflakes. If you’relike “Yesss! I’m ordering those right now! But Alie Ward, I need to see photographsimmediately, before my books are delivered!” I understand, and I direct you toward hiswebsite snowcrystals.com, which also lays out all the different types of snowflakes such asstellar dendrites, which sounds like a European electronica band, but they’re actually theclassic pretty star-shaped ones. And then there’s capped columns, which are snowflakesthat look like a hand weight, from the gym, or like a tiny, tiny icy Thai fighter, and thenthere’s these shimmering diamond dust crystals. There are triangular snowflakes. So,looking through the gallery, one can’t help but say, [echoey voice effect] “Snowflakes! I hadno idea!”Alie: Are you ever irked by people using the term snowflake politically, as an insult?Ned: [laughs] I haven’t thought about that. No, it doesn’t bother me. I guess, you know, it makessense. It’s a funny question. The classic snowflake, that we were talking about, the dendrite,those are delicate, and they do fracture and break apart easily. That’s not so much the case 10in the Sierra for instance, or most mountain ranges where it’s windy. The snow that fallsthere [clip of wind building up in the background], well for one thing, it’s not really falling, it’susually coming sideways, because the winds are so strong. There’s a process calledfragmentation by the wind, where the crystals are mechanically blown apart.Alie: Oh, wow.Ned: So, they might start off in the clouds as nice dendrites, but by the time they get to thesurface, they’re blown apart.Aside: Kind of like how, at the beginning of the night, you might be perfectly orderly. Just acomplex and symmetrical vision. But then, it’s 1 a.m., and one shoe broke, and an eyelashfell off, and you got redeposited at a diner, instead of a disco. If you will.Ned: Snowflakes can actually be pretty durable, and they look different. They’re small, they’relike little specks, versus larger – you know, all snowflakes probably look small to people.Alie: Right.Ned: Some are much smaller, like an order of magnitude smaller, especially when they’redisaggregated like that.Alie: What’s happening with a hail stone? What’s the difference there?Ned: A hail stone is something that’s liquid, but then because of updraft, it comes back up and isrefrozen, and there’s a lot of turbulence.Alie: Oooo! Wow. So it’s a raindrop that almost hits the ground and then it’s like “Nope! I’ll headup to the clouds!”Aside: Hailstorms, I just learned, are different from grapple, which is when supercooledwater forms around a snowflake, and it looks like hail, but it’s not. Kind of like a ball of ice,made up of tiny balls of ice encasing symmetrical ice crystals that formed around a speck ofsomething. It’s just layers and layers of drama.Alie: And at the center of each snowflake is there a speck of dust?Ned: There’s some kind of condensation nuclei. It could be like salt. But yeah, it’s basically dust,for the most part.Alie: And then, let’s get back a little bit to your patrol days, and avalanches. What is causing anavalanche? How much snowpack do you have to have, to cause an avalanche? And what is it,essentially, is it a shelf of snow that just slips off a mountain?11Aside: That was an avalanche of questions, I’m sorry. [cartoon umpire: “Yoooou’re out!”]Ned: The ground is pretty much always right around freezing, so zero Centigrade, 32 Fahrenheit.But the snow surface can really vary, in fact right at the surface is where all the radiativetransfer takes place, so that it can get really cold –Aside: You’re like, quick, let me look at your notes on “radiative transfer”. But I gotta admit,dog, I just copied these off Wikipedia’s test, but okay. Radiative transfer is “the physicalphenomenon of energy transfer in the form of electromagnetic radiation”. So, the surface ofthe snow can melt and then get very cold again? I think that’s what that means.Ned: - that can grow different crystals. That’s where you can get snow that changes once it’s onthe ground and becomes weaker, because of the metamorphic process, and there’s all kindsof different ones. And also new snow is just, it’s much weaker than older snow typically, soif you’re on a steep enough slope, it can avalanche.But there’s a lot to the avalanche. It has to form a slab, which is sort of a cohesive shelf, likeyou were talking about. That is much more dangerous. Then you can also have avalanchesthat are like something you’d see on a sand pile. It’s like a slough. That’s where it’s not sowell stuck together. Snow is inherently like a lot of geologic materials, it’s a layered medium,depending on what happened with the weather, and how it fell, and all that. It has differentlayers and can have different strengths. If you get the correct layering, you get the block, orshelf, that slides downhill. And then the slope angle matters.Alie: So, what causes most avalanches? If not people screaming at them?Ned: Well, new snow. And this goes back to Monty Atwater in the fifties, and his ten contributoryfactors.Aside: Okay, so side note. Montgomery Atwater, of Alta, Colorado, is the granddaddy ofavalanche research. He is the dude. He’s also the first one who thought, “Well, holy hell! Shit,let’s launch small missiles at a mountain to make controlled avalanches happen!”Everyone’s like, “Monty, dope idea.” Now, his was not a work I was familiar with, but amongthe ten contributory factors are things like old snow depth, new snow depth, slope angle,temperature, and Atwater’s work has now become Avalanche 101. Like, the “no doi” of icynar-nars.Ned: We’ve known this for a long time. When you have new snow, especially a lot of new snow, itstresses the snowpack. That’s when you get avalanches. There’s other things; skiers, it’sstress really. Skiers can exert stress through what’s called a stress-ball; they’re affecting theweak layers. But yeah, the avalanche hazard really goes up with a lot of new snow.Alie: Oof. So, tell me a little bit about your work blowing up these shelves of ice.12Ned: When I was a ski patroller, and ski patrollers all across the country, and all across the world,do this every time it snows a significant amount at big ski resorts in the western U.S. and theAlps, they throw explosives at the snowpack to trigger avalanches [high-pitched scream] sothey don’t come down on the guests who are skiing there.It’s very much an old-fashioned cowboy way of controlling the hazard, because you lightthese sticks of dynamite in your hand. Mammoth still uses dynamite, but a lot of places usesome kind of cast primer, anyway, it’s a high explosive, and throw it, and watch it go off, andsee what happens. A lot of time, nothing happens.Alie: Hoo! What does that sound like? The whole shebang?Ned: It’s very loud. You want to watch out and not damage… you try to cover your ears as well asyou can, but of course you need to be able to talk on the radio and stuff like that. It’s hard tokeep your ears plugged all the time.Alie: What does an avalanche sound like itself?Ned: I get that question a lot. Usually they’re silent.Alie: What?!Ned: Yeah. I’ve talked about this with other people, who have seen bigger avalanches than I have,and they say you can hear them when they’re really big. Especially when they’re breakingstuff, you hear the stuff they’re breaking, like trees. There’s a lot of frictional heating andstuff with these massive avalanches. But most avalanches, size scale 1 to 5 for destructivesize, most of the avalanches I’ve seen are destructive size 2 to 3, and pretty silent. [manwhispering: “Silent but deadly.”]Alie: Oh my gosh. Have you ever triggered one that surprised you? That was like, oh that wasbigger than I thought!Ned: Oh yeah. I got caught in a couple of them as a ski patroller. It’s just one of the hazards of thejob. I think a lot of the public don’t know what sort of risks ski patrollers are subjectingthemselves to, to get that mountain open. It can be really dangerous because, for one thing,after you’re done with the explosives, the slopes will be ski-cut –Aside: PS – I did have to look up what “ski-cutting” is. It’s when a ski patroller intentionallyskis across a dangerous pocket to maybe start an avalanche, a.k.a., an actual nightmare.They do actual nightmares. Did I mention they’re not just hanging out in case you need aBandAid?Ned: - to clean up. There’s some places you don’t want to ski-cut, and you won’t ski-cut, butsometimes there’s just little pockets that have to be dealt with. There’s sort of a systematic 13process for doing that. But it means you can be really exposed. That’s how I’ve gotten caughtin the few avalanches that I’ve been in. It’s always been ski-cutting.Alie: Did you dig your way out?Ned: I didn’t get fully buried. Mostly just went for a ride.Alie: [horrified sound]Ned: You know, a couple hundred feet, buried up to my waist, that kind of thing. But I’ve nevergotten hurt in an avalanche.Alie: That was just like a Tuesday at the office for you?Ned: I guess, yeah. It’s a hard thing with the ski-cutting. It’s kind of a controversial practice, but ifyou really think about it, it’s something you can’t get away from as a ski patroller. There arecertain areas you’re always going to have to ski-cut.Alie: Oooh man. What do you do to warm up when you’ve done this? Is there a part of working insnow that involves going to a lodge and drinking cocoa, or is that just a fantasy that I have?Ned: It depends on where you are. When I was ski patrolling, there were ski patrol shacks whereyou “sit bump”, which means you wait for someone to get hurt, and you try to keep one ortwo people up there at all times, because you want to go downhill to get people.When you’re out in the field doing snow research, for instance I’m involved in this NASASnowEx experiment, which is a large field campaign for validating some instruments thatare being flown on planes. If you’re in that wilderness setting, there’s nowhere to go, so youjust try to really bring a lot of warm clothes. Moving around is the best thing you can do ifit’s really cold. But sometimes it just sucks. You’re just really cold, and you bring extragloves, especially when you’re doing a lot of snow-pit work, your gloves get soaking wet. So,you bring multiple pairs of gloves, and switch them. Sometimes it’s just cold and miserable.My hands get cold. I’m not sure they get especially cold, but I definitely have problems withthat. It can be no fun sometimes. You can be freezing cold in some pretty cool places, I guess.Alie: [laughs] I guess that’s a trade-off.Ned: “Cool” is a poor choice of words. [rimshot] There’s a lot of beauty, I guess that makes up forit.Alie: What does the research you’re doing right now focus on?Ned: What I do now, is I do large scale hydrologic remote sensing work, so I’m doing snowpackestimates across large areas, and concentrating in high mountain Asia, particularly in the 14western parts of high mountain Asia, like Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The upper Indus River,which is a huge source of drinking water. Particularly Afghanistan, and the upper Indus,share a lot of climatological similarities with California, in that they have kind of a wetwinter. It’s more continental. Dry summer. It’s not monsoon dominated. It’s mostly waterresources work to estimate snowpack volumes. The snow sort of acts as a reservoir,because it’s frozen up there. If you’re in a place like Afghanistan or in California, itconveniently starts melting in the summer, which is the dry season, and feeds the rivers.Going back to the stuff about the spatial variability in the snowpack, it’s a tough thing tofigure out how much snow is up there, and the two big problems are how much is up there,and how fast is it going to melt? When’s it going to melt? But in a place like Afghanistan,there’s no snowpack measurements, so the rivers will just go dry in September, and it’s ahumanitarian crisis. We can kind of help out with that a little bit with remote sensing, bygiving an idea of what sort of run-off to expect, based on how much snow is up there. Thatcan be really useful for humanitarian aid and lead times.Alie: And, stupid question, favorite or least favorite movie about snow, or ice, or avalanches?Ned: Least favorite? Or favorite?Alie: Whatever you have a reaction to.Ned: I’m trying to remember the name of the movie, but it was really bad. Josh Hartnett was in it,and there was this guy who got lost off the back of Mammoth Mountain.Aside: Okay, I looked into it, and it was Six Degrees: Miracle on the Mountain, about a guywho loses his way. I think meth is involved, and then is like maybe I’ll clear my headshredding on some fresh powder. [clip from Six Degrees: Miracle on the Mountain, withdramatic music in the background: Man, “I just gotta get away.” Woman, “Enjoy the mountainair.” Man, “Always do!”] Any-hoozle. A storm comes, but it’s not just the winter that’s harsh.This movie scored a 22% with critics on Rotten Tomatoes.Ned: I was not a big fan of this film. I don’t think it even made it to the theatres. It’s not wortheven remembering. This happened while I was patrolling, they made a movie out of it. Therewere wolves… and it’s like, yeah, there are no wolves.Alie: [laughing]Ned: I think maybe a better filmmaker could have made the story more convincing. But of course,my all-time favorite movie is Aspen Extreme, which is a ski film from the mid-‘90s [clip fromAspen Extreme: Woman, “There’s always about a hundred guys, maybe two make it ‘tilspring.”]15Aside: Okay, so Aspen Extreme, from 1993, features cool dudes with borderline mullets, andas fate would have it, it too scored a 22% on Rotten Tomatoes.Ned: It was just more formative for me when I saw it, because I was younger.Alie: An inspiring opus, perhaps?Ned: [laughing] Yeah, yeah. Those are the two, just off the top of my head. There have been a lotof terrible ski movies, that people love.Alie: That’s a good point.Ned: I guess that’s one of mine.Alie: Okay, I have questions from listeners.Ned: Oh, okay.Alie: You ready?Ned: Sure.Alie: Here we go. A lot of questions, people are excited about snow. So I’m just going to list theseoff. Several people, Marisa Brewer, May Merril, and Juan Pedro Martinez, wanted to know:What makes the snow white?Ned: That’s a good question. The snow is white in visible wavelengths, because that’s what wesee in. It actually wouldn’t be if we could see into the near-infrared. It actually gets reallydark. Which is one way you can figure out what you’re looking at when you have a satelliteor a spectrometer, something that senses in multiple wavelengths, multi-spectralinstrument. But it’s white just because snow has a very low what’s called a complex index ofrefraction. So, it’s very transparent. What that means actually, is that it tends to scatter lightthat comes into it, instead of absorb it.Alie: Oh!Ned: And absorbing is what makes something dark. The photons are coming in, and they bouncearound in a snowpack, and then come back out. [angels singing] And that’s bright -Alie: Ah! [slowed down: Ooooohhhh!]Ned: It’s all the wavelengths getting scattered back at you.Alie: Ahhh! So, it doesn’t absorb it well.16Ned: That’s right, in the visible wavelengths.Alie: Got it!Ned: Exactly.Alie: Ah! There you go! A ton of people had avalanche questions, obviously, and I will list them allin an aside, because there’s a lot of names.Aside: Okay. They are: Tony Benvenuti, Olaf Doschke, Brook Bissone, Barbara Blackie,Grace Gonzalez, Henry Strong, Wendy Fick, Christopher Enber, Dani Buchheister, GreerNelson, Dustin Parish. Also, please remember, we’re sitting on a bench outside an airport, sodo enjoy the ambient sounds of a few trucks rumbling past. Also his layover was almost up.Oh, and here’s that info about airbags, that I promised you earlier.Alie: Jane Ennis essentially asked: What is the best way to survive an avalanche other than notbeing in one?Ned: I think the avalanche airbags have been a revolution in personal protective equipment iswhat they call it, which for a ski patroller, used to be a CPR mask, and gloves, and nowinclude helmets and avalanche airbags. Interesting story about it, the guy who invented theairbag system, ABS, was a German hunter who had been in a couple avalanches. One time hehad a chamois, which is like a little European deer –Alie: Oh, wow!Ned: - slung around his neck, and he rode to the top of the avalanche and figured, hey thisworked pretty well. He thought it was a surface area thing, that’s not quite right, it’s aneffect called inverse segregation, but it’s the Brazil-nut effect, shake a can of nuts andbasically all the little nuts fill in the holes and make the big nut, the Brazil nut, rise to thetop.Aside: And remember how ice floats in a glass? I also read that icy snow is less dense thanyour watery human body, and so you’ll sink in it fast. So having a large, light airbag, whichkind of looks like a u-shaped pillow you’d use to take a nap on an airplane, but four times asbig, can float you right up to the top of the slide. If you don’t have an airbag, another way tosurvive an avalanche is just to try to move to the side of it, as quickly as possible, and tostruggle to get your head above the snow once the movement is slowing down. So, you wantto get your head up; those first fifteen minutes after an avalanche are critical. Now, anotherstrategy, is just to never go outside, ever again. Ever. Stay warm, watch That ‘70s Show oncable, even if you don’t really like it. Or yeah, airbags.Ned: So, those are, I think, the biggest safety improvement that I’ve seen in my lifetime. I ski withan airbag. It doesn’t add too much weight. It’s like maybe four pounds extra or so in a pack.17Alie: Ah. Did… did you say he had a deer around his neck?Ned: Yeah, a chamois.Alie: Is that a living deer?Ned: A dead one, because he was a hunter.Alie: Oooohhhh! Oh my god. Okay, I was like, you just ski with one of these?Ned: No, you just bring it home.Alie: Got it! Okay, you just walk around with a live, cute deer on your – okay, that makes moresense.Ned: Well they’re littler, too. I don’t know too much about chamois.Alie: [laughing] I’ll look into it.Aside: A chamois is a European goat-antelope. [clip from infomercial: “Sham WOW!”]Alie: Em Mauer and Cynthia Bartz both had igloo questions: How can an igloo keep you warm,when it’s made of tiny frozen water droplets?Ned: Snow is actually a great insulator, because it’s got a lot of air in it. If you think about it, anymaterial that has a lot of air in it, can work as a good insulator. Think of a straw bale orsomething like that. That’s the idea, if you build up blocks like that. And also, they keep outthe wind. It’s actually a pretty good insulate. That’s why snow sticks around for so long.Alie: Oh, because there’s so much air in it?Ned: It’s a good insulator.Alie: I didn’t know that, so if they were blocks of ice, an igloo wouldn’t be as warm? But the snow,because there’s more air in the snow…?Ned: That’s true. Solid blocks of sea ice would not work as well. Although they would still provideshelter from the wind. Which helps a lot.Aside: I just learned that “igloo” in some Inuit languages can mean broadly, a house or ahome, built out of any material, and that the snow house that’s typically called an “igloo”actually has a much more specific name. And yes, linguists have studied a bunch of Arcticregional languages, and yup, there’s a ton of words for different kinds of snow. The Samipeople of northern Scandinavia and Russia? They’ve got a thousand words just for reindeer! 18How boss is that? Also, pardon the planes taking off. Did I mention that we recorded this ona bench outside of LAX? I feel like I did. Okay, let’s talk eating snow, which was asked bypatrons Elisa Norman, Jason Steinhoff, and Em Mauer.Alie: A lot of people had questions about eating snow. Kristen Long in particular asked: As a childI was never sure if it was okay to eat snow – obviously not the yellow kind. Or if it really wasfull of chemicals due to the smog in the atmosphere. Does where you live make a differenceon whether or not it’s okay to eat snow?Ned: Yeah, it does. It’s all that stuff in the atmosphere, condensation nuclei and all that stuff wewere talking about. You can definitely have impurities in the snowpack. And then you alsoget deposition from dust, for instance, on the snow, that’s a big issue in the western U.S.That’s once it’s on the ground. They get these big dust storms in southern Colorado, andmore of these continental areas. You know, we just have the ocean. And most of the dust,like from China, is not making it over here, but they have local sources of dust that they cantrace, and they get these apocalyptic looking dust storms. Especially the older, and longerthe snow has been there, it tends to get stuff on top. Like there’s an algae that grows on thesnow, Chlamydomonas nivalis.Alie: That’s no bueno.Ned: Yeah. I think it’s a fungus – no, it’s an algae I think. Anyway, it makes you sick if you eat toomuch of it.Aside: I looked this up, and it’s called watermelon snow because of this pink blush that thealgal blooms cause. And it even smells like watermelon! But don’t eat it. Now of course, justlike snail m*, it somehow popped up as an ingredient in way-too-expensive face serums.Because, I don’t know, maybe a drop of snow algae juice will make me look younger! Sosomebody loves me! And I don’t die alone, with my mini-Schnauzer left to devour mycorpse. [Far-off echoey voice effect: I think that’s the thinking behind it.]Alie: So maybe don’t. Now, what if you are kind of stranded, like Jason Steinhoff asked: Is it truethat a stranded human cannot eat snow fast enough to stay properly hydrated? And EmMauer asked: Is eating snow actually dehydrating because you spend more energy meltingthe snow than you get from drinking the water?Ned: Yeah, you’re definitely better off melting it, if you have fire, or a stove. That’s prettystandard in most expeditions. Getting it to go through that phase change does require a lotof energy, so it’s not the most efficient way, but you are still getting the water. Yeah, if you’redesperate… it’ll make you really cold!Aside: So, what if you have nothing to melt snow with? Okay, I spent way too long onsurvivalist message boards, and apparently, if you have a canteen, you fill it up with snowand you tuck it between your layers of clothing, and you let your body heat melt it. Just let 19your body do it! Or, you can suck on smaalll amounts of snow at a time, just don’t eat ice likeit’s pudding. Also, one thread said you could pee in a bucket of snow, and just melt it thatway. So you wouldn’t be eating yellow snow. I guess, technically at that point, it would be abeverage. What’s my point? Just bring a canteen. Or, stay inside forever.Alie: A lot of questions about climate change, Madeline Heising wanted to know: I live in Boston,last winter we had a bomb cyclone storm that everyone was freaking out about. And she’sembarrassed to say: I really don’t know what that means. What is a bomb cyclone? And whogets to make up these dramatic names?Ned: Boy, I don’t know. I don’t know what a “bomb cyclone” is. It sounds bad. I think you’d wantto talk to an atmospheric scientist about that one.Alie: Okay, [laughing] I’ll look it up.Ned: Doesn’t sound too good though.Aside: Okay, my friends, I looked this up, and a “bomb cyclone” is also known as explosivecyclogenesis, a weather-bomb, meteorological bomb, explosive development, mid-latitudecyclone, cyclone bomb, or bombagenesis, or snowmageddon. Or, a nor’easter. If you’recounting, linguists, that is 10 English terms for just one kind of storm, and it means thepressure drops a bunch, at least 24 millibars, in a short amount of time (24 hours). It’s whena mass of cold air meets warm air, and the storm gathers intensity really quickly. But it ain’ta blizzard unless the winds are at least 35 mph, visibility is reduced to a quarter mile or less,and this thing lasts at least three hours. And yes, climate change affects the amount of warmair that slams into cold air. Slightly warmer air can also hold more moisture. We may beseeing shorter snow seasons, but heavier snow dumps because of that. So. Climate change.The unnatural Earth puberty that nobody wants.Alie: In terms of fake snow, what are your feelings – Jordan Merrifield wants to know: What areyour feelings on artificial snow made for ski resorts?Ned: You know, I think they really help the ski resorts, the artificial snow helps the ski resortsmaintain a more consistent product, as they’d call it. At Mammoth, they missed theiropening day by one day this year, for the first time since they’d installed snow making, itwas just one day since the early ‘90s. So it doesn’t have to snow at all, they can still haveskiing, and it can supplement. In some places, it’s pretty much all they have, like where Igrew up, in Wintergreen, Virginia. I certainly think it’s okay.One thing that’s come up with the fake snow, is people somehow think that water use is allconsumptive, and it’s just gone. But the truth is, it just runs off when the snow melts, and itgoes right back into the watershed, or down into ground water. Mostly it’s the energy. I’dsay the consumptive part of it, where it uses up the most energy, you have to ionize thesnow. So, big air compressors. It’s a lot of electricity to run the compressor houses.20Aside: I was curious how these work, and I just watched a bunch of videos of huge hosesusing compressed air or fans to blast tiny water droplets high up in the sky, so that theyfreeze, and then flutter down into powder. And apparently this can be an overnight job.Kind of like the snow fairy comes at night in a beanie and a Northface parka, and unleashesits giant hose-arm-octopus-creature to cover the mountain in frozen confetti while yousleep. Cute!Alie: Caroline Lewis and Asriel King both want to know: Are there any ways to better clear snowoff your car, walkway, etc., aside from scraping and shoveling? As a snow expert…Ned: Yeah, I don’t have any good answers.Alie: [laughing]Ned: I don’t like to use the salt, because pets can… and it sort of marks things. I kind of enjoy itthough, it’s kind of a good way to get some exercise when you’re stuck inside.Alie: Right. It’s Crossfit. Winter Crossfit.Ned: Yeahhh…Alie: Kind of?Ned: You gotta watch your back, that’s the main… They even teach in avalanche classes, a thingcalled strategic shoveling, which is more about how to most quickly extract people, it has todo with tiered levels, and stuff like that. You don’t want to just dig straight into the ground.Just like any working at your desk, there are correct ways to sit, correct ways to shovel,correct ways to hold your… so you don’t damage your back while shoveling.Alie: So when you’re digging someone out of an avalanche, it’s almost like terraced levels?Ned: Yeah, this was something that Bruce Edgerly came up with, which is great. The strategicshoveling, for one thing, if they’re on a steep slope, you want to shovel in towards them, notstraight down at them, because it’s the fastest way to shovel out, is to excavate. Also,usually, it depends on what kind of setting you’re in, but especially if you’re at a ski resort,where there are a lot of people, you have more than – chances are you can only have one ortwo people up front doing fast shoveling. Then there’s going to be other people who maybearen’t doing anything, so if they can get behind them on like a terrace, if you can imaginesteps going down, and shovel out that debris from the first group.Alie: Ohhh, right.Ned: That’s the most efficient way to dig.21Aside: Also, if your car is snowed in, I did see some tips like using a lighter to heat your keyif your lock is frozen. Or, putting on a pre-snow car cover, so you can just remove thatsucker, do a little less scraping. Another option is just to never go outside again. Now, mainadvice, lift with your legs, and not your back. And, if you’re my Dad, please wait until I cancome up and help you. Please. Thank you, sir. Also, a lot of you had a similar question, andI’m just going to say your names with my mouth now: Spencer Gillespie, Billy Marino, CarlaHickenlooper, Lauren Harter, Sarah Clark, Barbara Blackie, and Eva.Alie: A lot of people had questions about climate change. Are you seeing your work change a lotin the last ten years?Ned: Yeah, in the last ten years, that’s a particularly interesting period of time. There’s strongevidence that from snow radars, for instance Ben Hatchett is doing some great work, he’s atthe Desert Research Institute at UNR, they’ve got these snow radars that they can look at thesnow levels, and they’ve had a huge increase, statistically significant, over the last ten years.One problem is these snow radars haven’t been around that long, so it’s hard to place that incontext. It could be that this is just a warm ten-year episode, that might not all be due toclimate change, or partly due to climate change. It’s unclear, but anyway, what that hasmeant, even at Mammoth, which has a pretty high elevation. The base is 9,000 feet at mainlodge. There’s tons of mid-winter rain now. Even up higher up on the mountain, which usedto never happen. They’ve had some interesting wet snow avalanches – you get differentkinds of avalanches when the snow’s wet like that, and it’s raining on it. And stuff that a lotof patrollers have never seen before.Alie: Really.Ned: Yeah, it’s definitely warmer, the climate projections are pretty dismal over the next fifty,especially a hundred years. It’s a time to definitely think about, for California especially,think about the way that we depend on snowmelt to give us the stream flow that we needthroughout the summer. It’ll basically mean that the snow starts melting earlier, it’llcoincide with more snowmelt during the wet season.Alie: Oh, got it.Ned: So, more rain on snow, then it’s flooding. A lot of things like that. And just less waterthroughout the summer. And we’ve already seen that with forest fires. Soil moisture is veryimportant to whether or not forest fires occur, and that’s a direct – you know, if you havesnow sitting on top of that soil for longer, and it melts later, there’s more moisture. So weknow that the dwindling snowpacks have a lot of far-reaching effects.Alie: Right.Aside: So, snow hydrology work is not just about skiing and avalanches. We need data thatfolks like Ned are collecting and crunching, to figure out how much water we can expect the 22rest of the year. Another very scientific question; Gillian Leach wants to know: Whatscientifically is the best kind of snow for snowballs?Ned: The warm and dense kind.Aside: Zero hesitation there. Yesss.Ned: Colorado tends to get the lightest snow, sort of at least in the mountain regions in the U.S.,that and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and some of the lake effect areas. But not so muchin the Sierra or the Cascades, or some of these maritime areas, that dense, heavy snow iswhat you want, because it’ll pack better into a snowball. As it gets closer to freezing, it’seasier to make snowballs with.Alie: Do snow hydrologists ever have snowball fights?Ned: Ahhhh… nooo. [sad trombone] When I’m with my kids, yeah.Alie: You don’t get beaned in the face by a colleague?Ned: No…Alie: You’re like, “Mark! What are you doing?!”Ned: No.Alie: Okay.Ned: I think that’s just a… you sort of get used to everything, and get used to being around a lot ofsnow.Alie: That makes sense. Two last questions: what’s the worst thing about your job?Ned: The worst thing is I don’t get outside as much as I would like to. I’m not in the snow as muchas I want to be, because scientific research can be really tough. Writing and being in front ofa computer is not always the easiest thing to do. Anyone who’s being honest would say that.It can be very rewarding in a lot of other ways. I would like to be in the snow more, so tospeak. [R&B track: “Let it snoooowwww…”]Alie: Do you get to ski a lot when you’re up there in Mammoth?Ned: I do, yeah. I get out quite a bit, I do cross-country skiing, skate-skiing, I do a lot of backcountry skiing. It depends on the year. This year looks like a good one so far.Alie: What is your favorite thing about snow or about your job?23Ned: My favorite thing about snow or my job, two sort of different questions I guess, but for me,it’s that I get to work on something that I love, but I love being out there, and the physicalparts of working with snow, and on the snow, and the places that I’ve been to do that. Italso, intellectually, is just a really interesting material. It’s one of the brightest substances onearth. It exists near its melting temperature, it’s extremely weak compared to any othermaterial. I think those are some of the reasons why people find snow fascinating in the firstplace. You peel that onion, it just seems to have more and more layers and interesting thingsabout it.Alie: I wonder, why does snow have a smell?Ned: A smell?Alie: Yeah.Ned: It shouldn’t. [laughs]Alie: Okay. There you go.Ned: Sometimes, like when it’s really quiet, it sounds like it’s quiet in a snowstorm, it’s becausethe snow is acting like a baffle, a sound baffle. So maybe the same thing is going on withsmells. So whatever, if your long underwear smells terrible or whatever, it’s just kind ofcoming back at you when it’s snowing.Alie: [laughing] That’s funny. That was a Patreon question. Thank you so much for doing this!Ned: Sure!Alie: For meeting me essentially in a parking lot at LAX.Ned: Yeah, no problem. [piano music begins playing in the background as voices fade out]Alie: It’s probably one of the weirdest parts of your jobOh heeeyyy, it's that lady in front of you at the grocery store who didn't realize she was holding upthe line 'cause she's reading a magazine, Alie Ward. Okay, this is kind of two episodes of Ologiesbecause over the next two weeks you're gonna get up close and personal with those wizened,slowly ambling boulders: tortoises and turtles and sea turtles. What is their deal? Why do they liveto be one million? Do they need us to save them? Are they misanthropes or just introverts? Etcetera,etcetera…But before we take a deep dive in a turtle burrow - and we will kiddos – per usual, a thanks to allthe friends on Patreon.com/Ologies who help support the making of this show and contribute somany good questions for the ologists. Thanks to everyone who is buying shirts, and totes, and hats,on OlogiesMerch.com. Thanks to all the new subscribers - heyyy!- and folks leaving ratings andeven reviews, which you know I read like your grandma going through old birthday cards. Like thisweek, this one from @putaburkeonit says:This is the type of binge-worthy podcast that makes you sit in your driveway after a 90-milecommute home from work at 4 am just because you HAVE to finish the episode. Not that I'vedone that. Okay yeah, I have.So thank you @putaburkeonit! Thanks to anyone who has ever left a review. If you’ve written one,I’ve read it, and it made me happy, probably.Okay, so turtles. Hooo! Boy howdy are you about to fall the hell in love with turtles. Okay over thenext two weeks, turtles will be digging a gentle burrow in your heart where they will sleep like littlecozy potatoes for the next, I don’t know, 140 years. So this week is testudinology, which comes fromthe Latin ’testudo’ for tortoise. I was introduced to this testudinologist through reptile hero Dr.David Steen, who you may remember from the herpetology episode. Remember him? Right? Dope. Iwas like, "Steen, you got any turtle people?" And he was like, "hot damn, do I." And he introducedme to one of his favorite turtle people on maybe planet Earth.She did her undergrad at the University of North Florida. She had an internship at the JacksonvilleZoo Animal Hospital, and is now getting her master's at Florida Atlantic University studying gophertortoises and what critters share their burrows. And, doing some digging, it turns out that hertortoise love goes wayyyy, wayyyy back. So we talk about: turtles versus tortoises versus terrapins,what's up with those big heavy shells they're toting, and how Team Turtle is affected by humans,her feelings on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, their very crazy… ummm… anatomy, let's say, andhow they live so long and more.Also, I feel I must warn you that these two turtle interviews, this week and next; I'm a little tooexcited about turtles. I was just legitimately, very earnestly pumped. But, pull up a stump and have 2a sit for the infectious dedication of tortoise advocate, wildlife biologist, and testudinologist,Amanda Hipps.----------Alie Ward: Okay, so welcome. Hello!Amanda Hipps: Thank you!Alie: Welcome to L.A.Amanda: I’m excited to be here. [laughs]Alie: Now, where are you from?Amanda: I’m from Florida, from South Florida.Alie: Oh you are?Amanda: From a little fisherman town, Stuart Island.Alie: Did you grow up going to beaches a bunch?Amanda: I did!Alie: Or romping in swamps?Amanda: Both.Alie: Okay.Amanda: I liked the beach. It's fine. But mostly I was in the woods or the swamps, so yeah. Myfamily really loved hiking so that was a lot of what we did, was just hike.Alie: What are the Florida swamps like? Take me to...Amanda: They’re so smelly… [laughs]Alie: Are they?Amanda: It’s so great, I love them! [laughs]Aside: She loves a smelly swamp. How much do you like her already? So much!Alie: I don't think I've ever been in a proper swamp.Amanda: Oh my gosh, you gotta come!Alie: Yeah?3Amanda: Yeah, so just even like hiking in a swamp, it's called slogging, and… [laughs]Alie: I love this.Amanda: I dunno... It's super creepy. You never know what you're gonna bump into. There'salligators, and snakes, and just tons of mosquitos which is maybe the most unpleasantpart of all of it. I don’t know, it's just a very mysterious place and it's very little-hikedthere's, you know, not too many people that you'll run into out there.[clip from “Bird Box”: Sandra Bullock asking, “Is anybody out there? Hello, my name isMallory.”]Alie: How in danger of getting chomped are you?Amanda: You just have to watch where you're going. Just be cautious. I’ve never really bumpedinto an alligator and they're so scared, they usually kinda disappear if they see youcoming. But you have to be careful.Alie: What’s the craziest shit you’ve ever seen in a swamp? I'm sorry, I’m just gonna startanother podcast called Swamp Talk. [laughs]Amanda: No it’s so great. [laughing] Oh my God I love it! I got a really cool picture of acottonmouth when I was in the swamp, and he was just chillin...Alie: And cottonmouths are the ones that, they can bite you bad, right?Amanda: Yeah, they can. They are venomous.Alie: Those are the ones that everyone… They see a dirty hose at a gas station and they'relike, "It's a cottonmouth!”Amanda: Yes, yeah, that's exactly it. [Alie and Amanda laugh]Aside: So side note, if you’ve listened to the Herpetology episode with Dr. DavidSteen, you may remember the hashtag #NotACottonmouth, in which he educates thepublic about the snakes that are frequently, in fact, not cottonmouths. And he sometimeseducates someone so hard that I am in a good mood for days afterward. He just ownsthem.Alie: Do you think that your swamp romping kind of contributed to your wanting to be aherpetologist of some kind?Amanda: Yeah, absolutely. What's crazy is that I’d never considered being a wildlife biologist,actually going to school and doing my undergrad. I was so lost. I knew I wanted to workwith wildlife, but I didn't really have exposure to any of the sciences, and so I kinda justthought, “I wanna work with animals, I should probably go to vet school." And that's 4kind of the guidance I got, I think that's what everyone told me was just, "Go to vetschool." No one really suggested, "Why don’t you go be a wildlife biologist?".Aside: Okay, buckle up for a winding backstory that proves no-one's life is linearand that is beautiful and awesome.Amanda: I did my entire undergrad kinda just gearing it towards going to vet school and that'sreally… I planned my entire life around vet school. I did all of my undergrad courseswith that, and I ended up working for the Jacksonville Zoo as an intern at theJacksonville Zoo Animal Hospital.Alie: Awwww!Amanda: I know, it was so great! It was very cool. It was very hard. In some circumstances it wasdealing with mostly wildlife and native wildlife, and doing rehab and then releasing, soit was pretty cool, but I was dealing a lot with gopher tortoises. Most of them were hit bycars.Alie: Ohhh no!Amanda: Yeah. And so it was really awful. We were really euthanizing a whole bunch. [sadtrombone]Aside: Quick rundown. Gopher tortoise territory is in the eastern, southern UnitedStates, but most remaining gopher tortoises are in fact Floridians. So they're about afoot long, they're between 8 and 12 lbs - the ladies are bigger, hello! And they have thesestrong, scaly legs that are like live garden trowels. And Amanda was also helping rehabinjured tortoises, working sometimes for months with individuals whose shells hadbeen split, until they healed, and then releasing them back into the wild. But that didn’tseem like enough. She was like "Dammit, I love these little mo-fos!"Amanda: I feel like I should try to figure out how to help them in other ways, I would really like toget to know them from the wildlife perspective. I started reading about gopher tortoisesbecause I just was fascinated by them.Alie: What kind of game do these gopher tortoises have? How does a gopher tortoise slowlyburrow its way into your heart?Amanda: [laughs] I don't know, it's so crazy! I think it was more just feeling like there were somany that were coming in. And I... I don't know how they did it. How did they do that?[clip from Lady Gaga’s Why Did You Do That To Me: “Why did you do that do that do thatdo that do that to me?”]Amanda: As far as how they stole my heart I’m really not sure.Alie: Aww!5Amanda: Don’t know how that happened.Alie: So you started reading and reading about them and you're like, “Oh, no! I’ve becomeobsessed with gopher tortoises!”Amanda: [laughing] Yeah, that's exactly what happened. I don't know, I started just looking intothem because I was like, “Ohh!” They're what's called a ’keystone species’ and that'swhere I started learning all about gopher tortoises and I went, "This is a reallyincredible animal!" I was learning about their burrows and how so many other animalswill share their burrows. So they’re really important for the ecosystem.Alie: So they have stowaways?Amanda: Yes!Alie: Is that what a keystone species is?Amanda: Not necessarily. So, the beaver is considered an ecological engineer and a keystonespecies because they’re rearranging the habitat. They're taking these trees, they'rebuilding dams, they're altering hydrology of rivers and that's ultimately affecting thewildlife that's coming. That's affecting the entire ecosystem. Same thing with a gophertortoise. They dig these massive burrows.Alie: Oooh!Amanda: They can be up to 40 feet long.Alie: Their burrows? Or the tortoise? [Alie and Amanda laughing] No, I'm kidding. Just areally stretch limousine tortoise. They’re like, “Damn! No wonder why it’s getting hit,man! This thing's 40 feet long!” Okay, so their burrows can be just like a catacombs?Amanda: Yeah, they dig these massive burrows. They're the size of the tortoise. The shape of it isjust like a tortoise, but they can be up to 40 feet. On average they're like 15 to 20. ButI’ve definitely seen ones that are bigger.Alie: Damn!Aside: So side note: I just went and looked up videos of these turtles with thesebadonka-butts, just flinging sand like little machines behind them, and it's the adorableest. Their burrows are kind of like if you had a tortoise silhouette from behind that wasa cookie cutter that you just bored deep into a hillside like, [slowed speech, like a cutederpy turtle voice] "pa-dew, pa-dew, pa-dew… I live in a tunnel."Amanda: These other animals are using it. There's some species that have just co-evolved withthem and are fully reliant on them.Alie: I want to live in a gopher tortoise burrow.6Amanda: Yes, me too!Alie: That sounds more spacious than my apartment in Los Angeles, to be honest. [laughs]Amanda: It probably is.Alie: Like square footage-wise? Damn!Amanda: But then you’d have all those roommates.Alie: That's true. There’s moles and weevils, you’re like, “ughhh.”Amanda: Everything is just coming in and taking over.Alie: And so you started learning that they're this keystone species because the work thatthey do lets other animals kick it with them. They're the kinda people that buy a bighouse in Tarzana and they're like, "Pool party on Sunday, come over!"Amanda: Literally, that's exactly it. [laughs]Alie: That's what they do!Amanda: They do! [clip from Frozen: Elsa, “This is what a party looks like.”] And it's used for manydifferent reasons. Some animals are coming in to feed. Some of them are coming to... It'sjust a site for reproduction. There's a number of insects, which is actually what I'mstudying, that are living in these burrows and they're fully reliant on the gophertortoise. But they also have this mutualistic relationship where they're feeding on dung,so they're the house keeping service. [laughs]Alie: [laughing] Can you imagine if your maid is like, "I ate your garbage"?Amanda: Yeah! They come in, clean it, they're eating, they're just living their life and rollingaround in shit. They're not just any dung beetle though, they're very specific. Theymight be eating poop, but they're really particular about what they're eating, like whatkind of poop they're eating. And I was like, "This is fascinating." And then justresearching it I found that at my university, University of North Florida, there was anadvisor who was studying them, a professor named Joe Butler. So I contacted him andwas like, "Hey, I heard you're doing some field work with gopher tortoises, can I jump inon this?" [clip from The Hunger Games: Katniss, “I volunteer as tribute!”]Yeah, that's kinda just how I got started. And then that's when I was like, "There's thiswhole field, wildlife biology? Oh my God, what am I doing here??”Aside: So Amanda had been working on projects studying the reproductive successof gopher tortoises and she still had plans to go to vet school. She even applied, and shewas accepted, but she just like, “gehhhh.” She just wasn't really sold on it.7Amanda: I ended up just being like, “I don’t think I wanna go. I don’t really wanna work with justcats and dogs.” I kinda got involved with exotic animals and working with a vet inColorado, and he worked mostly with reptiles. And I just really didn't like it. I was like, "Idon't wanna be in a hospital." I really wanted to be outside.Alie: Oh! That’s such a difference I guess! Having your parking spot, and your coffee mug, andyou know when you're going to sleep, you know what time you're waking up. Somepeople probably couldn’t handle what I am now calling, ‘swamp-romping’ [wet squishingsounds] or you know, burrow-recording or whatever. I guess it really depends on whatkind of lifestyle you want, right?Amanda: Exactly!Alie: How clean you want your fingernails to be.Amanda: Oh my God it's so true! I wanted to be dirty! [Amanda and Alie laugh] It's true, yeah, Ididn't love working inside. I liked working with the animals but I didn't really love thework itself. That's when I was like, "Ok, I don’t want to do this anymore." So I went toMadagascar.Alie: Whoa! That's not Florida! [laughs]Amanda: That's not Florida at all. [laughs]Alie: You're like "Bye, Florida!"Amanda: So I went to Madagascar and kind of got on to this internship where I was studyingreptiles, but mostly snakes. And that was amazing! [heavenly angels singing] It was areally, really, great experience and that's what got me into it. I was like, "This is it. This isthe best that I've felt."Alie: You were like, "ectotherms are my people"?Amanda: Yeah! Yeah.Alie: [record scratch] Are they ectotherms?Amanda: They are.Aside: Oh, man. For a second my brain froze, and I thought I got that wrong and Iwas mortified, but yes, yes, okay. Of course. Turtles are ectotherms. That means theyrely on external sources of heat, which is why you'll see turtles just basking on a log, likepasty Florida spring breakers. And also, why it's so important to dig out burrows, whichare pretty much like walking into an air-conditioned movie theater in July, but darkerand full of dirt and cool bugs that eat your poo.8Alie: When you are starting to get obsessed with turtles, what kind of books are you reading?What kind of chat groups are you in? What kind of group texts? Talk to me about theturtle world.Amanda: Honestly, [laughing] when it comes to connecting with people in the turtle world it'ssocial media.Alie: Really? Turtle Twitter??Amanda: It's Instagram, it's Twitter [laughing]... Turtle Twitter. I mean there are so many turtlegroups on Instagram.Alie: Okay, when you say "turtle groups" are these the sea turtle people, the tortoise people,the turtle people?...Amanda: Yeah, yeah.Alie: Okay. So there's different factions.Amanda: I mean they're all like... I kind of think if you're a turtle person you’re a tortoise personand vice versa.Alie: Alright that is a good segue because we need to get to this right now.Amanda: Okay, ready.Alie: I mean I should have asked this the second you walked in the door. Turtle versustortoise… what's the deal??Amanda: Okay, well, tortoises are turtles. They are turtles, but they are just adapted to living lifeon land. So their limbs are different, their legs are built for walking and digging.Alie: So a sea turtle really should have... Should a sea turtle have a different name like a"surtle?"Amanda: Surtle? I love it!Alie: Like a turtle is just like a whatever, we’re all turtles. And then you're fully sea? You're asurtle. You're fully land? You're a tortoise. You're maybe a little bit of both? You're aturtle, but you're all turtles.Amanda: I think we need to talk about this. [Alie and Amanda laughing] This needs to be... thisneeds to maybe be a change we make.Alie: I mean I just feel like, let's get specific about turtles! Give me some overall anatomicalfacts about turtles, because here's the thing about turtles: We know there's stuff goingon under that shell.9Amanda: Oh yeah!Aside: What is happening under that shell? It's like if there's a silver dome over aplatter of food and it's just a mystery cloaked in fancy armor.Alie: We don't know. What kind of organs? Do they have five hearts? How many butts do theyhave? Y'know, do they even have a liver? What's going on in there?Amanda: Well yeah, that's where it all happens. That's where everything's happening. [laughing]Alie: The party is under the shell!Amanda: So with the shell, the ribs and the spine are, like, built into the shell... into the top of theshell. So it's part of it. The tortoise can't leave its shell, I mean that is everything. A lot ofpeople really do think that they can just walk off and find a new one if they're growing.Alie: Ooooh! Well there's some flimflam we debunked!Amanda: Yeah!Alie: They're stuck with that shell for life. And how is it growing?Amanda: Okay so the shell is bone. It’s bone and it has a cover - keratin - so it’s like our fingernailsor our hair, but it's bone, and so it's growing with the tortoise. And you can age atortoise by looking at the shell, and it's got rings on each of the scutes, so it’s basicallylike trying to age a tree.Alie: Oh my God! So each scute, which is like those parquet floor tiles, kind of gets a new ringevery year?Amanda: Yeah, it's every season.Alie: Is that partly because of conditions, like in a tree, the rings happen when there is a lot ofwater and growth? Is it similar?Amanda: Yeah, exactly. It's sort of seasonal. So it really does depend on location. If you're furthernorth, like the gopher tortoise is further north, they are very seasonal. They do have awinter. They're disappearing into the burrow during the winter, they're not eating formonths and they're just underground, they're just hiding.Alie: Is their heart rate like one beat a year?Amanda: Probably! [laughing]Alie: It's like the lowest metabolism ever!Amanda: Yeah! It's why they live so long.10Aside: P.S. Not only is next week's episode about sea turtles, a.k.a. surtles, but you'llwant to hold onto your butts my friends, because in researching, “How the fuck doturtles get so old??” I came across an ology called biogerontology and the bestbiogerontologist in the world, Dr. Caleb Finch, is based in L.A. Hot damn, yes, werecorded an episode on aging! So stay tuned for that the week after sea turtles. Oooh!Also, the material tortoiseshell, which has been banned in many places, was mostcommonly made from scutes of the hawksbill turtles, which are sea turtles and nottortoises! So not only is it mean, it is factually incorrect a lot of the time. Okay, back totortoise shells, which are the spine and the ribs all fused together into a dome that says,"Don't even try to touch me, you jerks."Alie: And so they have ribs that are fused to the bone of their shell.Amanda: Correct.Alie: And then what kinda guts they got?Amanda: Everything is just under that shell.Alie: Do they have crazy hearts? Is their reproductive system indoor or outdoor? What kindof plumbing is happening?Amanda: For tortoises you can flip them over, and there at the bottom of their belly, the bottompart of their shell, is called a plastron. You look at the plastron, and that's probably thebest way to tell. The male is gonna have a dip, and then the female is gonna be flat. Themale is kind of concave so he can fit on top of the female.Alie: Ohhhhh… got it. Like nesting bowls.Amanda: Exactly.Alie: Um, I shouldn't ask this so early on but I'm just…Amanda: I'm ready for this question, I think I know what's coming.Alie: Do they have crazy dicks, or what?Amanda: Yes! Okay I'm so happy! I’m so happy right now! [Alie and Amanda laugh]Alie: Someone tried to send me a video of a turtle making love to a shoe [high-pitchedsqueaking noises] and I was like, "What?? What is that??" I don't understand what'shappening. What is it?Aside: By the way, those noises were from a turtle making love to a Crocs shoe in aYouTube video entitled, "A Turtle Makes Love to a Crocs Shoe." So cursory searchreturns were almost too copious. Also including other hits such as, "Turtle Makes Loveto a Sneaker”, [turtle lovemaking squeaks] "Turtle Sex with a Shoe”, [different turtle 11lovemaking squeak] and another involving a brief but impassioned romance with aroller blade. Now if you need a visual for this part of turtle anatomy… oh boy. Think ofan artichoke heart, but long-stemmed and stripped of all the leaves, but alive andthrobbing. Um… it's a lot.Amanda: Yeah, I still look at it and I'm like, “What??” [Alie laughs] They're incredible! I mean,okay, let's start from day one. Quite often, when we're doing research with them wehave to mark them, we have to weigh them, and measure them, and so they will exposefor us. I think it might just be displacement. They're just uncomfortable and, "I don'tknow what's going on."Alie: They're like, "I'm uncomfortable, this is awkward, what would help? A boner.” So theydisplay as a greeting.Amanda: Yes, so their dicks are massive. [Alie laughs] They can be. They're huge! And they have tobe big because you know, the shell gets in the way. It's just hard to access the females. Itmakes it hard, so they need to be big. It can be up to half the size of their shell.Alie: Oh my God!!Amanda: It's huge!Alie: What?! Is it all stored inside?Amanda: So what happens is, when it retracts inside the cloaca, it lays on top of itself.Alie: And then they whip it out… and then…Amanda: And then they whip it out. It’s different for different species. With tortoises, it's sostrange, it looks like a flower.Alie: That's what I thought! I was like, "Is that pancake??".Amanda: Yeah, it's very odd.Alie: How does that behoove them? Because that's gotta be more than just distance. Why ahockey puck on a stem? Why a weird inverted mushroom? Like, what is it??Amanda: I'm honestly not sure how that evolved because it's different for different species. Sowith a soft shell turtles, they have five lobes, so theirs is even more crazy looking andI'm not sure why they need that.Aside: Of course I looked this up and yes, it has five lobes with like, let's just say,four nozzles. And the textbook line-drawing I saw looked kind of like an abstract outlineof an orchid, which is fine, but then you imagine it alive, and greenish-purple and youknow what? Actually, let's not do that. Let's get back to the romance of it.12Alie: Do they mate for life? Are they friends for a long time or is it just like, "I'll see you nextseason"?Amanda: I don't think we really know the answer to that. What we do know is that they have…You know, we always think of tortoises as just being solitary animals and not havingfriends, or talking, or hanging out with anybody. That's really not the case. We havefound as far as studies with gopher tortoises go, and I'm sure it applies for other NorthAmerican tortoises, but they have cliques. They have friends. I don’t know if we can callthem friends, but what we have found is that the females will travel to hang out withother females.Alie: Oh, I love this!Amanda: Yeah, me too! But the interesting part is that they're not just hanging out with any otherfemale, they're visiting the same ones. And so they might travel farther to go see afemale that, I don't know, perhaps they connect with them? I'm not really sure what'sgoing on there, but if there's a female directly next door they might not like her. I'm notsure what's going on.Aside: Okay, I'm pretty sure what's going on is these turtles have friends. They'reeither friends, or they're drug dealers poppin’ by the burrows.Alie: And so, same with males?Amanda: No, I don't think that's anything that they saw. Males are visiting females. But if there'sanother male around, they're pretty territorial, so they're probably not really hangingout with other guys.Alie: Who's digging all these burrows?Amanda: Everybody.Alie: Really?Amanda: Yeah, they all have their own. They all have their own and maybe a couple; maybe asummer home and a winter home. They might have more than one.Alie: And they might go in there 10, 12 feet… stay there on their own, and then come outduring the day time mostly?Amanda: Yeah, so they spend probably over 80% of their time underground. They come out tomeet another tortoise that is hanging out. So I'll see the males... They work so hard.They're going from burrow to burrow, female to female, and they will bob their headand try and get her to come out of her burrow. And this happens all day long.Alie: Like horny politicians canvassing.13Amanda: So terrible. Yeah, I feel bad for the females because if they don't want anything to dowith him they can't come out, they're stuck inside. [Alie and Amanda laugh] But at leastthey have a good escape. So even if they're out of their burrow and they're grazing andthey don't want anything to do with the male, they'll just take off and head back to aburrow and knock them off.Alie: Is this all year round or are they seasonally horny?Amanda: Well, I believe that if it wasn't cold it would be all year round. In South Florida, where Iam working right now, they are at least courting all year round. I don't think we reallyknow beyond that, but they are courting. I don't know if they're double nesting, wearen't really sure what's going on there.Aside: So from what I understand, double nesting means having another nest in thesame breeding season. Kind of like when you find out that your grandpa has a secondfamily he hid for decades, except it’s your mom and it's a bunch of siblings. Also, okay,let's get back to the nomenclature because this still feels a little... murky, kind of likeswamp water to me.Alie: Okay, turtle versus tortoise. So turtles are partially aquatic like, they'll go dip into apond for a bit, come back up... What's their deal?Amanda: Well it depends on what we're talking about. If we want to talk about box turtles, theyare mostly land turtles, but they are not a tortoise.Alie: Ohhhh shit man, break this down for me.Amanda: I'm sorry to open this door. [laughs]Alie: Break it down, I don't get it! So what, they're mostly land but they're a little bit aquatic,is that the difference? Or is it just that their legs go out more than they go down?Amanda: They're still near water, they just aren't very good swimmers. So they'll still hang out inwater, in shallow areas, but they're not really swimming very well. Not as if you were tolook at a slider, or a cooter or something like that.Alie: Does that disqualify them from being a tortoise, because sometimes they take a dip?Amanda: I think it really comes down to how closely related they are.Alie: Oh, that makes some sense. There's actual evolutionary lineage. Talk to me a little aboutthe evolution of turtles and tortoises, because I know that a lot of people are hung up.Did they outlast the dinosaurs? When did the planet develop turtles? When did theysplit off into sea turtles and tortoises? Can you walk me through some of that?Amanda: I can try. I don't think we really have solid answers for any of that but the theory, onetheory, is that the link to turtles was a lizard that, I think it’s called the Eunotosaurus. 14It's a stout lizard, short legs, kind of like a tortoise body but without the shell. They wereburrowers and they were, I guess, a little bit slower. From there, there's a turtle thatdidn't have a shell, but it had a plastron. The plastron is the bottom part of the shell, thebelly, but it didn't have a full shell.Alie: The benefit of the shell is protection, mostly.Amanda: Yeah, I'm not sure that's why it evolved. It might have been for digging.Alie: That was my other question! Because if they make the burrow in the shape ofthemselves, is it kind of like a cool borer into a mountain, or is it more like, [higherpitched small animal voice] "Hey, I'm withdrawing, please do not bother me."Amanda: We don't know. It could have been that it was for burrowing, for digging, and then it sortof just ended up being a form of protection.Aside: So up until a few years ago, we thought turtles went back about 220 millionyears, until a paper came out in 2016 about this 260 million-year-old lizard in SouthAfrica that developed a shell, scientists believe, just for the purpose of burrowing. Theprotection? Just a bonus. Kind of like a shovel but you're like, "Oh hey look at that! Icould also use it as a shield." P.S. The person who discovered the proto-turtle fossil wasthen, 8-year-old Kobus Snyman. And also, just to hammer this home, turtles includetortoises and sea turtles and terrapins, which are smallish turtles that live in fresh orbrackish water. Although, in the UK, turtles mean water pals, tortoises mean landfriends, so it's kind of regional.Alie: Where do turtles and tortoises sleep at night?Amanda: Well, it depends on the species. Tortoises, like gopher tortoises, are native to the coastalplains of the United States, so they are using burrows. They're gonna be underground.The other North American species like the desert tortoise out here, they are hiding out.Some of them do have short burrows, and some of them are hanging out under rocks orthings like that.Alie: Why are they so goddamned cute?Amanda: [whispers] I know!Alie: What is it about a turtle, like who doesn't trust a turtle? Do you know what I mean?Okay I will amend that, because I have seen a picture of an alligator turtle and I was like,“Oh my God!”Amanda: Oh my god I love them though!Alie: This thing has a hellmouth. What’s happening with it?Amanda: It is terrifying!15Aside: Okay, the alligator turtle is not a tortoise, but it is a nightmare. Imagine astout turtle - the largest ever recorded is said to have tipped the scales at over 400 lbs. -and it has three ridges along its back, like giant punk rock studs. And then its mouth…hooo its mouth, y'all! Okay, a spiky beak that could crush bones! And a little wormy,doohickey, dingle-dangle on its tongue that lures a live fish into its mouth! These thingslook like if the biggest dude on the football team had anger issues and also a falconbeak… and was made out of wet kelp.Alie: Have you ever seen... Do they have them in Florida?Amanda: Yeah.Alie: Really?Amanda: But they're very northern Florida.Alie: Okay, I did a little bit of research on them for the food anthropology episode, we talkedabout turtle soup. And they talked about obtaining… And so I looked it up and was like,"Oh my God, what is that? That looks like God's dingleberry. Get it out of here. What isit? What is it?!" But other turtles are so adorable.Amanda: They are.Alie: Now how big can turtles get?Amanda: Well, if we're talking about tortoises, there's the Galapagos tortoise, which is the largest.Alie: Oh, is it the largest?Amanda: I think so.Alie: I believe you!Amanda: It's the Galapagos, and the Aldabra, and then the African Sulcata, so like the three largestthat are extant that are living today.Aside: While surtles can reach 2000 lbs., the biggest tortoise ever recorded, itseems, was a fellow named Goliath, who weighed over 900 lbs. but passed away in 2002.Also dead, Lonesome George, a Pinta Island Galapagos turtle who was the last of hisspecies, and the longtime ‘George Clooney’ of tortoises - eligible but single. LonesomeGeorge, despite trying, sadly never produced any offspring. Passed away in 2012 ofnatural causes. He was found by his keeper of over 40 years, Fausto Llerena Sanchez,who is a park ranger, who retired not long after George's death, and he said, "I feel likeI've lost a best friend. There's a void and there's a sorrow, especially when I see thephotos. In my heart I'm not convinced he's dead." But he’s dead. I mean he wastaxidermied and put in a museum, so he’s pretty dead.16Now alive, and perhaps the oldest living land animal, is a tortoise named Jonathan, whohas double cataracts but a pretty good sense of hearing at 187 years old. 187 years old!Yes. You heard that right.Alie: Do turtles have ears? What's the deal?Amanda: Oh, wow. So they... I wouldn't call them ears. What is the term for it… They are called...Alie: Nubbins. [Alie and Amanda laugh] I'm feeling that's incorrect.Amanda: Can we call it that?Alie: Yeah, we'll call them nubbins.Amanda: Okay! They’re hearing mostly through vibration, it’s internal. Yeah, you're not seeing anear.Alie: If you were to whisper to a turtle how much you liked it, do you think it could hear you?Amanda: I don't know.Aside: Okay, I looked it up and they are not, sadly, called nubbins, but rathertympanums, which is a disc membrane at the back of the face. Now, could a turtle hearyou if you whispered how much you love it? I looked into it, and... probably. In onepaper that lamented the lack of auditory knowledge of turtles, I did find that what isknown is that turtles have a higher hearing threshold than other reptiles with bestfrequencies heard around 500Hz. Now, according to Sataloff's Comprehensive Textbookof Otolaryngology, it is noticed that a noise band for whispers begins at 500Hz. So yes!Whisper your love at your tortoises, if you have tortoises.Amanda: I know that with my tortoise he…Alie: Wait a second!Amanda: Oh gosh...Alie: You have a tortoise?? Oh my God!Aside: Wait what? This was a huge revelation!Alie: So you're a tortoise owner!Amanda: I am.Alie: You're a tortoise lord!Amanda: I am.Alie: That's exciting! Who is he? Is he a boy or a girl?17Amanda: Oh my goodness. He's a boy. His name is Banshee.Alie: His name is Banshee?Amanda: Yeah, I named him when I was seven.Alie: Oh my gosh! He's so old! Well, you're so young. How did you obtain him?Amanda: Oh my gosh, it's a terrible story, and I don't encourage it. This is why I don't really talkabout him. Actually, it's a good...Alie: Is it a cautionary tale?Amanda: Yeah.Alie: Did you buy him on the black market?Amanda: No. I did get him from a pet store.Alie: It happens!Amanda: Yeah! So I was a little girl, like seven, I don't really remember. I was probably around 10.And I was like, "Dad, I really want a tortoise." I begged my father for a tortoise. [laughs]Alie: Oh yay!Amanda: He was on board with it because it seemed like an easy animal to take care of, no bigdeal. So we went to the pet store and I picked out a tortoise. It was relatively large… Imean I don't wanna say large. He was probably three years old and five inches across,which is pretty small.Alie: So he was already… He wasn't like a tiny, quarter-sized tortoise. He was already doinghis thing. He probably had a routine, a personality, he had a thing. And so you took himhome and you're like, "I'm a tortoise owner."Amanda: I was like, "Hey, ma, look what I got!"Alie: And?Amanda: Oh my God, she freaked! She was like, "What is that?" And she got on the computer andstarted looking up African Sulcata Tortoise, and she freaked out on my dad.Alie: So these get large?Amanda: They get huge! Huge. And they live forever. So she's doing her research and she freakedout on my dad. She was like, "What are we doing? We just adopted this thing that isgonna outlive our daughter!" And so we did it! They did it! They wanted to keep him. Weall fell in love with him, and he's definitely been a part of the family for much of my life.18Alie: How big is he?Amanda: He is probably about 125 lbs. right now.Alie: Wait a second!Amanda: I feel like he's still growing. I don't know, but I really hope he is not. He’s huge!Alie: Wait! How big is that? Is that the size of a coffee table? Half the size of a coffee table?Amanda: Yeah, I mean…Aside: She looked down at my coffee table, a wooden slab that is 51 inches long. Imeasured it later.Amanda: Okay I'm looking at your coffee table. I'm thinking three quarters...Alie: Oh my God, that's a huge...Amanda: No, maybe half. Maybe a little more than half.Alie: We're talking the size of maybe a cafe table.Amanda: Yeah.Alie: He's a huge tortoise!Amanda: He's pretty big.Alie: Where does he live?Amanda: In my backyard. [laughs]Alie: What does he eat?Amanda: He lives with my parents still. He eats hay and grass. He grazes. Yeah, it's not an easy petthough. He has a pretty good space, but he needs a lot of space. And then we have toconsider, you know, a burrow, and enrichment, and how to keep him happy and healthy,and it's a lot of work.Alie: How have things changed when it comes to turtle ownership in the last couple decades,do you think?Amanda: Oh my gosh. There is definitely more information. When we first got him there wasn't awhole lot. It was like, "You're fine feeding him fruit and vegetables from your fridge."And it's not. It's not okay. So there's a lot more information for sure. And I do think thatpeople are understanding as far as enrichment and how to take care of them, but there'sstill a lot that is unanswered and we're still figuring out a lot.19Alie: So do you think that having Banshee... Do you think that he informed your interest inturtles? Or do you think he predated it because you already wanted a tortoise?Amanda: I don't know. I'm not really sure why I wanted him. I don't know why I was so intrigued.It made me feel like I needed to get more involved. He's my pet and I kind of feel badowning him, because I look at him, and now that I'm working with wildlife I'm like,"Man, this is what you're missing out on!" It's sort of difficult to think about him notbeing able to live that kind of life, like a lot of wild tortoises.Alie: You mean like getting it on?Amanda: Yeah! I mean it just happens all day long.Alie: Right.Amanda: It does!Alie: Maybe it's something like being homeschooled. There are benefits. You don't have todeal with bullies, you don't have to deal with anyone throwing a milk carton at you, butyou also miss out on some weird shit.Amanda: That's true. Yeah. I do think that they can live a good life in captivity, although I don'tthink it's ideal, necessarily. I do think there are good owners, and people love theirtortoises and their turtles, but it's hard! I think before you go trying to get a tortoise anddeciding to adopt one, there's a couple things you need to look at. You need to makesure you have a back-up plan; who's going to take care of this animal when you're gone?Alie: Oh my God! Isn't it crazy that when you write a will, and you're probably too young tohave done so, you have to include something about Banshee?Amanda: I do! Yeah, it's terrifying! Because I'm like, "I don't know, I don't even have kids; where'sthis tortoise gonna go?" It's very scary. And even now, he's still with my parents. I don'thave a house. I don't know what's gonna happen, and so that's where, before you get ananimal like this, you really have to know where you are. Are you settled down? And thenwhat's gonna happen when you're gone?Alie: So Google it! Get into it!Amanda: And also know where it's coming from, because the pet trade can be pretty hard onwildlife. It's not good for wildlife, so definitely know where the animal is coming from.Alie: Right. You hear those stories about dudes that get through TSA with parakeets in theirpants.Amanda: Gosh, it's so terrible!Alie: I know, but it's also like, man, there's gotta be a better way to make a living.20Amanda: No kidding!Alie: Than putting snakes in your pants? [Man speaking in a croaking voice: “I’m a snaaake!”]Alie: When it comes to age and turtles and tortoises, because obviously Banshee is going tolive to be 1 million years old, why do they live so long? I mean I saw this thing onlineabout a turtle - she was 140 years old - and her newborn baby turtle. I was like, "theyjust keep going." Can you imagine being 140 years old and being like, "Here's my infantson?"Amanda: Oh my gosh!Alie: What's happening with them?Amanda: They have a really slow metabolism. If you think about a hummingbird that's going1,000 miles a minute, I don't really know how fast they go, but a hummingbird probablyisn't going to last more than a couple of years.Alie: Same with little mices.Amanda: Exactly. They have a really high metabolism.Alie: I think that the president of the United States uses this argument to avoid exercise,because he thinks you only have a certain number of heartbeats per lifetime.Amanda: Yeah, no. That’s not okay. Continue doing your exercise. [laughs]Alie: He thinks you have a finite number and that's why he's not super active. I'm gonna factcheck this, just so that nobody just thinks that I'm shit-talking. This is just gonna bebolstered with fact.Aside: [unknown voice reading from The New Yorker: “Other than golf, heconsiders exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finiteamount of energy.”]Okay, alright, so… moving on.Alie: Why are they so damn slow?Amanda: Their shell.The shell just doesn't give them... It's heavy, it's in the way. I really don'tthink they'd be so slow if they didn't have the shell. There are tortoises that… They'reslow, but they can be fast when they want to.Alie: They can book it?Amanda: They can book it, yeah. I posted a video of a gopher tortoise on Twitter. This was, I don'tknow, probably a year ago. She saw me on a trail and she got freaked out, but herburrow was actually closer to me, so she booked it towards me. Everybody was 21intrigued, they were like, "I had no idea a tortoise could run like that!" [cartoon runningfast dashing sound]Alie: And then what's the biggest myth about turtles that you're just ‘over’?Amanda: Oh my gosh, just the old man. Maybe the old man... [laughs]Alie: That they look like grandpas?Amanda: Yeah!Alie: Do they have different personalities? Turtle to turtle?Amanda: They do, they really do. Oh my gosh. Even in the field with wild animals, when I get towork out in the field sites with them, I feel like I can definitely identify some of themthat I see, that I come across frequently, just based on their personality. Let me tell youabout this girl, she's my favorite tortoise. Her name is Grumpy Gertrude. [comical sadtrumpet waah-waahh followed by audience laughter]Alie: Oh my God, I love her already!Amanda: My advisor was the one who introduced me to her. When I would enter the field site -her burrow was right at the entrance - and so when you would come in, she woulddefend her territory. So anybody that came in, she would come out bobbing her head,which is a sign of defense, and just try to shoo us away. She is just very territorial andvery aggressive. I have a video of her attacking my camera.But then there's other moments, too, where she is very tolerant. I was at a differentburrow and was working with another tortoise, and she saw me so she came out of herburrow. She just wanted to check stuff out! She wasn't defensive because it wasn't herterritory. So she came out and she walked all over my gear. She's very curious, she's alsovery defensive.Then there are others that are really shy. You'll handle them or take them out andthey're not... they will not come out of their shell. So yeah, there's definitely personality.Alie: And can they... they can get all the way in them? So that they're just like, "I'm a rockbitch!"Amanda: Yeah, yeah.Alie: But some, like sea turtles, can't do that?Amanda: Correct.Alie: But all other turtles and tortoises can be completely like, "Closed. Gone Fishin'.”22Aside: So she says that soft-shell turtles - which are not tortoises or surtles, but areaquatic turtles who look kind of like a rubbery pancake made out of mud - they'll alsoflippity-flop about without tucking in their legs. Now, getting back to tortoises though.Alie: What does your field work usually involve? Can you take me through a quick day in thelife of Amanda Hipps?Amanda: Oh my gosh, I love my field work! It's hot and muggy, it’s South Florida scrub habitat, sothere’s no shade. It depends on what I'm doing. If I'm looking for insects, I am surveyingburrows. I usually go in with a camera scope and I can get a view of what's inside theburrow. I can measure it in that sense too. Sometimes I see stuff with a camera.Sometimes I'll see snakes, sometimes I'll see frogs. It's really cool.From there, I’ll try to look for insects. I take a big, two-meter scoop and scoop out sandand sift through it, catch flies that are flying around. At night I'll go out with a black lightand ‘black light’ the burrows to look for the specific burrow moths that live in there.They also eat shit, which is really cool.Alie: Yes! But you're trying to figure out, okay, with the gopher tortoises, who is eating theirshit? We have to find out how many species would be affected if these gopher tortoiseswere wiped. Right?Amanda: Exactly.Alie: And why are they getting so wiped? Cars?Amanda: Cars... habitat loss.Alie: We're making too many malls?Amanda: Yeah, they're just... they're being pushed out. It's really sad to see, especially in southFlorida where there's really high pressure to develop, and so they're just constantlybeing relocated, the tortoises. They're getting relocated, but a lot of the other animalsare getting left behind.Alie: Oh no! Ugh. So that research is important to protect them. What kind of measures arebeing taken right now to protect gopher tortoises?Amanda: Well it's no longer… In the past you could basically just build on top of them. You cancover the burrows.Alie: No!Amanda: Yeah.Alie: Like a mausoleum?Amanda: Yeah.23Alie: That's so awful! How long would they be living under there?Amanda: Probably months.Alie: That's horrible!Amanda: Because they can deal with very little oxygen.Alie: Oh, no!Amanda: Yeah, they would just be underground. And that’s terrible.Alie: So we're not doing that anymore?Amanda: We're not doing that anymore. You do have to get a permit if you wanna build andthere's tortoises on the land, so now they get relocated. There's a lot that goes into it,though. They have to get relocated, but you can't just dump them at another site.They're so specific to the area. Imagine being 60 years old and living in the same areaand then getting relocated. If they’re just put somewhere else, they're gonna continuelooking for their home.Alie: Oh, no!Amanda: Yeah, so you really can't just take them somewhere else. There has to be what's called a‘soft release’. They set up pens and they have to basically keep them in these pens forone or two years, and they have to get acquainted to their new home.Alie: And then kind of give up and be like, "Oh, I guess I live here now."Amanda: "I guess this is it." Yeah. Eventually they can be taken out and they are able to go out intothe tortoise population.Alie: So it's a process, it's not just like, "See ya."Amanda: Yeah.Alie: Ugh. Are there any movies about turtles or tortoises that you love or hate?Amanda: You know, Ninja Turtles [Alie laughs] is probably the only one that comes to mind.Alie: Their burrows are sewers.Amanda: Yeah. [laughs]Alie: I didn't realize how accurate that was!Amanda: So true!Alie: Because those really are long tunnels!24Amanda: They are!Alie: Who knew that was factual? The pizza's factual, right?Amanda: Definitely.Alie: Yeah, okay. The back flips: factual. Okay, Patreon questions. You ready for somelightning round?Amanda: I am ready for this.Alie: People love turtles, dude.Amanda: I'm excited!Alie: People! Love! Turtles! [little boy saying, “I like turtles!”]Aside: Before we get to the Patreon questions, however, a quick break to tell youabout a sponsor of the show who makes it possible for us to churn these out every week.And also a word about this week’s charity, who is getting a donation from the Ologiescommunity. Amanda chose the nonprofit AlongsideWildlifeFoundation.org, which is a501(c)(3) nonprofit supported by a grassroots network of people just passionate aboutwildlife conservation. They do research and outreach, they promote science-basedsolutions for living alongside wildlife in perpetuity. They even raise money to givegrants to scientists who can continue doing important work with wildlife. So, they rock.Thanks for picking them.Alright, back to the show. Let’s have those Patreon questions!Amanda: Please tell me we've got a penis question. I know we already talked about it, but...Alie: Oh, of course we did. Liam Chavez wants to know: Straight up, how did you get your job?I'm obsessed with turtles and tortoises, and I would love to do something with themeither professionally or volunteering.How can you get up in that turtle world?Amanda: Okay, well, it's hard to say. I don't even know how I got this one.Alie: You're like, "How did I get here? I love it!"Amanda: I know, it sorta just happened again. How to get involved: you can look for whatever isin your area, figure out what species are around you, and see if you can volunteer. Ifyou're out west, like here, there's the Desert Tortoise Council, and the Gopher TortoiseCouncil in the East.Alie: You gotta network, turtle people! There's Turtle Twitter, there's hashtags.25Amanda: Oh my gosh!Alie: Make turtle friends!Amanda: It's so true. I think that is really how, ultimately, I ended up where I am. It's justconnections and meeting people with similar interests.Alie: Make turtle friends! There's turtle clubs. Are you kidding?Amanda: For sure!Alie: Every city has a turtle and tortoise club.Amanda: I should join one! Why am I not in a tortoise club? [laughs]Alie: I don't know. You gotta hang with those nerds! I looked up the local turtle and tortoiseclub when I was looking for a good cheloniologist.Amanda: Oh my gosh!Alie: Turtle people are out there, they're just in a burrow, in a shell. You just gotta get toknow ‘em.Amanda: You just gotta find us!Aside: Side note Liam Chavez, I found your address through Patreon, and I lookedup what's close to you. I found the Bay Area Amphibian and Reptile Society, which ishaving a meeting on January 25th. So for more info, you can see BAARS.org. Everyoneelse, Google your city, plus "herpetological society." See what comes up! Make someturtle buds. Maybe wear an Ologies shirt there and find your people!Alie: Lacie J Scheuer wants to know: Do turtles that hatch from the same nest hang out witheach other for a while? And if so, how old are they when they go off on their own? Likedo they hang for a while, do they learn behavior from other turtles or is it just like, "I'mout"?Amanda: They're out.Alie: Oooh!Amanda: When I was monitoring nests in North Florida, they would hatch out of their shell, andyou would let them go, and they would just start digging a burrow.Alie: Oh!Amanda: Yeah, or eating. The second they come out, they're off and they're just living their life.They're not hanging out with mom, they're not hanging out with each other, they'reeating and they're trying to find a place to hide.26Alie: God, if only all babies were like that.Amanda: I know, right, then I would have kids!Alie: I know! Just poop out a dozen of them and you're like, "good luck!"Amanda: “Alright, see ya!"Alie: "Don't eat each other!" Jonathan C. asks: Have turtles been on earth longer thanhumans?That answer is…Amanda: Hell yeah!Alie: Hell yeah! [laughs]Amanda: They've been around for much longer.Aside: Okay, so turtles - proto-turtles - evolved 260 million years ago, and humans,scientists say, between 300,000 and 195,000 years ago. It's being debated. Regardless,turtles win, and we suck.Alie: Austin H. wants to know: How long does the average turtle live, and what are the mostcommon causes of morbidity?Amanda: Oh. Tortoises will, on average, live probably about 80 to 150 years, depending on thespecies.Alie: [whispers]Damn!Amanda: Gopher tortoises kind of average at 60 but the one... the oldest one that we know of, is incaptivity and he's like 96. We don't really know how old gopher tortoises truly get, butprobably between 60 and 150. The second question was…?Alie: They die of what, boredom? What are they dying of? I mean, cars?Amanda: Yeah, mostly cars. Cars are a really big problem for all turtles and tortoises, so...Alie: What do you do when you see a turtle in the road? Have you risked life and limb to get aturtle out of the road?Amanda: No, I don't ever recommend risking your life, but you can help them cross. Just makesure it's safe for you to do so. I do help them cross all the time but…Alie: You do??Amanda: I would not lunge in front of a car, to be honest. I do like my life. It’s so common inFlorida to see them crossing all year round. I will help them cross. It’s always a good 27idea to help them cross in the same direction that they’re going, because they’re verystubborn creatures and they know where they wanna go, so don’t try to convince themotherwise! Don’t try and convince them to go somewhere else, just move them in thedirection that they’re going. But it’s pretty easy to move most turtles and tortoises. Youcan just kind of grab them by the sides and help them cross. Snapping turtles are a littledifferent. You have to be a little careful.Alie: Right. Why are snapping turtles such dicks?Amanda: They're just… yeah, they're just angry.Alie: Like, maybe something in their disposition just evolved to be like, "Listen, I'm realbitchy, I'm real defensive, Those of us with these beaks..."Amanda: “I can use it!”Alie: “Yeah, I'm gonna use it.”Amanda: Yeah, I would if I had that. [laughs]Alie: [laughing]I probably would too. No one fucks with someone with a beak like that.Amanda: So true!Alie: So you can move them, but cars are a big one.Amanda: Yes, yeah.Alie: Okay, alright. So Morgan Sweet wants to know: Other than limit the use of off-roadvehicles, what are some of the ways that we can help with tortoise conservation whilestill enjoying our public lands?Amanda: Well, a lot of it is supporting the legislature. And voting.Alie: Kelli Brockington notes that Cuff and Link from Rocky, which is now a Creed franchise,are, she thinks, Red Stripe Racers. How long can these guys live? Because apparently thesame turtles that were in the original Rocky in '77, were in Creed in 2017!Amanda: What??Alie: I don’t know. There were two turtles that were in Rocky...Amanda: Oh, I think she's maybe thinking Red Ear Sliders.Alie: Oh, Red Ear Sliders. Oh, Red Stripe Racers, that's so close! I thought that was a differentspecies! So yeah, these same turtles were in two franchises. I guess they can live for awhile.Amanda: They're famous. Yeah, they're very old.28Alie: I wonder if they're the most famous turtles.Amanda: I don't know. That's a really... I would love to know.Alie: Yeah. Well, I'll look into it.Amanda: Okay.[Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa in Rocky: “These are the exotic animals I was tellingyou about. These are my friends Cuff and Link.”]Aside: So these turtles, terrapins if you will, I know are alive and 44 years old. Theyappear to be aging very nicely. Or they've just had impeccable work done.Alie: JCW. says: Why are there two distinct lineages of turtles; the snake necks and the nonsnake neck turtles?Amanda: Oh, I think he's thinking the side-necks. So there's two lineages. There's the cryptodira,which is the hidden-necks. Those are the turtles and tortoises that can pull their neckinside of their shell. Then there's the side-necks, and that's pleurodira. [automatedcomputer voice: “pleurodira”] They can just, instead of pulling their neck inside, they'rethe side-necks so they just turn their neck to the side.Alie: Oh! So they just put it under a shelf?Amanda: Yes, that's exactly it.Alie: Okay, I didn't know that! They tuck?Amanda: Yeah, they tuck.Alie: Interesting.Amanda: As far as like, evolving, I'm not sure why.Aside: Side-neck side note: So I looked into this, and apparently there's still a lot ofmystery about the side-neck turtles, but some research came out just this past summerthat may link the drift of continents to their distribution and evolution, and may haveled to sea turtles. I mean: flipper feet, we got shovel hands, retractable heads, crazydongs... Turtles, man, living the life.Alie: Rae Casha says: I've seen a lot of videos when someone thinks they're helping a turtle bytossing it in the water, when it's actually a tortoise!Amanda: Oh my gosh Alie, this happens all the time.Alie: Oh, no! What's an easy way to tell the difference and should we just leave them alone?They probably know what they're doing unless it's crossing the street. In that case, I'll 29definitely help a brother out. Rae Casha, okay, this is a depressing question but weshould answer it.Amanda: Yeah, this is a question we should talk about. It's a good question. So this happens withgopher tortoises all the time…Alie: Oh my god!Amanda: And I can probably imagine tortoises here, desert tortoises. Yeah, people confuse them.Gopher tortoises sometimes will live on the beach. They live in the dunes, they haveburrows there and so sometimes they'll be taking a walk down the beach and peopleconfuse them for sea turtles. They'll think that it needs saving, and they'll put it in theocean. And this happens very frequently, so now a lot of beaches will have signs thatsay, "Please don't touch the tortoises." Like, just let them be.Alie: Oh, no!Amanda: First of all, we shouldn't be touching them, period, unless they need help crossing aroad. They don't really need help. Turtles, especially if it's a sea turtle, you shouldprobably be calling somebody. You shouldn't be touching it. If you see something thatneeds help, I would call FWC or your local DNR or something.Alie: [in sad voice] Got it.Aside: P.S. that's the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or theDepartment of Natural Resources. Now, if you're staring down the barrel of a turtle, howdo you tell if it's a surtle or a tortoise?Amanda: If you're looking at the limbs, that’s probably the best way to tell. Tortoises have thesestout, muscular limbs. They don't have webbed feet, so they're kind of just more builtfor digging. Turtles… you'll see their limbs have webbed feet and they can swim.Alie: So one's stumpy, one's webby.Amanda: Yeah.Alie: So little elephant legs vs. kind of webby... webby, duck-leg limbs.Amanda: Yeah, exactly. [laughs]Alie: I am a scientist! [laughs] Let's see, Raquel Nuno wanted to know: Can they come out oftheir shell?Amanda: See, yeah, these questions are so common! That's okay! No, they can’t. Everything is inthat shell, they're attached to their shell. The spine is attached to the shell, their ribs areattached to the shell.30Aside: So that question was from planetary scientist and selenologist, Raquel Nuno,who taught us all about the moon. And this is another wonderful reminder that even thesmartest scientists keep asking questions! And Amanda says she gets that question somuch because of cartoons. And I just did a Google image search of a "cartoon turtleleaving shell." So many little nude turtles! But the reality of a turtle leaving its shellwould be like us just taking out our spines and hanging them up on a coat rack at theend of the day. It's Nightmare Town.Alie: Jen Wu says: From my husband, who loves turtles, which turtle is the best?Amanda: Ooooh. Hmm…Alie: This is gonna be controversial.Amanda: Yeah, this is a question I don't even want to get involved in. [laughs]Alie: Enemies will be made; alliances will be forged.Amanda: They will! Oh my gosh. The truth is I really don't have a favorite. [“sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shsure”] I feel like my favorite is the last one that I've seen. I feel like every time I see oneI’m just like, "you're my favorite!" And then I'll see the next one.Alie: Grumpy Gertrude!Amanda: Grumpy Gertrude is definitely, without a doubt, my number one. Yeah.Alie: Okay. I love that right now, somewhere across the country, there is a tortoise namedGertrude who is beloved.Sarah Crocker wants to know: Sexually mature at what age?Amanda: Ooh! This is a good question! So this also depends on species and location. In SouthFlorida, gopher tortoises will mature as soon as seven, because they're not having tohibernate. They're not having to stow away for the winter, so they're eating all yearround. They're growing a lot faster, so they're maturing by age seven. In the northernpart of the range, like Alabama, they can take 20 years to reach sexual maturity.Alie: [whispering] Oh my God!Amanda: So a lot of it is just dependent on location.Alie: God, that's like sharks. So much puberty.Amanda: Yes, yeah.Alie: For decades! Just a slight, slight, hairy mustache and bad skin and uncontrollableboners. For decades. Them and sharks, they're like, "this sucks, man!"31Chris Brewer wants to know: Would you consider the tortoise to be the introvert of theanimal kingdom?Amanda: I don't think so.Alie: Really?Amanda: I mean, maybe, but working with gopher tortoises, I really thought differently about it. Iknow they have these really high social structures and I don't know if I believe thatanymore.Alie: Okay! I think that's smart. I think that's good to know. They're like, "No, I just don't wantto talk to you, maybe. I'll talk to other turtles, though."Jennifer Buz asks: Can they really breathe out of their butts? If so, please give all thedetails.Amanda: Oh, wow. This is not something that is usually brought up with tortoises, but yeah, someaquatic turtles can have oxygen exchange through their butts...Alie: Ahhh!Amanda: If we wanna call that breathing, yeah I guess that's the case, but it's not happening likebreathing through your mouth. It's just an oxygen exchange through tissues.Alie: Does that help them if they're diving or if they're in the mud or something?Amanda: Yeah.Alie: Okay! Stick your butt up. Okay.Amanda: It's not a snorkel. It's not a snorkel. [Amanda and Alie laugh]Alie: A butt snorkel! [bubbling water sounds, then a splat]Rich Gross says: A long time ago I was at a fair where they had a giant turtle and allowedpeople to ride it. How much were they hurting the turtle?Amanda: Aw. Yeah, it's not good.Alie: Okay. [cartoon umpire saying, "Youuuuu're out!]Teagan Wall... I saved the Patreon question that was perhaps the most important forlast. Dr. Teagan Wall says: I've had my turtle, Yurtle, for almost 25 years. Does she loveme? Can she love me?Amanda: Yurtle!Alie: I know.32Amanda: One hundred percent!Alie: Oooh, that's amazing! [DJ airhorn]Amanda: Okay so the... Is that the whole question?Alie: That's the whole question.Amanda: Oh my gosh I love it! Teagan... I would like to believe that my tortoise loves me. I don'tknow that he does. I know that he loves to eat, so when I come out with food he lovesme.Alie: I think they love you. I mean, if they can have buddies…?Amanda: I do, and I think that my tortoise recognizes individuals. He knows me and he knows mymom because we're the ones that feed him, and so he does come to us. He's not gonnabe quite as active or wanting to go towards a stranger.Alie: Yeah, they know who you are! Of course!Amanda: Yeah, I think he definitely recognizes us.Alie: Okay, shoot. One more Patreon question. E. Brown wants to know: How does theirlongevity impact their perception of time? And is that why they seem so chill all thetime?Amanda: I don't know. That's something that we've never looked at but is a very interestingquestion.Alie: I don't know. If I knew that I didn't have to hurry up so much, and that I could havechildren at 150 years old…Amanda: This would be so good for me!Alie: Oh God!Amanda: I'm such a late bloomer that… [Amanda and Alie laugh]Alie: You could take your time on everything! You kidding?Amanda: I would. I mean, I have. [Amanda and Alie laugh]Alie: You're doing stuff! You're getting degrees! You're saving gopher tortoises!Amanda: Yeah, I'm just doing it a little bit later. But I'm happy with it, I’m happy.Alie: It seems like you've fallen into exactly where you want to be.Amanda: Yes, I have never been happier with my career choice.33Aside: She loves turtles so much, she can't even bear to shit-talk them. This! This istestudinological loyalty.Alie: What is the worst thing about your job though, or about turtles? Do you have any shityou wanna talk about turtles?Amanda: No! We can't go there Alie. [Amanda and Alie laugh]Alie: What about your job?Amanda: As far as my job, I think we're in a time right now where there is so much urbandevelopment and habitat loss, it's really hard to see all the habitat loss. There's been acouple of times where we've found tortoises at our field sites that have been hit by cars.So I think those are probably my worst days.Alie: God, I bet. Ugh. Do you have burials for them? That's a stupid question, but I'm asking itanyway. What do you do when you see a dead tortoise?Amanda: I actually collect them. What I'm doing right now is looking for what's called a gophertortoise shell moth. These moths will feed specifically on dead gopher tortoise shells.Alie: Oh my God!Amanda: Yeah.Alie: Find your niche!Amanda: Exactly!Alie: Bloom where you're planted, man.Amanda: Basically, I take the carcass and put the shell out into my field site, and kind of just sitand wait for moths to appear, but it hasn't happened yet.Alie: Do tortoises mourn other tortoises? Do they have big brains... tiny brains?Amanda: They're pretty small. They have very small brains. I don't know. There hasn't beenanything recorded where tortoises are mourning, so I'm not really sure. But I dowonder, it does make me wonder because they have these structures, these socialstructures. So I wonder, "Who is missing you? Who's trying to go to your burrow nowwhen you're not coming back?"Alie: I know! I wonder if they ever try to scoot them into their burrow like a mausoleum.Amanda: I don't know.Alie: You know what I mean? Ugh, final resting spot. Turtle death! Who knew?! I'm gutted!What is your favorite thing about turtles or your job?34Amanda: My favorite thing about my job is the people that I’ve met. Even just being on socialmedia and just kind of connecting with people that have similar interests, even if they'renot in the same field, has been so much fun. I think that's definitely my favorite part.Alie: Turtle Twitter.Amanda: Yeah, Turtle Twitter.Alie: Get into it!Amanda: Yes!Alie: I feel like if turtles give you butterflies, you gotta get up and find your people. You gottafind your turtle people.Amanda: Yeah! I mean, it took me so long to get to this point to really be like, "Oh, wow, this iswhere I'm supposed to be."Alie: But it's about turtles, so it's supposed to take you forever!Amanda: Exactly.Alie: You're not studying hares. You know what I mean?Amanda: That's so true.Alie: Do you hate The Tortoise and the Hare? Are you like, "lay off the turtles" even though thetortoise ends up being the protagonist?Amanda: The tortoise wins. Yeah, I really don't hate it, it's fine. It's just a fable. I did get a videoonce, it was on a camera trap, of a cottontail rabbit that was living with a tortoise in aburrow. I have so many videos of him just chilling and hanging out. There was onewhere he came over and the bunny kind of got up into the tortoise’s face just to sniff it.It was so cute.Alie: Aw! Where they friends?Amanda: I don't think the tortoise gave two shits about the rabbit.Alie: How long did they kick it together?Amanda: He was hanging out for probably like two or three weeks in that burrow.Alie: Oh my God! Has that gone viral on The Dodo yet or something?Amanda: It hasn't!Alie: Jeez Louise!35Amanda: I should post it. I think I posted it on Instagram.Alie: It's like the best rap beef buried ever… actually burrowed. [Alie and Amanda laugh]Aside: I very highly recommend following Amanda on Instagram and/or Twitter.You've got videos of tortoises, field work videos, and also follow her hashtag #shitbugsfor updates on the dung-gobbling burrow mates she's studying, as well as videos aboutGrumpy Gertrude, tortoises and hares just kicking it...Alie: Where can people find you?Amanda: I'm on Instagram as @BioPhiliAmanda and Twitter.Alie: Nice. Consistent handles?Amanda: YesAlie: Dope, man. Makes things so easy!Amanda: It does, it does.Alie: Try to get the same handles man, ‘whoof’. You gotta get in early, even if you gotta put anunderscore.Amanda: Oh my God, I changed mine so many times too, but I am set. This is it. [laughs]Alie: Well thank you for all of the work you do protecting the turtles.Amanda: Oh, gosh, I love it! Thank you for having meAlie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. I have been promising you forweeks an episode about aging and marching toward our demise, molecule by molecule. Here we are,folks! We made it! This is an interview that is like concentrated laundry detergent. It’s like eatingspoonfuls of instant coffee like cereal. It’s to the point. It’s intensely powerful information; minimalbuffoonery. Aging: Why? How? Let’s get into it.First, let’s get some business out of the way. I want to thank everyone supporting onPatreon.com/Ologies for submitting their questions, making the show possible. Anyone wearingOlogies merch out and about, I hope you find each other and fall in love. Have me officiate yourwedding. Thank you to all the folks who have rated, and subscribed, and left reviews. I read themall. You know that.For example, GlassFullOfSass, who said they, “changed two passwords and signed into fourdifferent accounts to leave a review,” which was very hilarious and sweet. Also, thank you for thereview CateVF, who says:Every week I wait with bated breath for the latest episode to drop. Alie and her guests are socaptivating. And one episode even brought attention to a medical condition I didn’t realize Ihad! And may have saved my life. Thanks, ol’ Dad Ward!Thank you for continuing to live!Let’s talk about old age. Okay, biogerontology etymology. Bio means ‘life’ and geron means ‘oldman’. So, the biology of an old guy. Not super inclusive in terms of its roots, but it’s a subset ofgerontology. It examines the processes of aging. How does ‘olding’ happen? Now, I came across thisology after recording Cheloniology about turtle lifespans back in November and a Wikipedia pagewhispered, [whispering] “Biogerontology is a thiiiing,” which ushered me to an article about howone particular ologist has been studying this since the 1950s, and lo and behold, his office was a fewmiles away from me in LA. What?!So, I gingerly begged him via email to hang out and I freaked out when I got a reply. Then, Inavigated to USC with my vintage purse full of microphones and hope, and I knocked on his door 12seconds after our appointed time. [door creaking]There he stood, a person who is ranked in the top half-percent of the most-cited scientists in theworld; 500 papers with his name on them! Decades of research, thousands of students, scores ofstudies. This dude in the cardigan and the khaki pants, standing before me with a long white beardand office piled with books, he is the dude! Now, for a visual, just Google Image search, “FatherTime,” and then add a laser-focused expression and a furrowed brow.He’s like a human fountain of knowledge on how our youth slips away. In the Death and Dyingepisode, I talked to Cole Imperi, who makes ballpoint pens inscribed with the motto: I don’t havetime for bullshit. I should have given this biogerontologist one of these pens as a parting giftbecause as you will hear: when you are an expert on mortality factors, you don’t suffer fools. Youdon’t waste any time. This man does not have time for bullshit, and I love him.Let’s get right into it. Let’s talk about metabolisms, modern lifespans, risk factors for losing yourmemory, thoughts on a possible cause and cure for Alzheimer’s, why we age, secrets of 2centenarians, and what a 78-year-old professor and globally-lauded science hero does to stay so fitand so sharp. So sit up straight, take some notes for the concentrated crash course on the forwardmarch of molecules with world-renowned biogerontologist, Dr. Caleb “Tuck” Finch.----------Dr. Caleb Finch: Remind me of where the radio program is?Alie Ward: It’s on Apple’s iTunes and anywhere on the internet. Thank you so much fordoing this. Let’s go into your background a little bit. Can you tell me why youdecided to study aging?Dr. Finch: Well, as an undergraduate, I was looking to work on fields that had not been fullydeveloped in which there would be the chance to work out some of the basic questions.One of my professors at Yale, who was a physicist named Carl Woese, was coming intobiology in 1958. He said, “Well, why don’t you think about aging? Nobody knowsanything about the biology of aging, even much less than how embryos develop.”And this was 1958, which was just five years after Watson and Crick and we didn’t knowwhat the genetic code was. So that stuck in my mind. Then when I got to graduate schoolin New York at Rockefeller University, I did my PhD on aging and sort of the first paperson the neurobiology of aging came out of my work there.Aside: So yes, Dr. Caleb Finch attended Yale on a scholarship, working in labs to helppay his tuition and he graduated in 1961 with a degree in biophysics. Then he went onto Rockefeller University to get his PhD in cell biology, studying cellular activities duringaging in mammals. He gave a talk on this subject and afterward some jabroni came up tohim to say, “Don’t bother, everyone already knows what they need to know aboutaging.”That tall drink of Haterade was pathologist Peyton Rous, who had recently won a Nobelprize. Finch was like, “Whatever dude,” and went on to become one of the foremostvoices in the highly respected field of senescence research, which is a fancy word thatmeans the condition or process of deterioration with age.Alie: So what part about the aging process fascinates you the most? Is it the effectneurologically or is it the entire body?Dr. Finch: It’s the unknowns that we are still working out, the basic mechanisms. We know that itis under some genetic influence. If you have the genes of a mouse you’re only going tolive two years. If you have the genes of a human, you might get to 70, 80, or 90. So, it isgenetic, but then among individuals, the role of genetics seems to be much less. Identicaltwins’ lifespans, you can attribute… 20% of their heritability in aging is due to genesthat influence aging. It’s really a minority of the individual differences in humans and inother animals that can be attributed to inherited genes.Aside: Only 20% is attributed to genes, which is terrible news for those of us who liketo deny personal responsibility.Dr. Finch: I’ve been working, in many parts of my career, on environmental aspects of howindividual gene responses to the environment, to diet, influence outcomes of aging. I’mnow, in the last six or seven years, been focusing on air pollution, which shortenslifespan in proportion to the number of particles per cubic meter and also acceleratesalmost all of the diseases of aging, including the risk of Alzheimer’s.3Alie: Was that inspired at all by living in Los Angeles?Dr. Finch: Indirectly because I have had colleagues in the epidemiology group on the HealthScience Campus who were pointing out to me that the rate of arterial aging in LosAngeles scaled in proportion to the density of air particles in your residence. Thearteries that they were studying were the carotids, which go to the brain. They keptsaying to me, “Well, Finch, you’re interested in the neurobiology of aging, you reallygotta see if there’s a relationship to the arterial aging that we’ve described as driven byair pollution.”So, that’s what I undertook to study, and last year we published a definitive paper incollaboration with an epidemiologist, J.C. Chen, at USC’s School of Medicine. In that samepaper, a mouse model showed that air pollution increases the Alzheimer’s processes;and we know what molecules are involved in the mouse anyway.Alie: Let’s go to the super basics. As someone who is not as well versed in this as you, whatexactly is aging? How do you define aging?Dr. Finch: Well, the basic way is at a population level, that after the age of 40 your risk of mortalityessentially doubles every seven or eight years.Alie: Oy!Dr. Finch: There’s an exponential increase in mortality risk and preceding that is a parallel risk inchronic diseases: heart disease, cancer, and at later ages, Alzheimer’s. The individualpathways in this are not understood, but by age group, aging increases the risk ofchronic diseases that are causes of death. Then you can ask at a more fundamental level,“What are the mechanisms behind that?” That’s where the mystery is.Aside: So, our risks of disease and dying go exponentially up. Rather than bum you out,let that fact encourage you to write the novel you’ve been intending to, or call in sickand go to Six Flags tomorrow. Wear the shoes you think you should save for fancyoccasions. Wear ‘em today! We’re all getting old. Just go for it, champ! Speaking of, howdo you ask a genius expert the most basic bitch question ever? You just do it, people.You live in the now. Watch.Alie: Is it that our cells don’t regenerate as fast?Dr. Finch: That’s part of it. Our molecules don’t regenerate as fast and there’s some molecules thatare as old as we are in our blood vessels, and our connective tissue, and in our eyes thatundergo molecular deterioration.Alie: I know they say you’re kind of a new person every seven years, is that–Dr. Finch: That’s not at all correct.Alie: Okay. [laughs nervously] So that’s some flimflam to debunk for sure.Dr. Finch: It’s just not true. That’s one of those inherited tales that has no scientific substance. Ihave no idea where that comes from.Alie: I gotta look it up.Dr. Finch: Yeah, there’s no science there.Alie: Right. I didn’t think so. I don’t know where that came from, but it’s an interesting myth.Dr. Finch: No, it’s not interesting. It’s destructive because it’s wrong.4Alie: Right.Aside: By the way, if you’re like, “Was Alie just dying at this point?” The answer is,“Yes.” [with crickets in background: “Man, I am dying up here…”] Both from a molecularstandpoint and psychologically. But stick around, because like life, there are twists andthere are turns around every corner.PS: Where did that destructive myth start? I did a little digging, thinking the originwould be an ancient tale, but it seems like it started in 2005 with a Swedish stem cellscientist, Jonas , who had been curious about the ages of different cells in the body andused radioactive carbon-14 tracers, conveniently deposited in humans from nuclearwarhead tests in the ‘60s, to track the age of different cells.So how old are you, really? Okay, there’s a cool math trick you can do. You take your age,and multiply it by 16, then divide it by 16. Which is your age. You’re just your age. Imade you do math for nothing. Here’s the deal; your body is a bunch of different ages.The lining of your guts, which are constantly splish-splashing in an acid bath, they’renewborns. They turn over every five days or so. But your skeletal muscles are 15.They’re about to get their learning permits. Some parts of your brain are just as old asyou are, just about. Other parts turn over faster. The core of your eye lens (see theOphthalmology episode for more on that) is exactly your age from pre-birth. That neverturns over.This is fun. This is like Antiques Roadshow for your meat-covered bone scaffolds. [clipfrom Antiques Roadshow, Ted: “Nobody’s ever looked at it that I’m aware of.” John Buxton:“Well, Ted, did you notice when you showed this to me that I kinda stopped breathing alittle bit? Not only that, but the condition of this is unbelievable.”]In his 900-page book, Longevity, Senescence and the Genome, Caleb Finch covers thelifespans and aging processes of everything from apple trees, to 40-year-old clams, tolobsters who molt away their exoskeleton and avoid some mechanical aging that way, tosturgeon fish that can outlive humans, to relatively old teenaged salamanders. If youlistened to the Cheloniology episode you might remember my aside about the Etruscanshrew that has a heart rate of 1,500 beats per minute and lives two years versustortoises with slow metabolisms, like ol’ Jonathan, a giant tortoise kickin’ it retirementstyle on an island at age 187.Naked mole-rats can live up to 32 years, perhaps due to an uncanny ability to just slowdown their metabolism when they need to, or repair their wonky DNA, which humanscan also do. I don’t think Dr. Finch would enjoy the term ‘wonky’, but here we are.Alie: Now, how do different animals age? I know you mentioned a mouse might have alifespan of two years.Dr. Finch: Each species has its own pattern of aging. Mice don’t get Alzheimer’s disease and theydon’t get blood vessel disease and have heart attacks, but they do get cancer. Theirarteries become more rigid and their lungs become more rigid because of molecularaging. That part of aging happens in humans at a much slower rate. In addition, we havediseases that are special to the human species, including Alzheimer’s disease.Alie: You’ve said that other primates don’t get Alzheimer’s the way that humans do?Dr. Finch: They have a very much milder aspect of brain aging. There’s nothing equivalent in thegreat apes or in the Rhesus monkey to the devastation in the brain of Alzheimer’s 5disease where there’s huge amounts of death of neurons in particular pathways. There’smajor gaps that still remain to be filled before we have a definitive conclusion. At thepresent time, I’m comfortable in saying there’s nothing that has yet been shown to beequivalent to the level of brain cell damage that happens in Alzheimer’s in any otherprimate.Alie: And what is causing that? I know there’s many, many factors, but primarily–Dr. Finch: Well, that’s a huge set of unknown questions that the field of Alzheimer’s is – and I’m inthat field in a significant way – is trying to understand. There are changes in the brainthat are going on from the age of 30 onwards. In my lab in the 1970s, I had the firstevidence that there’s a progressive loss of synapses in the brains of healthy mice andhealthy humans in middle age.So there’s changes that are happening in the 30s to 40s that are a pathway that, in someindividuals, takes a more steep dip leading to a degeneration of neurons. We don’t knowwhat triggers that steep dip from a more gradual progressive change that everybodyexperiences.Aside: Sidenote: just about a week or so ago, a study was published that had theinternet all abuzz. It had the catchy title: “Porphyromonas gingivalis in Alzheimer’sdisease brains: Evidence for disease causation and treatment with small-moleculeinhibitors.” [“Wow!”] In short, researchers found that a bacteria that cause gingivitis, akainflamed gums, could lead to brain inflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s. This seems likehuge news! But of course, I’m primed for flimflam debunkery.Also, I saw there was a study from 2005 by Dr. Margaret Gatz about gum disease andAlzheimer’s, so maybe this isn’t new news. Maybe this is just internet sensationalism. SoI emailed Dr. Finch, expecting either crickets or a “Pshaw!” But I got a note right back. Hesaid, “Just looked this up. As a mouse study, it is impressive and supports Margie Gatz’sprior conclusion that oral infection increases Alzheimer’s Disease risk, but now gives amechanism.” Exciting! He was on board. This was great.Even more exciting, he had cc’d Dr. Gatz who said, “Thanks all!” back. Had a little fangirlmoment. So yeah, a tiny bacteria in your gums can make big brain trouble later on, andthis news is getting us closer to keeping healthier noggins in the future.Alie: Is the brain the part of our body that ages the quickest, or where do we see aginghappen?Dr. Finch: Well, I’d say blood vessels are... In terms of shared anatomy across men and women, theblood vessels are already beginning to age even before puberty.Alie: Really?! So we’re already…Dr. Finch: Yes. We’re already accumulating fat and plaques on our arteries. If you’re in a householdwith smokers as a child, it’s accelerated. If you’re in an area of high air pollution, that’saccelerated, as a child.Alie: Wow.Dr. Finch: Then there are differences between men and women by reproductive status. Theovaries of women start to lose egg cells even before birth.Alie: Oh, wow.6Aside: So yeah, you start dying before you’re born, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Just cut bangs,text your crush, we’re all gonna die.Dr. Finch: So by the time of puberty, half of the egg cells a woman was born with havedisappeared, and then the rest of them are lost by age 50, which is menopause. Thereisn’t anything equivalent to that in men. The testosterone levels do decline. Fertilitydoes decline, but it doesn’t have a steep drop off as is the case from women. This is animportant example of how our embryonic development defines different patterns ofaging because the ovary is fully formed in the embryo, and those genes turn off and nonew egg cells and follicles are formed after birth. There’s nothing like that that happensin the male gonad. [“Testes, one, two, testes, check check.”]Aside: I just want to acknowledge that the terms men and women, and male andfemale, are along a gender binary that doesn’t apply to everyone. Dr. Finch is talkingabout broad strokes in historical studies. I just want to let the nonbinary folks know outthere that I see you, and I love you.Alie: What about male versus female lifespans? Have we seen that change over the last fewdecades, or is it pretty steady?Dr. Finch: Well, no. They both increased as overall health has increased and it is observed in thehealth-rich populations of the world – and our upper-income people in this country area health-rich people – that women are living five years longer than men.Alie: Why is that?Dr. Finch: We don’t know!Alie: I’m trying to think if it’s stress or not, but I feel like–Dr. Finch: No, it’s not simple like that. It’s hard to define stress because a completely stress-freelife is impossible. On the other hand, there are people who have apparent high levels ofstress; women who have eight kids and who will live to be 90. So it’s not at all clear howwe define stress.Aside: Sidenote: quick shout out to my grandma Teresa Ward, who lived to be 99 yearsand nine months despite having [echo effect] 11 children. [DJ airhorn]Alie: So what are we doing that is helping progress aging? What are we doing wrong,essentially, when it comes to aging?Dr. Finch: Well, the major health concern across the country is people are eating more energy-richfoods than they need and not getting enough exercise. That simple lifestyle take-homeis, it’s boring to say, but if you are even mildly obese in midlife and you’re not exercising,you’re having a shorter life expectancy.Aside: As the fit Dr. Tuck Finch explained this, I wondered if he had a turning point inhis life and started to pay more attention to his health. Such as I was doing, sitting in hisoffice at that moment.Alie: Has your work changed the way that you live?Dr. Finch: I would say no. I’ve always been athletic and physically active and I never smoked. Idon’t eat or drink sugary or fatty foods. That’s always been my preferred avoidance. So,nothing interesting to say.Alie: Well, do you play basketball? Do you ski? What’s your secret?7Dr. Finch: I used to be a competitive swimmer. I swam in college. I get modest amounts of exercise,not too much to wear my joints out. I do some hiking. I do some swimming. I do someweightlifting. I mean, nothing exotic or overly strenuous.Alie: No Zumba or Tae Bo? No kickboxing?Dr. Finch: No, no. No.Alie: Okay, good. That means I don’t have to start that.Dr. Finch: It’s very dull. Nothing unusual.Alie: You mentioned something about sugar, and I know that inflammatory foods andinflammation is part of your research. How does inflammation affect the human body, interms of aging?Dr. Finch: Well, all of the diseases of aging that we worry about – blood vessel disease, obesity,Alzheimer’s disease, cancer – involve the molecules of inflammatory responses. It’sdeeply built into our systems and in the processes of aging. That’s just a fundamentalfact.The term inflammation comes from an ancient understanding of when you have a cut, itswells up, and it’s red, and it’s hot, and it causes pain. Well, the basis for that are theinflammatory cytokines that come in to help the body clean up the damaged tissue. Butresponses to damaged tissue happen, inflammatory responses, in arterial disease,cancer, obesity, and in Alzheimer’s disease. So there’s a shared core of inflammatoryproteins that are at work during aging from the day we’re born. [clip from Clue, Mrs.White: “Flames! On the side of my face! Breathing, breaths, heaving breaths!”]Alie: Is there a way that we should be keeping inflammation at bay?Dr. Finch: Well, that’s part of the idea of exercise and diet, which reduces the level of inflammation.Some people are still looking for pills that will do the equivalent of exercise and properdiet, but that’s the strongest starting place.Aside: Soooo, move your bod and eat your greens. We fixed it, America! [choir singing:“Glory, glory, hallelujah!”]Alie: Where has the average American lifespan gone? I mean, are we still increasing or havewe hit a point–Dr. Finch: No, we’re decreasing. In the last 10 years, the average lifespan in the United States hasdecreased and we’re now 20th or 30th in the world in our adult lifespans, because of allthat we’ve been talking about and the epidemic of obesity has a direct relationship tothat. Plus the health disadvantages of lower-income people who don’t see doctors andcan’t afford medication. And then this terrible epidemic of drugs. Those are all pushinglifespan down after remarkable gains in the 20th century.Alie: What’s happening in other parts of the world, in blue zones where longevity is higher?Aside: Sidenote, what is a blue zone? This came up in the Hematology episode and Ionly know that because I searched my Google Drive for the word legumes.A blue zone is a place identified by author Dan Buettner who has studied somescientists’ data and concluded that people in five places live the longest: Okinawa, Japan;Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Icaria, Greece; and a small posse of Seventh-dayAdventists in the LA suburb of Loma Linda, California.8What, sayeth Dan, are commonalities among these groups? Apparently, they areprioritizing family above everything else, they smoke less, they eat a lot of veggies, aresemi-vegetarian. They have constant moderate physical activity, and good socialengagement. Which does not mean likes and comments on Instagram but hanging outwith many generations in the community. Also, legumes. They eat a lot of legumes. DoesDr. Finch think this is just a hill of beans?Dr. Finch: Well, I’m not enthusiastic of something unique about the blue zones. There are peopleson all the continents who live a little longer than the average, but most of my colleaguesdon’t think there’s anything unusual about that. But if you look globally, lifespan hasbeen increasing as early life mortality decreased because of reducing infectious disease.Pushing against that is the global epidemic of obesity, the global sale of tobacco, which ishuge in Africa and Asia, and the global issues of air pollution which is getting worse inmost of the world because of fossil fuel consumption and global warming.Alie: Is global warming and temperature change contributing directly to the way our bodieswork or age?Dr. Finch: That story is emerging. This is a book that I wrote that talks about this. This came outthis year.Aside: This book is called The Role of Global Air Pollution in Aging and Disease. The titleappears in stark white ALL CAPS against the veiled, smoky silhouette of a pollutedParisian skyline. I am truly confounded as to how one human can be so prolific.Alie: I did wonder… I mean, you’ve published over 500 papers and four books.Dr. Finch: Actually, this is my sixth book.Alie: Your sixth book! How do you approach life? How do you get all of this done? How doyou balance all of this personally?Dr. Finch: I have a very happy home life. I work very hard, but I give myself personal time andavoid feeling ground down.Alie: Oh, that’s very smart. That’s a very good life lesson.Dr. Finch: Well, what works for me might not work for other people.Aside: Don’t mind me. I’m just having a moment here... evaluating everything I’ve donewrong in my life. [clip from The Police song, I’ll be watching you: “Every breath youtake...”]Alie: What do you think… As the baby boomer generation starts to age, what do you think thebest thing our society can do to–Dr. Finch: ‘Our society’ doesn’t have much meaning. There is no such thing as our society, right? Imean, who is our society? There’s hundreds of societies, so every community has itsown lifestyle. The main point is a healthy diet, and exercise, and avoid cigarettes. That’stotally boring to say, but that’s really the basis for optimizing outcomes of health at laterages. You need to maintain a healthy lifestyle from childhood onwards.Aside: So now is the time when we dive into listener questions, and also I mention thata portion of the podcast income goes to a charity each week. This week Dr. Caleb Finchchose CureALZ.org, a non-profit organization dedicated to funding research with thehighest probability of preventing, slowing, or reversing Alzheimer’s disease. To date,they have raised over $86 million to fund almost 400 studies, and 100% of funds go 9directly to research. So thank you listeners for helping a lab buy some pipettes, gettingcloser to a cure for Alzheimer’s.Okay, your listener questions. Now, I didn’t want to take up too much of the professor’stime so I blazed through these questions without reading off a bunch of names, but I willinsert them when I can. For example, the first two questions here were asked by LizSundin, Athena Balistreri, Dionne Dabelow, Mike Monikowski, Anonymous Bob, AnnaThompson, Lucille Audinet, and Taylor Munich.Alie: I have some listener questions. Almost everyone is just asking: What’s the secret toaging well? It seems like diet, exercise, rest.Dr. Finch: Yeah.Alie: Yeah. Do you think that there’s a maximum age that the human body can reach?Dr. Finch: Well, the evidence is very clear. Almost nobody gets beyond 100. There’s one person inthe last 30 years who reached over 120, Jeanne Calment. There are more people gettingto 100, but they still, in the last 30 years, she’s the only one to get beyond 120.Aside: Sidenote: Jeanne Calment lived to be 122, the oldest human on record, and shewas fond of wearing headphones, and doing chair gymnastics, prayer, fruit salad, andsmoking. [record scratch]Well, one Dunhill cigarette a day and a small glass of port wine until she was 117, whichproves that you’re never too old to quit a bad habit and turn over a new leaf. Seriously,let’s Nope the Smokes, Folks. Love, ol’ Dad.Alie: Do you think that there’s anything to the secrets that they claim ‘a glass of whiskey aday’? A hard-boiled egg? Staying single?Dr. Finch: Who says this?Alie: I think every time someone reaches a remarkable age.Dr. Finch: I have never heard that said. People say that about them, but I have never any of themsay that. You have to distinguish between what people say about centenarians and whatthe centenarians actually said. If you talk to Nir Barzilai in New York at the AlbertEinstein Medical College, he’s a great expert on this. What he’s shown is that his group ofcentenarians have the same diseases as other people. Some of them smoked and someof them are still working. There isn’t really any genetics or lifestyle that makes itobvious as to how they got there.Aside: Super quick: this lab at Albert Einstein Medical College is great and focuses onthe metabolic decline of aging. They hypothesize that the brain leads this decline. But,just real quick, let’s get back to if I was hallucinating stories about eggs and whiskey.Good news! My brain still works because the internet is just littered with stories ofcentenarians with quippy secrets to longevity that are just bogglingly bad advice. One ofthe oldest living WWII vets, Richard Overton – who passed away in December – he livedto be 112 and he drank four times as much coffee as me. [Richard Overton: “I get me acup of coffee. I drink four cups of coffee in the morning. This morning I drank about thatmuch whiskey.”]And four cups of whiskey a day! So, okay, he is going to be the only one. Right? Mmm?Nope. Nope. Mariano “Pops” Rotelli said at 107 that everyone should have a littlewhiskey nip a day, telling a newspaper, “I’ve had a shot of whiskey in my coffee every 10morning for 100 years.” He continued, “I went to the doctor three times in 100 years.He’s dead. I’m still living.”Okay, so that’s two people. Wait. Wait. A 105-year-old British man, Jack Reynolds,credits his long life to a daily regimen of whiskey. Agnes Fenton, 111, told reporters thatshe drank three Miller High Lifes and a glass of Johnnie Walker daily. Also at 111, GraceJones credited a shot of scotch every single day for the past 58 years, which I don’t thinkis how you are supposed to drink scotch, but you live that long, you do what you want!Did I make up the egg part? I did not! Italian, Emma Morano, lived to 117. She consumedeggs every day; also a glass of brandy daily. But put the bottle down, friends. Thecurrent oldest person alive, 116-year-old Kane Tanaka, of Japan credits family, sleepand hope as her secrets for longevity. She also drinks a lot. Of water. She eats a lot ofsmall fish and soup and she keeps faith in religious spirits. What I’m saying is, it’sanyone’s guess. And by anyone, I mean Caleb Finch; and by guess, I mean conclusionsbased on decades of research.Alie: And you mentioned that genetics is only about 20% of a factor.Dr. Finch: 20-25%, somewhere in that.Alie: So it’s a minority. What’s the role of telomeres in aging?Dr. Finch: We don’t know. So telomeres are the ends of chromosomes that get shortened duringcell division. Some of our cells do show shorter telomeres in the immune system. Itsactual functional consequence is not clear.Alie: So that clearly hasn’t been the secret to–Dr. Finch: There’s no secret. There’s nothing in aging that is a secret.Aside: Does he hate me? Again, twists and turns. Listen to the end. Also, I wanted totake up the least amount of his time, so apologies for not always reading Patron names.Ya girl here was flustered. But Kelli Meeker, Julie Noble, Sarah De Smet, Kristen Long, allhad questions about Alzheimer’s, which we go back into here.Alie: What’s been the most exciting find for you and your work?Dr. Finch: Well, we made a finding in the realm of Alzheimer’s disease, that has been important,that the most toxic form of the amyloid peptide that people still considered to be one ofthe major factors in Alzheimer’s, is small aggregates rather than the large amyloidfibrils. Oligomeric A-beta was discovered in my lab here and it’s recognized as the mosttoxic component in the amyloid cascade. So that was one of our discoveries. And I wouldsay the other discovery that we publish this year is that air pollution increases theproduction of the amyloid peptide.Alie: Really?Dr. Finch: Yeah, that’s published.Alie: The difference in smaller plaques versus bigger plaques, does that signify that it mightbe more gradual of an onset?Dr. Finch: Well, people don’t think that this plaque size is the importance. This point is, in thevicinity of the amyloid plaque, which is outside of the cells in the brain substance, theneurons that are nearby are less healthy. Their projections are more twisted and theyhave more protein abnormality. That’s really the total plaque load that is associated in 11some still mysterious ways with the loss of synapses in the brain. At the end of the day,all of my colleagues and I are in uniform agreement that it’s the loss of synapses thatcauses the deterioration in Alzheimer’s when neurons can no longer talk to each otheracross synapses.Alie: And that might be impeded by the plaques, then?Dr. Finch: Yeah. The plaques in some ways seem to be causing loss of synapses. The chemistry,biochemistry, and molecular biology, this is immensely complicated and there isn’t asingle pathway that seems to account for it.Aside: So it’s the plaques that cause the loss of synapses and the question is: How dowe arrest the plaques? They’re working on it. A few folks, such as Katelyn Donald, RoseMcCathran, Shannon Patterson, Doreen Ullom-Buchan, Caroline Lewis had this nextquestion.Alie: Do you find any particular strategies for keeping your brain sharp or for maintainingneuroplasticity?Dr. Finch: Well, I told you all I know. Exercise and have an active life.Alie: Yeah. Puzzles, anything like that? No?Dr. Finch: My science is an endless set of puzzles. I don’t have to play games to challenge my brain.[clip from Backstreet Boys song: “Quit playing games with my heart.”]Aside: Patron Christopher Yarsawich asked about diets and Juan Pedro Martinez askedthis next question, specifically:Alie: What about vegetarian, veganism diets? Any evidence for those?Dr. Finch: The main point is: whatever you eat, keep your blood lipids and blood sugar low. Thereare people on vegetarian diets who live as long as people who eat meat-rich diets, butit’s harder to keep your blood properties healthy if you’re eating a lot of fatty meat and alot of salt.Aside: Patron Euan Munro said: I intermittently fast, partly for weight loss and partlybecause of the apparent benefits to longevity. How much reliable proof is out there thatfasting, or strict calorie reduction, leads to longer life in humans?Alie: What about fasting and caloric restriction? Any evidence that it slows aging or gives thebody a break?Dr. Finch: Well, in humans there’s no evidence that fasting or starvation does more than lowersblood lipids. But on a long-term basis, extreme caloric restriction for most people issimply not sustainable. Doctors who treat obesity have agreed that you can only go sofar with somebody who has been obese to diet and exercise. There’s something else thatcauses them to bounce back. My colleague Valter Longo, who has the lab right down thehall, a former student of mine, has made some important discoveries that a fastingmimicking diet, really only a couple of days a month, improves blood chemistry.Aside: I looked him up and boom. ValterLongo.com has the secrets to life, whichapparently are not secrets if you just give them away for free on a webpage. Seriously,check that out. Among the bullet points was:Eat mostly vegan, plus a little fish, limiting meals with fish to a maximum of two or threeper week. Choose fish, crustaceans, and mollusks with a high omega-3, omega-6, and 12vitamin B12 content (salmon, anchovies, sardines, trout, clams). Pay attention to thequality of the fish, choosing those with low levels of mercury. Confine all eating towithin a 12-hour period; for example, start after 8am and end before 8pm. Don’t eatanything within three to four hours of bedtime. There you go.Now, regardé, there is no mention of Miller High Life or spiking your Folgers with gasstation whiskey, or smoking cigars, so probably don’t do that. Anyway, that informationwas it. ValterLongo.com.Alie: What is the hardest thing about your job or the part about your job that you dislike themost?Dr. Finch: Oh, there’s nothing that I dislike. I’m happy to say that I’m no longer running largetraining grants and I’m no longer the director of the Alzheimer’s Center, which wasanother 20 to 30 hours a week on top of everything else I do. So, I’ll be 79 and I amenjoying the freedom to not have a large number of people answering to me. I have agroup of highly talented, highly motivated people in my research lab and we’re doing alot of good science.Alie: What’s your favorite part about the field or what you do?Dr. Finch: Surprise.Alie: Yeah?Dr. Finch: Yeah.Alie: Still get a lot of it, right?Dr. Finch: Well, the complexities of biology are just awesome. Amazing. Every year there’s a newlevel of mechanisms, sub-cellularly, or in how organs talk to each other. It’s justendlessly fascinating.Aside: [high pitched voice] Does this man slow down?Alie: Do you have a seventh book on the way?Dr. Finch: Yes, there’s going to be a popular-level book on air pollution in the next year or a yearand-a-half.Alie: That’s great. Do you drink a lot of caffeine? How do you do all this?Dr. Finch: I have two cups of coffee a day.Alie: Seems to be working.Dr. Finch: That’s all I need.Alie: That’s all you need.Aside: I’m spending the last two minutes of my time with him just really going for it,y’all.Alie: Very stupid question. Did you ever see the movie Benjamin Button, and how did you feelabout it? Dr. Finch: I did see it. I thought it was clever.Alie: Okay!Dr. Finch: I enjoyed the script writer’s imagination and could second guess some of the decisionshe made. I saw that 5 years ago.13Alie: Yeah. I was just curious. It seemed like it would be ripe for a lot of mistakes in aging.Dr. Finch: Well, I mean, you go to the movies to be entertained. You read a novel to be entertained.This is not a scientific experience.Alie: [laughs] It was not a documentary, from what I recall.Dr. Finch: Of course not! It was an amusing fantasy.Alie: Any other things that you’re excited about working on or you think people should knowabout the aging process or taking care of themselves?Dr. Finch: Well, I’m collaborating with some anthropologists in a group of people who live in theBolivian Amazon. What’s fascinating about these people at , they’re living underconditions of 200 years ago, without medication, and they’re growing their own food,and they all have high levels of infection. Some of them get to age 70 or 80, but what’sremarkable, a small percentage, 10% percent… Nobody lives much over 80.What’s remarkable is that their levels of arterial aging are 25 years slower than in NorthAmerica and they have almost no heart attacks or strokes. So we’re trying to understandwhat aspects of their environment, their diet, and interaction with their genes mightslow the arterial aging to such a degree.Alie: Do you think there’s anything about the gut biome that’s at play there?Dr. Finch: That’s an open question. I don’t know.Alie: We’ll see. I guess there’s a surprise and a puzzle waiting for you with that.Dr. Finch: Yep.Alie: Thank you so much for letting me ask you so many questions.Dr. Finch: Okay. Well, good questions.Alie: Thank you so much.Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. Oh, love! Whodoesn’t love Love? This episode is coming out a few days before Valentine’s Day. Love is in the airand on the shelves at Walgreens. Soon it will be in the discount aisle at Walgreens, but it will still bein our hearts and on our minds until probably the day we’re dead and returned to the Earth asscattered molecules, ready to be a frog that loves another frog. But frogs don’t get married andsome people do. So let’s learn about it. But first, little business.Thank you, as always, to the Ologies patrons. I am your grateful, humble servant. This podcastwould not exist without the folks on Patreon.com/Ologies. A dollar a month gets you in that club.Thanks to everyone for sporting Ologies merch from OlogiesMerch.com. I’ve said it before, I hopeyou wear an Ologies shirt, or pin, or hat and you find your soul mate and then I officiate yourwedding and I eat free cake.Thanks to everyone who rates the show and hits “subscribe.” Bonus points for leaving a review forme to creepily lurk and read on the show, such as this week’s. Let’s do it. Ariel Leen [phonetic] says,This podcast is 100% worth writing my first ever review. I’ve gotten sucked into topics that Inever thought I would be interested in. (I’m looking at you, postcards.) The episodes onsomnology inspired me to take the leap of faith and eliminate two of the three sleepingmedications I had been taking for years. I feel better than ever. So thanks, Alie, for putting yourheart and soul and a few bra crystals into bringing all of us so much joy.Thank you, Ariel. Everyone else, consult a doctor before changing medications. Please don’t sue me.Yay!Okay, Matrimoniology. Is it a word? Come on, DadWard, don’t go pulling legs here. Hot damn, is itever! Kind of. First off, the term ‘matrimony’ comes from the Latin for ‘mother’. As in, ‘to make amother out of someone’. Gross! But now matrimony is used as a catchall for marriage stuff. A nowdeceased psychologist from the Czech Republic coined the term ‘matrimoniology’, wrote severalbooks on marriage and relationship psychology, so it exists in the literature. I say it counts. So Ienlisted the help of new intern Haeri Kim. They helped me track down one of the foremostAmerican experts in the field who happens to teach, not in Prague, but in LA. So I just shimmiedover to UCLA on a sunny morning, and I set up a few mics. I asked this Ologist questions that hadboth adorable and also sometimes very uncomfortable answers. Just like a relationship: adorable,sometimes uncomfortable.He is a Professor of Social Psychology and a researcher at UCLA’s Marriage Lab. There’s a marriagelab! And he’s a co-author of the textbook Intimate Relationships and has written innumerablepapers on the topic, many of which have juicy as hell titles, such as: “To Know You Is to Love You:The Implications of Global Adoration and Specific Accuracy for Marital Relationships,” and “Howstress hinders adaptive processes in marriage.” Oooh, this is the good stuff.We sat down to discuss romantic intimacy, how marriage differs from non-married relationships,what to do if your partnership is going through a little bit of a rough patch, why divorces happen,how movies could save your relaysh, strategies for popping the question, the darker historical sideof marriage, and then, maybe per usual, I have a life-changing epiphany. No spoilers.2Sit back, commit to this amazing and wild ride with someone who, technically speaking, in someparts of the world would be considered a Matrimoniologist, Dr. Ben Karney.----------Alie Ward: You are sort of a matrimoniologist?Dr. Ben Karney: I mean, technically I’m a psychologist. If you want to get more specific, I’m asocial psychologist. There’s lots of different kinds of psychology at universities.And social psychology is the study of how human beings, individual humanbeings are affected by the imagined or real presence of other human beings,which is to say it’s the study of the human condition.Alie: Oh, that sounds so poetic.Ben: But it’s true. We are the ones who study scientifically what it means to be a human being onthe planet Earth. Within social psychology and all these different ways that human beingsinteract, my own interest has always been in intimacy and how people develop and maintainintimate connections, specifically romantic connections. And I have studied that in thecontext of marriage, but my interest is broader than just marriage. Marriage is a veryconvenient place to study adult intimacy because it’s where a lot of adults will end uppracticing their adult intimacy for large portions of their lives.So I’ve studied marriage my whole life… my whole professional life, the last 25 years. But forme, marriage is a specific case of a broader interest in intimacy, in how people experiencelove and what happens to that experience over time.Aside: Quick background on Ben. He grew up in LA but he got his Bachelor’s in Psychologyfrom just this little college called fricken’ Harvard, then came back to California to get his PhDin Social Psychology from UCLA, where he’s now, of course, a professor who studies intimaterelationships. But how did he know that this field was “the one”?Alie: And of all the different facets of social psychology, why intimacy?Ben: Honestly, because that’s what I was naturally thinking about when it came time to think,“What am I going to study?” What actually happened is that I got to graduate school in 1990,and I actually went to graduate school here at UCLA where I ended up many years later onthe faculty. And I didn’t know what I wanted to study. I knew I loved this idea of socialpsychology. I knew that the ways that human beings interact was fascinating, and puzzling,and compelling for me. But I didn’t know what I was going to really study and I kind ofdrifted.A very kind faculty member noticed that I was drifting. Her name was Anne Peplau. She’s stillaround, although she’s retired. Anne Peplau called me into her office and said, “Hey, how’syour first year of grad school going?” which she didn’t have any obligation to do. She didn’tneed to do that, but she was just very kind. I said, “I don’t know. I’m studying differentthings.” And she said, “Well, are you studying what you want to study? What do you… what isit that you actually came here to study?” I said, “I don’t know.” She goes, “Well, why don’t yougo think about it for a while?”Alie: [laughs] And how could she tell you that you were drifting?Ben: I don’t know. I think because… I don’t know why she took an interest. It was one of the mostgenerous things anyone’s ever done for me, though.3Alie: And so what did you do when you went and thought about it? Were you dating someone atthe time? Were you single? Were you struggling in that area?Ben: That’s a good question. I had just started dating someone that I’d had a long-term crush on incollege. After college, we had gotten together, so I was thinking about intimacy. I wasthinking, “How do we fall in love with people? How do relationships change? How doessomeone that you know for a long time suddenly become your partner? How do two peoplewho are strangers to each other, go from strangers to needing each other?” That seemed likea miraculous… it is a miracle, right?If you’re a single person right now, somewhere on the planet, there’s someone, and probablyclose by, who some years from now you’ll say, “Oh my god, that person touched me. Thatperson is so important to me, I couldn’t live without that person.” And yet, now you have noidea who that person is. It’s insane.Alie: I know! I have a friend named Kathy who, she was at a birthday party, her future husbandwas there, they never even talked! They met online a year later. They were at the samebirthday party!Aside: So yes, my friends Kathy and Sandin, [ph.] they’re in the same photos of this birthdayparty. This was a year before they met and started dating via OkCupid. So now they’remarried. They have a rescue poodle. Life is wild, is all I am saying. Just go talk to everyone atevery party. Maybe you can smell them, see what that does for you. I don’t know. I’m not adoctor.Also, on my way to this interview, I took a Lyft because UCLA parking is just a dystopianhellscape. You can see the microbiology episode for more on that. And I was talking to thedriver about this episode on the way to record it and I promised him that I would ask hisquestion right away and not chicken out. So boy howdy, did I.Alie: What about you? My Lyft driver, Nicholas, wanted me to ask: Are you married? You have awedding ring on. How many times have you been married?Ben: Me? I am married. I have been divorced. I was divorced. I was married to my first wife and wegot divorced after I had been studying marriage for a long time, like many, many years. Andthen I married again. And I’m very happily married.Alie: So you’ve experienced literally all sides of this dice.Ben: Yes. I have been a participant in the whole phenomenon. And people ask me, of course. Theysay, “So you study marriage. You literally have written a book on intimacy. So, how is it thatyou got divorced?” And my response to that, I have a ready one, is, “Oh, I understand why Igot divorced.” [laughs] And one of the things that I studied for a long time is that noteverything about your relationship, our relationships, are controllable. Things happen inrelationships that are beyond your control, and the idea that “if you just work hard enoughyou can make any relationship work,” is not true. I don’t believe that’s true.Alie: And you can say that from a personal and from a scientific perspective.Ben: Yes. It turns out I could say it… I was saying it for a long time from a scientific perspective andthen I experienced it.Alie: That is great, as a scientist, that you have experienced all those facets. I’m sure that it is noteasy as a person, but as an actual, kind of, objective observer to other people’s behavior, thatmust be very helpful. 4Ben: I would have preferred not to experience it. [laughs] If I could have chosen, I would havepreferred very strongly not to have experienced that.Alie: Now, what about when you were a graduate student? You started turning your eye towardintimacy, and then at what point did the marriage lab here at UCLA exist? How did you getinvolved?Ben: Well, it’s interesting. It’s fortuitous. It’s luck. My career is a cascade of lucky breaks that Ididn’t do much to create or that I just fell into and am grateful for every day. I’m a big believerin luck and circumstance, and that is my scholarly interest in the effect of luck andcircumstance on marriage, and I’ve definitely experienced that.So what happened is, I came back to Anne Peplau after a week or so, and I said, “If I could bepaid to think of something that I already think about, that’d be pretty great. If my whole life…if my job could be to ponder systematically and professionally something that I would alreadyponder, that’d be awesome!” And what I find myself thinking about all the time, that I don’thave to be encouraged to think about, that I already think about, is love. How do people fall inlove? How do we fall out of love? And that latter question is really the one that really puzzlesme because nobody wants to fall out of love.Everyone wants to find love. No mystery there. [clip from Sex and the City: Carrie, “I amsomeone who is looking for love. Real love.”] The mystery is that once two people find that,how is it so fragile? That’s the mystery. Because two people who fall in love experience, “Thisis amazing! This is great! Do you want to keep feeling this way? I do! Let’s both do that!” Andif you get married, for example, you don’t just want that, you actually promise to do that, andyou don’t promise it privately, you promise it publicly in front of everybody.Alie: In front of everyone. Everyone you’ve ever met that means anything to you.Ben: … is now listening to you say, “This is it! Count me out of the dating market. I’m going to bewith this person here forever!” [clip from The Princess Bride: “Mawage. Mawage is wot bwingsus togevah todaaay.”] It would be a terrible idea to change your mind. It’d be costly;financially costly, emotionally costly, and it’s embarrassing.Alie: You’re wearing the most expensive pants you have ever worn.Ben: Very expensive pants! And people are giving you monogrammed stuff. You can’t return it.Alie: I know! So then what happens from a neurological perspective, in terms of, like, do ourdopamine levels go crazy and then they wane naturally? How do you figure that out?Ben: You know, my interest is not in the neurological level. There are people who study theneurological level and they’re saying, “Here’s what goes on… here’s what brain regionsactivate.” I’m more interested in the phenomenological level of experience. So I’m interestedin: How do people experience a change that they don’t want that happens anyway?Aside: In case you are like “Shoot! What is the brain cocktail that’s making me feel like awalking heart-eyed emoji/eggplant emoji/peach emoji/ very creepy newish drooling faceemoji?” (which they shouldn’t have green-lit. Why did they make that one? It’s so gross.) Well,neurobiologists at the Loyola Sexual Wellness Clinic say that dopamine, adrenalin, andnorepinephrine increase when two people get really smitten with each other. And then ourbuddy dopamine makes you feel euphoric, kinda like Tom Cruise jumping on a couch. Whileadrenaline and norepinephrine make your heart literally go pitter-pat, faster, and they focusyour attention on this crush you have. 5So evidently, love lowers your serotonin levels, which these researchers say is common inpeople with obsessive-compulsive disorders, which tracks if you’ve ever refreshed someone’sInstagram like you’re being paid to monitor them, and said, “Why, why, why, why am I doingthis? Why am I doing this, why am I doing this, stop doing thiiiissss.”So Dr. Ben Karney also says that minds are very hard to change and we’ve known this for,like, all of time. But in the 1950s a psychologist named Leon Festinger studied this anddubbed it ‘cognitive dissonance’ which is that excruciating discomfort when you’re holdingtwo very conflicting thoughts.Festinger and colleagues studied a cult that was started by a midwestern housewife-cumdoomsday prophet who kept promising all of her followers that spacemen were coming verysoon, any minute, to take them all away. And her followers kept believing in her even though,like, “Where are these spacemen?” She was like “Mmm… They’re stuck in, like, so much spacetraffic.” Anyway, this woman’s name was Dorothy Martin and I really wish that for brandingpurposes, she had just popped an extra ‘a’ in that name and just went for Dorothy Martian.Can you imagine? That would have been so sick.Anyway, people never tend to change their minds except anything about, I guess, love.Ben: About people’s love relationships or let’s say their marriages, people do change their mind.Alie: About their partnerBen: About their partner. “I said I was going to love you forever. I thought I was going to love youforever. I thought this is the best relationship ever. I’m totally going to never change,” andthen people do, even though it’s costly, even though they don’t want to, even though it’sembarrassing. That’s a real mystery. And people do change their minds, all the time, abouttheir love relationships. “I thought you were the one. I thought you were my soulmate.Surprise, surprise. I must have a different soulmate because you ain’t it.”Alie: Do you even think, as a social psychologist, that soulmates exist? Or is that a convenient thingthat we apply to one person so that we don’t think about the soulmate that might be on thenext train car even though we’re married?Ben: I do not believe that there are soulmates. I believe that relationships are processes thatpeople work at, and people can work hard to have a good relationship with a variety ofdifferent people and those relationships will be different. So the good relationship you havewith some person is different than the good relationship you might have with another person.There’s some research on: What’s the impact on a relationship of thinking about soulmates?Of believing in soulmates?Alie: And?Ben: It’s not that great. [“Oh no.”] For example, if you really believe in soulmates and then you andyour partner, who you think is your soulmate, are having a fight, it might lead you to say, “Uhoh, maybe you’re not my soulmate.” [Price is Right loser horns]Alie: And now, what was your PhD work geared toward? What was your dissertation about?Ben: So after I went back to Anne Peplau and said, “I think I want to study love relationships,” shesaid, “Oh, that’s an interesting coincidence because there’s this guy that was just hired here atUCLA named Thomas Bradbury.” Young guy. It was his first job, and he actually studiesmarriages. Tom Bradbury was studying newlyweds in the community, and then followingthem over time to see, in the first few years, who stayed – you know, newlyweds are pretty 6happy – which ones of them stay happy, which ones get less happy, which ones get divorced,and he was also videotaping them. So it wasn’t just asking them questions, he wasvideotaping them and coding what he saw in the video tapes.I met him and said, “Hey, can I work with you?” And he said, “Sure.” And that was 26 yearsago and we’re still working together because he’s still on the faculty here. We write bookstogether, and we get grants together, and we are still working together.Alie: What’s the secret to that healthy partnership?Ben: Gee… It is probably the longest successful adult relationship I’ve had. And the secret is, Ithink, that I lucked out; that Thomas Bradbury happens to be a fantastic person.Alie: Well, I guess that’s part of selection.Ben: It’s totally selection. Yes! Actually, that’s a very good point! One of the things that’s comingout from the work that we’ve been doing the last few years is, it really matters who youchoose. Because where your relationship begins says a lot about where it’s going to go. [clipfrom Rihanna song Work: Drake, “If you had a twin, I would still choose you.”] I do think thatsome people are less fortunate and that the person that you meet when you’re feeling readyto get married and you’re like, “Oh, wait a minute, I’m ready to get married, and you’re hereand available, and we get along well enough…” I think a lot of people get married that way,and you want to be lucky.Alie: So the selection of partners sometimes is based on opportunity and not compatibility?Ben: So, the only people you can possibly judge your compatibility with are the people that youmeet, the people you have the opportunity to meet. So opportunity comes first, and thenselection and compatibility. And I truly think that we’ve, as a culture, emphasized selection asif it’s a much more active process than it is.Alie: What is happening then? When someone picks a partner, what is really going on socially,emotionally? What is falling in love? What is that process?Ben: All right, let’s talk about that because I think there’s a lot of confusion about that process eventhough people experience it. If you believe, for example, what dating sites tell you, or whatmatching sites tell you, then you would think that finding a partner is about measuringsomebody and measuring their, sort of, qualities and finding someone whose qualities arecompatible with your own qualities.Aside: I started wondering what… let’s not say the weirdest or creepiest dating sites are,let’s say the most niche. I mean sure, you’ve got your DateaGolfer.com. There’sGlutenFreeSingles.com. But what if you only want to date someone with, like, a speak-to-themanager haircut up front, but a smokin’ pony in the back? Well, you can head on over toMulletPassions.com. You can date a goth at AltScene.com. There’s NaturistPassions; theymight have your future significant other who is currently nude but wearing sandals.There’s also a site for horse lovers [silly voice] looking for a stable relationship, as endorsedby Oprah herself. [clip from Oprah: female guest, “… I knew from the time I had the idea, itwould put people together who love horses, and it’s a perfect match.” Oprah:“EquestrianSingles.com.”]Cat enthusiasts can cuddle up via PURRsonals.com. Can you even? Maybe you’re looking forlove but everyone around you is dead, because you are a professional in the death industry.Well don’t let your heart grow cold, just go meet someone new at DeadMeet.com, who’s alive. 7If you are sick of clowning around on Tinder because there aren’t enough clowns on it, youcan flop those big ol’ feet over to ClownDating.com, whose website makes the resonantimperative, “Everyone loves a clown. Let a clown love you.” So go on, get your horn honked.[hand horn honking]Ben: It turns out that a lot of those assumptions are just false. For example, one of the assumptionsof those algorithms is that similarity is a good thing and it’s easily measured. In fact, if youthink about just a little bit, you realize that similarity doesn’t help us very much becausepeople are so complicated. I can always find ways that I’m similar to somebody if I like thatperson and I can find ways I’m dissimilar to somebody if I don’t like that person.Aside: So we can find similarity where we want to find it, essentially. Similarities aren’twhat’s at the heart of attraction and romance. So what is?Ben: The best research says that initial romantic chemistry comes from an interaction betweentwo people that involves responsiveness, that makes both people feel understood, and heard,and excited. But it is a behavior. It’s a dance. So it’s not that “there’s a kind of person in theworld that always makes me feel excited,” but there might be a sequence of behaviors thatmakes me feel good, and if you and I, or me and somebody, or you and somebody, show up atthe right context and have the right interaction, you might say, “Hey, this interaction ismaking me feel interesting, and excited, and aroused.” But if I had met you at a birthday partywith kids around, we wouldn’t have had that interaction and I wouldn’t have had that feeling.You see the point.Alie: Yes. So it’s really about, kind of like, a feedback loop?Ben: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. [DJ airhorn] That leads… the best dating advice nowadays, basedon research, is “Don’t worry about people’s profiles. Find somebody that you think is cuteenough, and go and interact with them as soon as possible,” because the way you evaluate…The way that people naturally evaluate romantic chemistry is through how an interactionmakes them feel. We don’t choose partners the way we choose furniture, because furnituredoesn’t have to choose us back. But partners do, so it has to be an interaction; a give and take.And that’s actually where romantic chemistry emerges from. I said something, I disclosedsomething: “I come from LA.” “Oh you come from LA?” And your enthusiasm, or your lack ofenthusiasm, makes me feel a certain way about the fact that I disclosed something. Andmaybe if you’re enthusiastic in the right way, it makes me feel good about the fact that Ishared something. It makes you want to share something else. And then if I go too longwithout asking you a question, you might say, “Huh, I was enthusiastic, but now I’m not soenthusiastic.” But if I then ask you a question and now you’ve shared something, nowsuddenly we’re building a little bit of the beginnings of intimacy because it feels good toshare. And now we’re doing the dance. But it can break down so many different ways.Alie: Well, is that what happens in marriages that are maybe starting to crumble, is you’re notgetting the feedback loop that you expected to get? Maybe your partner seems disinterestedor you’re disinterested so you’re not giving back to them and they pick up on that? Is thatkinda what happens?Ben: That’s a great question. So we’re talking about: How does romantic interest emerge? Andyour question is, is it the same process in reverse as romantic interest declines?Aside: Sorry, I don’t mean to bum you out. This might just be good to know for long-termrelationships. I’m sorry. I’m being a realist here. 8Ben: My sense is there’s a lot going on as romantic interest declines. And here’s one of the things.One of the things is that the same behaviors that can be exciting when they’re new are notnecessarily exciting when they’re old. First kiss, it doesn’t feel the same as the 500th kiss, ifyou’re lucky enough to get to the 500th kiss. If what you’re in it for is the sense of escalatingexcitement, escalating excitement is likely to fade. Now, what happens in good marriages istwo things. So let’s talk first, not about marriages that decline, but marriages that last.Alie: Yeah, that’s a good way of looking at it.Aside: Yes, let’s look at the positive. How do we keep things cute?Ben: One thing that happens is happy couples find ways to keep the excitement alive. They keepgrowing together, they keep exploring both each other and the world together. And thatkeeps… they’re always, “Wait a minute. Even though we’ve been together 15 years, eventhough we’ve been together 50 years, we still did something yesterday we’d never donebefore.” So there’s still something new, there’s something new that’s possible. But that takeseffort. It takes effort and opportunity, right? Like, if you’re working very, very hard, if you’restruggling financially, you don’t have time to say, “Hey, let’s go do something we’ve neverdone before!”Alie: Right!?! “Let’s go horseback riding!”Ben: “Ooh, that’d be so fun!” And you know, rich people do that. But people who are strugglingcan’t do that. They have to… just getting by is hard. But that means that opportunities fornovelties are hard. So another thing that successful couples do in the long term is they findother bases for their bond.Aside: The doc says that thinking someone is foxy is nice, but “Eh.”Ben: But that’s not the only thing people want from their companions. I also want someone who’sdependable. I want someone who’s reliable, someone who understands me and will supportme when I’m sick, when I’m really in trouble, when it’s the middle of the night and our kidsare throwing up because they’re sick. I want to know that you’re going to be there and canwatch my back. So good marriages can both keep excitement alive, that’s totally possible, butalso can find a broader base for why the relationship is around, the functions the relationshipserves.Alie: And is it good for partners to sit down and make lists of those interests or check in?Ben: It’s great, but most people don’t do that. Most people don’t do that for a couple reasons.Maybe a handful of reasons. One is: A lot of people think, “Oh, this just should come naturally.We shouldn’t have to talk about it.” And I don’t think that’s true. It is in the culture that “Whyshould we have to talk about it? A good relationship just happens,” as opposed to a goodrelationship… So if you believe in soulmates and like, “Well, if we’re soulmates, why shouldwe have to discuss it? [snobby hipster tone] My soul should just recognize your soul.”But if relationships are an action, a process that you have to contribute to, then… if you’re awhole different person, I need to understand who you are, and that’s going to take work. It’sgoing to take communication. Another reason people don’t do it is it can be scary. “I’massuming that we agree about a lot of things. I don’t necessarily want to know if we don’t,because that’d be a hard conversation.” When’s the right time to have a hard conversation?Alie: Never.9Ben: Never. “Let’s see, we can watch The Great British Baking Show tonight, or we can havepossibly a really difficult conversation. Ya know, I think Netflix is better.” [clip from The GreatBritish Baking Show: Paul Hollywood, “Slight soggy bottom there.”]Alie: There are so many people out there who think that you’re just a witch who’s read their mind.Ben: They’re like, “Wait a minute! You watch The Great British Baking Show?” Of course!The third reason is that lots of people don’t have the time. The truth is that life is very hardand challenging for many, many people. It’s a privilege to have the time to look at yourpartner and say, “Hey, let’s… let’s talk for a while.” That happens when your life is undercontrol. Many people have multiple jobs, bills to pay, sick family, all sorts of stress in theirlives that they’re barely staying on top of. And now it’s a lot to ask to say, “Okay, by the way,put all that aside and have a heart-to-heart talk with your partner about their hopes anddreams.” There’s many people in the world for whom that would be a luxury that they cannotafford.Aside: So as Tegan and Sarah have asked: Where does the love go?Ben says that, day by day, other things just take priority like work, and paying bills, andtaking care of the kids, and then at the bottom, the dusty end of the to-do list is “connect on ameaningful level with your life partner.”Ben: So my memories of the excitement of the things that kept us together are fewer and fartherbetween. I still remember them, but I’m like, “Wow, it’s actually been a while since we’vebeen intimate, [sexy music] since we’ve laughed or told a joke because life has been hard forus, [record scratch] or we’ve done other things. Then if that’s true, if our connection isweaker, then when something’s hard or when we disagree, now it’s harder to have thosedisagreements. My empathy for you is weaker. If I’m stressed, I’m paying more attention tomy own needs. It’s harder for me when I’m stressed to get out of my own head and into yourhead.All these factors combine. And so now we’re busy. I’m less empathetic. I’m very aware of myown unmet needs. I can’t read your mind. I’m not trying to read your mind, so I don’t knowwhat your unmet needs are. It’s easy to say, “If my needs are unmet, whose fault is it? It’s notmy fault. I know I’m working hard. I don’t know what’s in your head, but I can tell you’re righthere. It must be your fault.” So now I’m mad at you, and now the next time we disagree, well, Iget madder, and instead of each interaction building us up, making us more connected, eachinteraction breaks us down. It makes us feel a little bit less connected.And unless we make explicit efforts to try to restore that connection, and unless we’re able tomake those efforts… Again, the world has to be supporting us. We might come to a pointwhere I don’t feel what I felt, and you don’t feel what you felt, and we don’t feel like we canconnect even if we wanted to, and so now we feel helpless. Eventually, the costs of staying inthe relationship, the emotional costs, outweigh the cost of leaving, and for different people,that calculus is different.Some people will stay in a bad relationship for a long time because they have nowhere to go,or because they have kids, or they have financial connections or they feel like, “I’ll never findanother partner, so I’d rather stay with this partner even though I’m not very happy.” It takestwo people to get together, only takes one person to break up.Alie: Oh, that’s true. And where is the line there? Because I think everyone probably thinks, “Norelationship is perfect.”Ben: True. 10Alie: So everyone probably thinks that about their own relationship, right?Ben: I would hope so. I think that is true actually. You can evaluate a relationship on two levels,and what we find is that people… like newlyweds, if you ask them very specific questionsabout their partner, even newlyweds are willing to say, “Well, my partner is good at somethings, not so good at others.” Knowing somebody means knowing that person’s strengthsand their limitations.Aside: Ah that old adage. The advice handed down countless generations: To truly lovesomeone is to know in what ways areas they are useless pains in the ass.Ben: So most people will say, “Oh yeah, yeah, our relationship isn’t perfect, but it’s a greatrelationship. I love the imperfections of this relationship.”Alie: Like 4.5 stars on Yelp, maybe.Ben: Exactly. Or something like, “I wouldn’t want…” A very, very smart couple’s therapist. My wifeis a couple’s therapist and she…Alie: Oh my god! Your wife is a couple’s therapist and you’re a marriage researcher?Ben: I know. We have some interesting conversations.Alie: Oh my god! You guys are never getting divorced!Ben: I hope that’s true. I think that’s true. I think that it’s a great relationship.Alie: That’s amazing.Ben: It took a long time for us to get to this point, but we have good conversations, and one of thethings that she says is, “You know, when you commit long-term to a partner, you’recommitting to a set of strengths and limitations.” So if we get back to the idea that, to theextent that you have a choice and that you make choices, one of the things to think about is“Can I live with these limitations forever?” [clip from The Simpsons: Mr. Burns. “Don’t forget.You’re here forever.”]Another insight, I think, mostly from talking to my wife, not from research, is… I used to thinkthat the purpose of communicating in relationships was to solve problems, to solvedisagreements. I now think that disagreements do not get solved. They just get managed.Aside: Okay. But what, in a scientific, matrimoniological sense, does that mean?Ben: The purpose isn’t that I’m ever… I’m never going to convince you or anyone else of anything.So once you decide, “Okay, convincing another person is just off the table,” then it’s just amatter of saying, “How will we deal with our disagreement? How will we manage? Yes, we’regoing to always disagree about this and how are we going to manage that?” Maybe we’ll taketurns, maybe we’ll compromise on this issue in my way, but we’ll compromise on this otherissue in your way and hope it balances out. But once you realize… I think it takes a lot ofpressure off of a relationship to say, “Oh, we are not in the convincing business.” [Alie laughs]Aside: Oooo, let’s repeat that:Ben: We are not in the convincing business.Alie: Ahhaha.Ben: We are not in the convincing business.Alie, slowed and distorted to make fun of herself: “Aaahaahaa.” 11Ben: We are not in the resolving problems business. Like, “Oh, this is going to go away and thenwe’ll never talk about this again.” No, no, no. This is the thing we talk about. That’s what kindof relationship this is. “This is the relationship where this is our issue.” If I had been inanother relationship, we’d have a different issue, but this is our issue. And as you think aboutthe future, you think, “Can I live with this? Because we’re going to be talking about this fa eva?[male voice over romantic violin music, “Forever, beloved.”] I can. This is a good… I’m veryhappy with this set of limitations and strengths.”Alie: But I feel like a lot of people find that their marital discord is financially based, or at leastthat’s what I hear from people. I’m not married, but do you find that in your research? Or doyou find that finances are really just kind of like a red herring for other lifestyle choicespeople make?Ben: There’s two ways to answer that. I do a lot of research on the effect of financial circumstanceson marriage, and the effects are enormous. Enormous. We live in a country where there’s agreat deal of income inequality that has been increasing over my adult lifetime. What we’veshown in multiple studies is that where you are on the socioeconomic ladder greatly affectsthe nature of your intimacy.Aside: Whaaat? Oh shiiiit. Also, no surprise.Ben: Like in very specific, private ways, the way people interact with their partners very privatelyis affected by where they are socioeconomically. So people who are affluent, who have goodjobs and good educations, they can evaluate their relationships in a different way than peoplewho are financially struggling, and disadvantaged, under-resourced. They can evaluate theirrelationships in different ways.That doesn’t mean that it’s fundamental to specifically talk about finances, like “How are wegoing to spend money?” Because even couples that are financially struggling… If you’refinancially struggling, every disagreement is more of a struggle. And if you’re affluent, youmight talk about finances, but you might also… whatever you disagree about is going to bewhat you disagree about. I would say that the context of having or not having adequateresources in your life is fundamental. It changes the kind of time you have together. Itchanges what you do with the time you have together, and it changes the personal resourcesyou have to do the work of empathy and the work of understanding and compromise.Everything, all the work that we would call intimate work: trying to get outside your ownhead and capture your partner’s perspective, deciding when to compromise and when not tocompromise. All that work is harder if you’re financially strapped, which is why divorce ratesare much higher in low-income communities than in upper-income communities.Alie: Oh, I didn’t know that.Ben: It’s a huge effect.Aside: So one of Ben’s studies titled “Communication that is maladaptive for middle-classcouples is adaptive for socioeconomically disadvantaged couples” showed that depending onwhere you are socioeconomically, different intimate behaviors produce negative or positiveresults. So middle-class couples who withdrew in conflict had worse conflicts later, whilesocioeconomically disadvantaged couples who withdrew found more comfort in that as a deescalation technique.As for divorce stats, they are definitely higher in lower-income families. And some folkswould try to say that must be because those demographics don’t value marriage as much. 12That is a crock of horse shit. So, low-income and high-income people value marriage similarly,but being broke and working several jobs, and being stressed, and not being privileged is justreally hard on people.Ben: What’s striking is that poor communities have lower rates of marriage. When they do marry,they have higher rates of divorce. So, intimacy is challenged by challenging circumstances,and intimacy is encouraged by good circumstances, which is why people fall in love on cruiseships, because it’s easy to have a relationship on a cruise ship! It’s much easier to feelromantic when someone’s giving you a cocktail that has an umbrella in it!Alie: [laughs] Well, what about the fact that… or at least a study I read, that the more expensive awedding is, the more likely a couple is to get a divorce. Is that flimflam?Aside: This news broke in 2014 with a published paper entitled “‘A Diamond is Forever’ andOther Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration.”Researchers studied 3,000 couples in the US and they found that marriage duration isinversely associated with spending on the engagement ring and the wedding ceremony. Sospending between two and four grand on the engagement ring is associated with a 1.3xgreater hazard of divorce.Same goes for the ceremony. Weddings that cost less than a thousand dollars weresignificantly less likely to end in divorce than nuptials costing twenty grand and up. Now,$20,000, remember from the paleontology episode, could fund two dinosaur digs. I’m justsaying. Two dinosaurs!Now, don’t tell this to a guy named Said Gutseriev, son of a Russian oligarch, who married his20-year-old sweetheart, Khadija Uzhakhovs, in a celebration that cost one billion – yes, with a‘b’ – dollars in 2016. So instead of having your college roommate make a Spotify playlist, theirreception entertainment included Jennifer Lopez and Sting, which was definitely selected bytheir parents. (I mean c’mon.) Also, Enrique Iglesias, who according to some blurry Instagramphotos, was wearing jeans and a wallet chain to a billion-dollar wedding. Enrique Egregious!Also, I googled ‘how to even get married for under a thousand dollars’. Mostly just came upwith articles that said literally, like, “Take the bus to the courthouse dummy” or “Elope insecret like a celebrity for whom money is no object,” or “Get married in the backyard andhave your cousins bring a salad.”So, is starting things off without a lot of money stress and debt a good strategy for stayingmarried?Ben: It doesn’t feel fundamental to me. I haven’t gone over those data. But it’s unlikely…whatever’s going on there, it’s not about spending money on a wedding. It’s about otherthings. So, maybe if you have a lot of money to spend on a wedding, then you also have a lot offinancial independence, and people who are financially independent are able to leave theirmarriages when they go bad, should they go bad. Nobody’s arguing that, “Uh oh, don’t spend alot of money on your wedding because that’s going to break up your marriage.” That’sunlikely to be true.Alie: Are marriage rates going up? Are divorce rates going up? What’s happening now in the yearthat we’re in, 2019?Ben: The year that we’re in, 2019, here’s the trend. The trends are very different for collegeeducated and non-college-educated people. So if you look at the national trend, it would bemisleading because there’s two totally different trends happening. College-educated people 13are marrying at high rates. They’re delaying marriage, so they’re marrying later, and that hasto do with people postponing childbearing and family formation in order to get theireducation and their careers on track. The evidence of this is pretty clear. So still high rates ofmarriage, relatively low rates of divorce, even declining rates of divorce, but it’s all happeninglater.So people who went to college are saying, “Hey,” and men and women are doing this, “I have agood education. That means I can set myself up for a good career. I know that if I can get thatcareer up and running, it’s going to have benefits for my family, so I’m going to get that careerup and running, and then once I have enough money and my career is where I want it to be,then it’s time to settle down.” That’s what the college-educated people are doing.Non-college educated people are doing something totally different. They’re less likely tomarry at all. When they do marry, they marry earlier. They have kids prior to marriage athigh rates. They have very high rates of divorce, and re-partnering, and what’s called ‘maritalchurning’, which is multiple long-term partners. A totally different thing is happening there.And why? Because people who didn’t go to college, they have less reason to invest ineducation and employment because their opportunities are much more constrained. Sothey’re like, “Well, why should I postpone fertility? What am I waiting for? Why should Ipostpone parenthood?” So they’re much more likely to have kids early. But having kids earlyand marrying early is associated with higher rates of divorce.Alie: Oh, I didn’t know that… Getting married early and having kids early… I didn’t know that.Ben: It’s true. It’s very strong. These are big effects. It’s not psychological effects, it’s sociologicalthat people who marry younger… As you can imagine, if you marry in your very early 20s… Iwas a puppy when I was in my early 20s.Alie: I was a garbage fire. [laughs]Ben: People are still figuring things out. So if you get married at that age, there’s still a lot of changehappening that your relationship might not survive. People who marry later are more stable.Their personalities are more stable, their careers and more stable, so the person that theymeet at a later point is… the relationships are less likely to be buffeted by significant change.Alie: Now, what about the difference between getting married versus just long-term partnership?What happens in the brain once there’s a certificate, and a ring, and pictures, and a photoalbum, and a registry? What happens to people’s relationships?Ben: Okay. So, I think that there’s a lot of continuity. So personally, again, as I said from the verybeginning, I care about intimacy and I think that people can have intimacy that feels the sameif we defined it as, “I’m committed to somebody. I support that person. I care about thatperson.” And that can happen inside or outside of marriage. So what does marriage do? Whatdoes marriage do to change intimacy? Mostly, it changes how you as a couple are treated bythe world around you.Aside: This revelation is something that even the most well-meaning hetero couples likelytake for granted all the time: just how important outside support is. And it applies to marriedand non-married couples, as well.Ben: So if you present as, “We’re partnered but we’re not married,” then the world says, “Oh, wellthen, you’re not participating in an institution, and it’s hard for us to know what to do withyou at the hospital when you’re visiting your sick partner. Legally, what is yourresponsibility?” The world is structured in a way that privileges marriages. And people know 14this. Also, it’s harder to break up a marriage than to break up an intimate partnership. [BillLumbergh from Office Space: “Uhh… yeeah.”] You can walk away from an intimate partnership,but a marriage, you’ve got to fill out paperwork and it’s an extremely expensive andunpleasant process.Alie: [laughs] From a scientific perspective?Ben: From every perspective. [laughs] It sucks. Avoid it if you can. So what does it do to getmarried? Well, one thing it does is it declares to the world, “We want to be treated as acouple. As a legal unit. As a social unit.” Also, from the couple’s perspective, if I get married,I’m saying “I want it to be harder to leave. I want it to be harder to leave.” Which sayssomething about your level of commitment. [“Fiiight!”] Like, I’m more motivated to workthrough it because…Alie: Divorce sucks?Ben: Divorce sucks. Exactly! Whereas my motive to work through the hard parts that come up inrelationships might be a little weaker. Not necessarily, but it might be a little weaker onaverage for people who are not participating in the legal institution. So the process of: Whatdoes it mean to connect to somebody, to understand somebody? That’s the same in anyintimacy, but the institutional context makes a difference, makes certain behaviors harderand certain behaviors easier.Alie: And how have you seen in your research, because you’ve been researching this for 20 years,but same-sex marriage, hasn’t been legal the entire time, so in the LGBTQ community, howhave you seen changes sociologically?Ben: Well, I wish I knew more about that. When I started studying intimacy and marriage, samesex marriage was not legal anywhere in the United States.Alie: Which is crazy.Ben: Which is crazy. But it all happened in my lifetime, which is terrific and a welcomedevelopment. One of the interesting things about the rapid change and rapid acceptance, thelegal acceptance of same-sex marriage, is that lots of same-sex couples who were together fora long time, who never had the option of getting married, suddenly had the option of gettingmarried. And so there was an interesting process, which is “If we’ve already been together 20years, I knew I was going to be with you forever, but marriage wasn’t on the table. Now thatmarriage is on the table, do we do it or do we not do it?” And there is a study that is left to bedone. There’s a study that needs to be done there about how that decision is made. I haven’tgathered that data.Aside: Ben does say that other countries have gathered data on this and, overall, same-sexmarriages are much less likely to end in divorce than opposite-sex marriages. In Belgium,between 2004 and 2009, the average annual divorce rate for same-sex marriages was lessthan 2% and the total rate of divorce was 11%. Now in Norway and Sweden, the same-sexmarriage divorce rates are 50% lower than opposite-sex marriages, but among those, lesbiancouples do divorce more than same-sex marriage among men.Researchers find that women across all types of marriages tend to be the ones to initiatesplits because their needs typically aren’t being met. So in the US, over 2/3 of all divorces inall couples are initiated by wives because, they think, women are more socialized to payattention to their relationships, and are more financially dependent on a partnership, sobeing in a bad marriage has greater emotional consequences for women, essentially. 15Also, if you’re wondering where the data is, the 2020 Census will at long last have a space forsame-sex couples to mark for marriages, which is a tiny victory, especially in light of thecurrent US administration trying to add in a question about citizenship while leaving outquestions about sexual orientation and gender identity, which leaves a lot of LGBTQ people,especially the unmarried folks, unrepresented and under-funded. Essentially invisible. Whichsucks and needs fighting.Speaking of fighting, but in a less-valiant sense, I also asked him about what happens whenany couples, any couples, get back together and break up, and back and forth, back and forth.Kind of like a Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor married-and-divorced situation. Elon Muskmarried actress Talulah Riley twice. Divorced her twice also.So, as a person who has gotten back together with my exes, I asked him for selfish reasons.Ben said that beyond the obvious reasons of absence making the heart grow fonder andforgetting how boring or annoying someone is when they’re not around to bore or annoy you,there are some other factors at play when you break up and get back together with someone.Ben: Another explanation is there are certain people who, between themselves, are struggling tobalance closeness versus independence. So there are people who struggle... There’s anothertheory called attachment theory. The idea that different people have different comfort levelswith closeness and independence. Some people want really a lot of closeness and somepeople really aren’t comfortable with being too close and too dependent on another person,really value their independence.So there are some people who, in their struggle to balance that, find themselves drawn to aperson, but they don’t want to be too close. They push away, but they don’t want to be totallyclose, so they come back together, and those people often dance around each other for a longtime trying to form that balance.Alie: How important is humor and laughter in easing conflict and establishing those bonds andthat feedback?Ben: It’s really important. Some of our research has touched on that. What we did in one of ourstudies was videotape newlyweds talking about problems and you can code these tapes. Youcan watch the tapes and actually count how many positive behaviors and how many negativebehaviors. You can even say how many positive verbal behaviors and you can also code thatsort of nonverbal behaviors, the emotional expressions.Generally, people who exchanged negative behaviors – anger, blaming, insults – well, that’sgoing to be a bad thing. But what we found was that if those negative behaviors happen in thesame interaction where people are being positive as well, and most of the positivity we see ishumor and affection, the negative behaviors had much less of an effect.Alie: Really?Ben: And why? Here’s why. If we’re disagreeing and I’m mad at you, I’m Super Mad, but at thesame time that we’re having this mad disagreement, I’m definitely angry, I can also throw in alittle joke or a little affection. What’s the message? The message is: the fact that we’re maddoesn’t mean I don’t still like you. But that’s the point. That’s an incredibly importantmessage, which is, “You’ve hurt me. You’ve disappointed me, but obviously we’re stillconnected.” The positivity is a reminder of that connection.I think humor can serve an incredibly important function, and positivity can be especiallyimportant if you can manage to find it where it’s most needed, which is in the context of a 16disagreement. Being able to say, “Yes, we’re disagreeing and I don’t want to let this go, but Iam keeping it in perspective. But still, I think you’re cute and I think that this is fun. Andobviously, we’re going to be dealing with this forever because I’m not going anywhere.” Thatcan be a very powerful message. That is a way of reassuring your partner even in the midst ofthe hard part. So, again, it’s complicated, but humor is potentially an incredibly powerful toolalong with affection that can help people through the rockiest parts of relationships.Alie: I bet. My parents have been married for 49-and-a-half years.Ben: That’s incredible.Alie: I know, and they’re still… I hear ‘em yuckin’ it up, laughing to themselves, joking with eachother.Ben: That’s amazing.Alie: I know. They’ll go to bed and then I’ll hear them giggling, laughing. I’m like “What are theytalking about?”Ben: The other thing is, think about what a joke is. A joke is something that surprises you. Like agood joke is something that is a novelty. So what they’re doing is they’re surprising eachother, right? They’re still telling you that, like, if I can make each other laugh… they’re saying,“It tickles me because you’re telling me something I didn’t know.” So they’re still finding newthings 49-and-a-half years later. That’s amazing! They’re amazing! Bottle it up, sell it!Alie: I know. Well, the reason why they got married is my mom just thought my dad was hot andthen it turned out they were both good people.Ben: Okay. So they’re lucky too.Alie: I know. They got engaged after a month. What am I supposed to do with that?Ben: Well, be lucky. Try to be lucky. Of course, you can’t try to be lucky so you do what you can.Alie: You just appreciate when you are I guess.Ben: But I think the story… There’s been lots of research asking long-term married couples,“What’s the secret to your success?” And I think long-term couples will say “Sense of humor.We worked really hard at it. We just decided we’re going to be together and we werecommitted and we would never let anything break us up.” That’s all true and it’s all good, butwhat’s hard to recognize is how lucky the long-term couples are.I really try to not say, “Well, it’s all hard work” because the implication then is, if yourrelationship went bad, you didn’t work hard enough, or maybe you’re too stupid, you justdidn’t know how to have a better relationship. Believe me, if it’s all about knowing what to do,relationship scientists would all have perfect relationships. I know a lot of relationshipscientists, my best friends are relationship scientists, and we don’t always have perfectrelationships because it’s not only about knowing. It’s about being able to. It’s not enough tohave read the book and say, “Well, it says here I should tell a joke.” It’s about being able toactually find that joke in the moment, about having problems that you can joke about. Noteveryone’s lucky.Alie: Can I ask you questions from listeners?Ben: Okay.Alie: Oh my gosh. Okay. I’m going to run through it because I know that you’re busy. 17Ben: Go for it. Lightning round!Alie: Okay. Lightning round. You ready?Ben: Yeah.Aside: Before this lightning round with listener questions from Patreon, a quick break tochat about Ologies’ sponsors. So, you may hear a few phone calls in which I ring up a patron,one-on-one, to tell them about the amazing, hand-picked, and Ward-approved sponsors of theshow. Also, please know that a portion of the proceeds from ads goes to a cause of theOlogist’s choosing. I’m going to tell you about this week’s in the show outro so you have morecontext because it does matter this week. I encourage you to listen to the whole episode,including the outro. It’s really important stuff.[Ad Break]Now, on to your matrimoniological questions.Alie: These are from patrons. So many great questions. Savannah Martin-Collins, SonyaCarperlovik, [ph.] and some other people wanted to know: What’s up with common lawmarriages? Do you see any differences between people who are common law and people whoaren’t?Ben: Not a lot of great research on that. But let’s speculate for a second. What is the common lawmarriage? It’s a marriage that is recognized as a legal partnership even though they’ve not…because of the length of time people have been together. Not every state recognizes commonlaw marriages. I think California, where we’re currently having this conversation, doesn’t, butI could be wrong about that.Alie: I’ll look into it.Aside: According to LegalZoom, who I imagine is just helping folks navigate throughSplitsville, most states do not recognize common law marriages. This was news to me. So thestates that right now do recognize common law marriages include… And I encourage you todo a tiny but acceptable butt dance if you feel excited to hear your state called. Ready?Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, NewHampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah.Buzzkill: same-sex relationships are never recognized as common law. Also, there’s no suchthing as a common law divorce, so you need not bellow in the public square, [old-timey voice]“Thou hast been ousted from my heart!” The law still doesn’t care. Just pack up and go. Justdivvy up the Blu-rays, cry into some nachos, spend what you would have spent on legal feeson a solo trip to Cancun. Don’t get beach braids.Ben: We were talking about this, essentially, that the intimacy is the same. Two people who’venever had a wedding ceremony but decided, “You’re my person and I’m just not goinganywhere.” The challenges of “How are we going to understand each other? How are wegoing to address our disagreements? How are we going to compromise?” The same. Intimacyis the same, but the support you get is probably less, because if you’re not wearing a ring, ifyou haven’t been saying to the world, “My wife. My husband,” then the world doesn’t treatyou as a social unit or legal unit, which means you don’t have that kind of support. So that’sgoing to be, I think, a challenge.The challenges come from outside, and they might be more challenging for common lawmarriages than for a legal, and… I don’t know what the alternative phrase is. Again, the 18challenges of intimacy are the same, but you’re at slightly different circumstance becausepeople don’t recognize the institution you’re participating in.Alie: That makes sense. On the topic of intimacy, many people had this question. Carla Kennedyand Wendy Fick said: Any helpful tips for salvaging sexual intimacy if one partner isn’tinterested anymore? Wendy asked: What typically happens to the physical part of arelationship? Do some relationships become platonic?Ben: Well, clearly some do because the answer to the question, “Does this ever happen?” is always,“Yes.” If two people are okay with that, then no problem. But if two people aren’t okay withthat, then a big problem. So then the first step, it seems to me, is to figure out… is tocommunicate, is to talk.There’s a lot of research that shows that sexual connection is a subset of emotionalconnection. And so developing an emotional connection is one really important way todevelop, to revive a sexual connection and say, “Hey, what’s going on? Are we emotionallyconnected?” There’s research that shows that people who can communicate more effectivelyhave more sex. So if one partner is unsatisfied with the amount of sex that they’re having orthe quality of their sex life, communication is going to be the first step.The other thing that comes up with sexual connection is the role of novelty and expansion.There’s a theorist guy named Arthur Aron, a social psychologist, who has a theory called selfexpansion theory. Self-expansion theory is the idea that the thrill of relationships comes fromthe thrill of becoming more than we are. That’s a fundamental motivation, says Dr. Aron. Andwhen I get to know somebody else and we become a unit, well, I used to be me, now I’m us. Sonow I’m more than I was and that’s thrilling. But once I become ‘us’, if we don’t continue togrow, well then we’re not expanding anymore. I’ve expanded, I’m definitely a part of us, butwe’re just who we’ve always been and that can get boring.So, the way to deal with that is, “How can we become more? What can we do that’s new? Whatcan we do that’s different?” And that often is a place where sexual excitement comes from too.Like, “Wow, I see you in a new light because we’ve done something new that we haven’t donebefore, even if it’s not necessarily something sexual that we haven’t done before.” So seeingopportunities for growth, seeing opportunities for connection, that’s a good way. Talkingdirectly.The other thing that often gets in the way of sex is that people are tired. People are stressed.And if I say, “Hey, how come we’re not having enough sex?” and I’m not acknowledging whatthe obstacles that are getting in the way for you, well then that’s not going to be a great routebecause now I’m making another demand. Sex is now another demand. So sometimes youhave to take a step back and say, “Well, hey, what’s going on with my partner?” Andsometimes sex is really a side issue to other issues. People are unhappy, or tired, oroverburdened, and those are the obstacles that have to be addressed first before we can dealwith sex.Alie: Which dovetails to a great question from Jessica Chamberlain, Kjersti Chippindale, ElizabethGonye, and Lauren Kelly: What role do you find children or the lack thereof playing inmarriage? Do you find them more rewarding with or without children? And that other peopleare like, “What do you do when your kids are draining you of your energy?”Ben: The transition to parenthood is one of the most profound changes that a person canexperience. Let alone a marriage. So it is a profound change. There’s research on the effect ofthe transition to parenthood on relationships. One of the findings of that research is that the 19early years of having kids… it’s very challenging because kids are very demanding, [pleading,whiny voice, “I hate it. I fucking hate it.” ] and that most relationships bounce back after awhile and return to where they were prior to the transition to parenthood.An implication of that is that having a strong, solid connection prior to becoming parents is agreat thing. Like, that becomes a really important resource because even though you’re like,“Well, this is a difficult period. We’re up all night, our kids are not sleeping, we have a lot ofdemands. I’m with one kid, you’re with the other kid, but we’re connected. I know that this isrelatively temporary.”The other thing that’s true nowadays is the expectations for parents, especially collegeeducated parents, are higher now than they were a generation or two ago. Parents expect tospend more time with their kids and do more with their kids. And that means that there’s lesstime for the adult relationship. There’s less time for the parental relationship. There are only24 hours in a day. So something has to give. So the question is… Let’s say you’re a greatparent, you want to be a great parent, you want to say, “I want to give my kids as many hoursas I can, but I also want to give my kids access to a great adult relationship between me andmy other caregiver.” So that might mean investing in the relationship and putting my kidssomewhere, you know, with a grandparent, if you’re lucky enough to have a grandparent thatyou trust, or another kind of caregiver if you’re lucky enough to have one.Alie: Let ‘em go run in a field.Ben: Or let ‘em go run in the street! Exactly right. So this is the thing… of course we don’t let kidsrun in the street anymore.Alie: Right. That’s how I grew up. [laughs]Ben: It’s how I grew up! And yet that’s not considered… A lot of things that I did as a kid would beconsidered neglect now.Alie: We just ran into a field and scraped our knees on barbed-wire fences and…Ben: Nobody knew where we were! Exactly. So this is the challenge, it really is a challenge. And somodern parents, especially college-educated parents, really do have to struggle with, “Howam I going to invest each hour?” And the investment in the relationship is still vital. And ittakes investment. You have to find time to maintain that connection so that you will have thatconnection to show your kids and to make you better parents for your kids.Alie: Right? Because it’s going to be harder for them to model a good relationship if they didn’t seeone.Ben: Exactly. So people think, “Oh well it’s now all about the kids and I owe that to my kids.” Youalso owe to your kids having a good relationship.Alie: That’s good advice. That’s great advice!Ben: I try not to be in the advice business, but I think that’s consistent with research.Alie: I got a few questions about proposing. Tina Rautio wants to know: Why won’t my partner offour years propose? And then Kelli Brockington asks: Why doesn’t Tina propose? And alsoMadalyn Rogers says: This isn’t a question, but it would be pretty great if someone proposedto their certain significant other in a Patreon question for this episode. Also, someone wrotein saying that she is proposing to her partner today!Ben: Congratulations! That’s exciting! 20Alie: I know. So Lexi Gagne is getting proposed to by Shelise today.Ben: Good job. Lexi and Shelise. That’s wonderful.Aside: PS: I called that listener Shelise after we recorded this. Lexi said Yes! They soundamazing and adorable. Yay!Alie: But in proposing, how does a partner, especially in a patriarchal society, who maybe is awoman or is waiting to get proposed, like how do we decide who decides it’s time to ask?Ben: Yeah. Not a lot of good research on this. My research always takes place with couples that aremarried. A lot of my work is on newlyweds, so recently married. We asked them though,“How’d you propose?” And the couples that we talked to say this, they say, “Oh, we knew wewere going to get married. And the proposal was essentially, you know, theater. Like theproposal was a ritual that we liked, but it wasn’t fundamental to the relationship, or rather, itwas a symptom of the relationship. We have a relationship where he does romantic things tome all the time or she does romantic things and the proposal was another romantic thing, butit wasn’t the romantic thing.”So I think we’ve built up proposals in the same way we have built up weddings, and proms,and a lot of sort of rituals as if, “Oh, that’s got to be special.” And there’s nothing wrong with itbeing special, but a relationship is not about one day, no matter how special it is. It’s notabout what happened on your wedding day. It’s not about even what happened on yourproposal day, you know. It can go great or can go poorly, but what keeps the relationshipalive is the day-to-day process of connection, of managing difference.I fundamentally don’t think it matters that much. It’s nice, it’s wonderful and if you celebrateValentine’s Day and it’s nice and wonderful, that’s great. And if you celebrate Valentine’s andit doesn’t work and it rains, that’s also okay because that’s not where the relationship risesand falls. The relationship rises and falls on what happens each day.Now that doesn’t address the question of why people propose or not propose, or whathappens when one partner says, “I want a proposal,” and the other partner says, “I’m notready.” And that’s an old story, and that’s a story about different people being at differentplaces in terms of escalating commitment and different levels of comfort with participating inthe institution of marriage.It’s a complicated institution. It’s been many times a very, very patriarchal institution. Anddifferent people are like, “How are we going to define it? What’s it going to mean? Is ourrelationship going to change?” These are hard conversations to have. It’s often the case thatone person’s ready and the other person isn’t ready, and that’s a difference that has to bemanaged, like any other difference. And some people will say, “I can’t handle this differenceand I’m going to leave. I don’t want this. This difference is too much for me.” And other peopleare going to say, “I can handle this difference.”But I do think, and this is now me speaking not as a scientist but as a person who thinks a lotabout relationships, we can’t be in the convincing business with our partners. And if you needto convince your partner about committing to the relationship, that’s probably not a gameyou want to be in.Aside: Okay. Two side notes. I will say that New Year’s seems to be a time when ol’Instagram just fills up with a bunch of marriage proposal pictures. And I was so tickled thisyear to see two of my dude friends proposed to by their ladies. And they both said Yes and itwas so cute. And I asked Ben if he had heard any crazy engagement stories at the UCLA 21marriage lab because, you figure, tons of ‘em. And he said, “Nnhhh…” Because of scientificconfidentiality, he couldn’t tell me!So I asked the internet and found stories online of folks who proposed these ways: Asking 48friends to dress up in carrot costumes and chant, “Marry him” in unison. There was a zerogravity proposal on a vomit comet plane. So hopefully no onlookers were just kinda “barf”from the sentimentality of it. A professional stunt person lit himself on fire, safely. But still…And then the worst proposals, the ones I couldn’t ever even dream up, involved, ([whispered]oh my god,) partners faking their own deaths and then having their beloveds called to thescene of this fake motorcycle or pedestrian crash, and then springing up, alive, with a ring, onone knee.And yes, more than one asshole on planet Earth thought this was charming and cute to makehis future spouse grieve above his fake blood-smeared body before just asking for her hand.They go from crying, to awkwardly really angry, to crying again. It’s just too much of awhirlwind. It’s too much for the human nervous system. But that being said, I do cry at everywedding I attend. All of ‘em.Alie: Do you cry at weddings?Ben: I cried at my wedding.Alie: You did? Aww, that’s great! That’s a good sign, right?Ben: I did. I was crying with joy, and gratitude, and just emotion because I was very, very gratefuland I’m grateful today. I’m very, very… I feel very, very lucky that I’ve found someone who Ithink is an incredible person and I’m grateful every day.Alie: How did you propose?Ben: I proposed privately in her house.Alie: No Jumbotron? [laughs]Ben: There was no Jumbotron. There was no flash mob. I had given the matter a great deal ofthought. I felt like, you know, as a scholar of marriage, I had to make a good case because wewere already together. We were already having a good relationship and I had to say, “I nowhave to… I don’t want to… I’m not trying to convince you because I’m not in the convincingbusiness, but here’s why I think we should do this, and why I’m dying to do it. I want to do itso bad.”Alie: Emma Fiori, first-time question-asker: What do you think the essential things a couple mustknow about each other before getting married?Ben: I think that… of course, more is better. It’s good to know about your partner. But the mostimportant thing you need to know about your partner is how you and your partner interacttogether. And I would actually say that the most important thing is how you managedifference. It’s easy to get along on the things you care about the same. It’s easy to get alongon a cruise ship with a cocktail, right? As we’ve already covered. So in terms of the future ofthe relationship, what you want to know is, “How do we disagree? Are you able tocompromise?” What you want to know about your partner is: Is your partner capable ofempathy? [crowd: “Aaoooh.”] That’s what you want to know.In other words, the most important thing to know about your partner is how your partnerengages in the process of intimacy with you. It’s not about your partner’s sexual history, it’snot about your partner’s score on a personality scale. It’s not about whether your partner 22likes Chinese food, or opera, or ball games. None of that is the most important thing. Toanswer your question, Emma, is: What you want to know about your partner is, how doesyour partner do intimacy? And the fundamental part where intimacy is tested is in difference,and you will be tested because you are different from your partner. Everyone is differentfrom everyone. So how does your partner manage difference with you, and how do you feel inthose moments? That’s the most important thing you can know.Alie: Empathy. That’s such a good point. I mean, that’s such a good point. That’s such afundamental thing. Liz Tong, also a first-time question-asker: Why does everyone say the firstyear of marriage is the hardest? Do you find that that’s true in studying newlyweddevelopment?Ben: Yes. It’s hard because circumstances tend to be hard. So the transition into marriage involveschallenges that, once they’re overcome, sort of fade away. So what are those challenges? A lotof times it involves some kind of move. Moving is always stressful. A lot of people get marriedlike, “Oh, we both got jobs in the same city, so we’re going to get married, and we’re going tomove into the same place”, or “We’re both graduating from college or grad school and sowe’re getting married and moving into the same place.”So that first year, you’re not just getting married, not only are you often planning a wedding,but you’ve got other transitions. So the first year often has other transitions in it that make itchallenging. That’s one. Number two, when people get married, they’re not just merging twopeople, they’re merging two big social networks and especially their families.We haven’t talked about in-laws, but in-laws are a big issue. So a lot of times when people getmarried that first year is where you suddenly think, “Oh wait a minute, where are we going tospend Thanksgiving? Where are we going to spend Christmas? Whose family?” So there’sthings to negotiate in that first year that some couples have never negotiated. When couplesget married, they often will, to some degree, merge finances. And so now they’ve got to haveconversations about finances that perhaps they didn’t have before.So there’s all sorts of new issues raised by getting married that have to be addressed for thefirst time during the first year, and that’s what makes the first year challenging. What we seeis newlyweds tend to be very happy and then it tends to decline. It doesn’t necessarilybecome unhappy, but it declines from its peak. And the biggest declines are early on. Andthen couples sort of find their level, and many couples still find a very high level. It’s greatthat newlyweds are as happy as they are because that happiness helps them through thoseinevitable challenges of that first year of transition.Alie: And then if you are, maybe, in a little bit of a slump, say you’ve been married for a while, tryto find new experiences together.Ben: New ways of connecting. Yes. New ways to discover your partner and to discover thecapabilities of yourself as a couple. Now again, that’s kind of a bourgeois piece of advicebecause it implies all sorts of flexibility that many people do not have, which is why, for manypeople, marriage is hard. It’s hard to keep it fresh and exciting. But if you are privileged andyou have the capability, remembering to invest in your marriage, remembering to nurturethat connection is a very important thing.Alie: And how do you feel about movie tropes where at the end there’s a marriage? Or are thereany movies about marriage that you think are really valuable for people to watch?23Aside: There was a study conducted by some friends of Ben at the University of Rochesterand Ron Rogge was the lead author on this study, which had 174 couples watch romanticmovies and then talk about them after. This sounds like a genius, cunning plan, right?Ben: The interesting thing about that study is… What they did was they tested three differentkinds of marital interventions; one that focused on conflict resolution skills, one that focusedon social support skills like, “How do you support each other?” And the third one was just atrivial intervention that they made up. And they said, “You know what, for the third one, justas a comparison group, we’ll just make up the stupidest intervention we can. And what we’lldo is we’ll just say, ‘Oh, here’s a list of romance movies. Just watch them and talk about them.We’re not going to give you any other advice’.” Whereas the other two interventions, theygave people a lot of advice: “Here’s how to deal with conflict. Here’s how to do socialsupport...” Hours and hours of advice. The third one was this silly one and it worked just aswell as the other two.Aside: The result: the divorce rate for those couples was cut in half. So, I dunno, watchmovies and just talk about ‘em, ya love birds. Now, are there any romance movies that helikes?Ben: Well, there’s a movie called The Five-Year Engagement with Emily Blunt and Jason Segel, andthe director of that movie, as he was making it, came to our lab and hung out, and we talkedto him a little bit and he got to see... And so in the movie, the Emily Blunt character is a socialpsychologist, so she has a lab. She goes to her lab meeting. She’s a grad student in socialpsychology, she goes to a lab meeting, and he wanted to see what an actual lab meeting waslike so he sat in. So I liked that film. It was pretty fun.Alie: Oh, that’s good to know. I’ve never had an ologist who’s had a personal connection like that.Ben: Well, it’s fun to be in LA because when Hollywood wants relationship scientists, theyoccasionally give us a call because we’re local. Not because we’re the greatest, but becausewe’re lucky enough. This was just another example of luck.Alie: What do you hate the most about partnership? About your work? About marriage? What isthe shittiest thing about the institution of partnership or studying it?Ben: The shittiest thing about marriage or about studying marriage? It’s a tough question.Generally speaking, I am pro-marriage when it’s good. The shittiest thing about marriage isthat it occasionally traps people in bad relationships, and that’s super shitty. Like, the worstthing about the institution is that it can be a trap.There are privileges that we associate with marriage because we privilege marriage overother relationships legally, and there’s lots of evidence that that’s true, but it means that thereare people… And the shittiest thing about marriage is that for a lot of its history, it’s been apretty oppressive institution for women. And in lots of parts of the world, it still is, wherewomen are treated as property of their husbands. The fact that for so long, men who aremarried to their wives had a right to sexually molest their wives and abuse their wives. Thefact that still to this day, you know, a ton of abuse happens in secret in marriage. So I mean,seriously, the shittiest things about marriage are incredibly bad, are fatal, and especially towomen.Aside: Obviously, marriage is different in so many parts of the world, and because Benstudies essentially Westernized thoughts on marriage and intimacy, we focused on that. Still,in so many countries, marriage law contradicts basic international human rights laws withwives needing permission from husbands to work a job or sign legal documents. Even in the 241970s, in France, and Spain, and America, husbands had to give permission for things likeapplying for credit cards, or a business loan, or just a woman’s right to leave the house alone.This aside gets even harder to hear, so a little warning for the next minute or so. In the 1800shere in the US, husbands were entitled to ‘domestic discipline’ of their wives. And judgeswere fine with it just as long as the whip or stick they used to beat their wives was no widerthan a judge’s thumb. This was called ‘the rule of thumb’.Now in some countries, it’s still legal and acceptable for a husband to use violence todiscipline his partner. A UNICEF study showed that large percentages of women inAfghanistan, Jordan, Mali, Laos, have been socialized to agree that a husband is justified inbeating his wife if she argues or goes out without asking him. And of course, there arepractices like child marriages and other brutalities. Women and girls are forced to marrytheir sexual abusers to save their reputations.So while one person’s associations of marriage might be just Pinterest wedding boards ofrustic mason-jar cocktails, another’s association could be financial tension or deepcommitments to not only a partner but to a shared religion, or the celebration of having theirlove finally legally recognized, or trying to change the expectations of both partners to aunion that is more balanced and safe. Ben continues…Ben: I’d like to believe that as a society we are moving away from that, maybe not quickly enough,but still substantially so that more and more people believe that marriage should be aninstitution of equality, where both partners are treated as independent human beings whoare choosing to connect to each other, but neither one is property of the other. I do think thatmany people would describe their marriages that way and try to live that way, but it’s nottrue for everyone, and that is a bad thing. As far as the worst things about studying marriage,that’d be much harder because it’s a privilege to study marriage. I am super lucky.The theme of this conversation is that I just feel fortunate, like the luckiest guy in the worldthat I get to do this. That I get to think about and talk to people like you about something thatI care about and that everybody cares about. I don’t have to convince anybody. “What do youstudy? Marriage? Ah, that doesn’t matter. Why would you do that?” No. Everyone cares!People really care about marriage. I’m not studying, you know, some weird thing I have toeven define, that you didn’t even know exists. Everyone knows that relationships matter.Everyone’s thinking about them. They’re surrounded by them. And I could do that for aliving!?! That’s only good.Alie: You get to study other people’s distractions. Other people’s distractions are your focus.Ben: Yes, it’s true. Well, again, I don’t think that relationships are a distraction. I think that’s wheremost people live, and work is a distraction.Alie: Oh, right. That’s a great point.Ben: For many people, their work is a distraction. What they care about is their family. They careabout their love. They care about the connection. “I want to get back to the couch where I cancuddle with the person that I’m closest to.” Work is a means to that end.Alie: We just exposed a fundamental flaw in my whole paradigm. [laughs]Ben: [laughs] “Oh wait, I thought relationships were a distraction?” I don’t think they are. Life iscomplicated and people can care about… I also love my job. I do. I love my job, but I wouldn’tpick it over my relationship.25Aside: Please picture me right now with those black-and-white hypnosis spirals for eyesfalling down a thought chasm reflecting on my life. Okay, let’s move on.Alie: And what is your favorite thing about relationships? Your work? Marriage? Best thing?Ben: The best thing about my job is that I get to ask the questions that occur to me and somehow Ihave the freedom and flexibility to pursue them in any way that I want. It’s, again, anincredible privilege that I feel grateful for every day. The best thing about intimacy is that itsolves sort of an existential problem, which is that each of us is alone.The truth is, I can’t escape my own skin; fundamentally there’s a separation between me andthe rest of the world that ends at my epidermis. But intimacy is a way of emotionally bridgingthe gap of connecting, of being not just in my own head, but somehow connecting through ourskin to somebody else and even across space with somebody else. And that’s a miracle, andit’s kind of a miracle that it exists, but that we’ve evolved to have that happen. That right now,there’s people in the world that I’m connected to, that I can feel. I mean, not in a supernaturalway, but that they matter to me right now even as I’m sitting in a room far away from them.And that’s an incredible metaphysical miracle.Alie: It’s a little magic.Ben: It’s a little bit magical and I believe that a lot of the natural and material world is magical. Notbecause it’s supernatural, but because the natural world is pretty amazing.Alie: Where can people find you? Where can they read your words and see your studies?Ben: They can find me at UCLA. They can google my name, Benjamin Karney. Our lab is the UCLAMarriage Lab, and that’s also googleable, and we have a website where a lot of our work ispublished.Alie: Cool. And for every episode I donate to a particular charity or nonprofit that’s related to yourfield.Ben: I would be delighted to do that. And there are a lot of charities that I think help victims ofabuse escape bad relationships, and I would love to be able to support them.Alie: Okay, great. Well good. Oh, well thank you so much for doing this.Ben: My pleasure, Alie.Alie: Oh, I love this.The host, Dan Cummins, deep dives intotopics like Shadow People, and Ted Bundy, and Stalin, and Scientology, Vlad the Impaler, really darkhumor and intense research. I have learned so much history from this podcast! This week Danexamines the McNeil treatment center, aka Pedophile Island. What do you do with high-risk sexoffenders? So, listen to Timesuck wherever you listen to podcasts. TimesuckPodcast.com. I think youwill like it.Oh, heeeeeey! It's your old roommate who always subscribed to magazines that you read but were tooembarrassed to buy, Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. Okay, so please imagine meright now; I am wearing a Sherlock Holmes flappy wool overcoat that smells like a wet dog in the rain.Also, I have a walrus mustache and a decorative pipe because we’re about to investigate the mysteriesof the psyche. What makes you, you? Who are you? Who am I? Why are we like this?First, let's show some goddamn gratitude for one second and say thank you to everyone on Patreonwho supports the show for a dollar or more a month, also all the folks getting Ologies merch atOlogiesMerch.com. And all the nice people who hit subscribe, and who rate the show, and leavereviews like a friendliness fairy in the night for me to read. For example, this week from Lalajuju[phonetic] who says:I love Alie Ward.Thank you, Lalajuju. I love you too.I also love science, and learning. When I heard about this, it was better than I could haveimagined. I can learn about different Ologies while I am at work or getting ready for work. Oncemy eleven-year-old daughter got wind of this podcast, from me, she started listening too. I nevertold her to! She just listened on her own.So Lalajuju, thank you for sharing the gift of Ologies with your 11-year-old. I am very sorry that I amteaching her how to swear.Okay. Onward, Ward. Personality psychology. I really wish that there was a weirder, documentedname for this -ology, and for a second I thought the academic study of ‘Personology’ could apply. I waslike, “Yes!!” But the guy that coined personology, Henry Murray, essentially peed on the word to makeit his forever. And he had a really heavy hand in founding the study of personality - that's great - buthe's also noted as having done some hella sketchy, and maybe damaging, experiments on a young mannamed Ted Kaczynski, who later became a terrorist known as The Unabomber. Dr Murray, also linkedto government mind control experiments, MKUltra, not to be confused with Michelob Ultra. So mypoint is, Personology was off the table for this episode title. We had to go with the clunkier, wellrespected, and academically recognized Personality Psychology.2So this Ologist had been on my list for months, and one chilly December day, I made my way to UCDavis to meet her on a corner near campus and I drove by one minute late, and I screamed out thewindow, "Hold on! I have to park!" thinking it would take one second to park because school wasn'teven in session, it was December 26th. But the city was under construction so I had to circle the block,maybe 52 times, and then I was 7 minutes late to the corner. I felt like a very bad, not conscientiousperson, but she was so cool about it. We walked to her office, where she is a Professor in theDepartment of Psychology. She's also been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the BehavioralSciences at Stanford University, and her focus is on people's own awareness of their personalities andhow personality and relationships influence your life and make it suck more or less.She's coauthored papers with titles like, "Others Sometimes Know Us Better Than We KnowOurselves" and this salty goodness, "You Probably Think Paper's About You: Narcissists’ Perception ofTheir Personality And Reputation." She studies all the stuff that if you were sitting next to her on anairplane, you'd be like, "Tell me everything before this flight to Japan lands!" So, we chatted about firstimpressions, introverts, extroverts, ambiverts, narcissists, psychopaths, whether or not psychologyresearchers believe self-reported data, how parenting affects personalities, and if you're screwingyour kids up, what personalities work best together, if astrology is in any way on point, sometextbooks you'd actually want to read, and I essentially asked her ten different ways, [echoing] "Whyam I this?"So get comfy, and gaze into your brain with someone I wish I could call a personologist, but thatMurray dude made it awkward for everybody so instead we'll just use the more common andscientifically acceptable Personality Psychologist, Dr. Simine Vazire.----------Dr. Simine Vazire: Simine Vazire.Alie Ward: Mm-hmm. Doctor? [both laugh]Simine: I tell my students to call me by my first name, so anything’s fine.Alie: Really? Are they uncomfortable with it at first, like it's not reverent?Simine: Some of them are, yeah. But I find that, well, because of my personality, I think I have toworry more about not being approachable enough rather than being too casual or nothaving enough boundaries. For different people different things work, but for me, asking…they don't have to call me by my first name, but telling them they can reduces that distancea little bit, which tends to be the bigger challenge for me.Alie: And you said, ‘because of your personality,’ which gets us right into your work becauseyou study not only personality psychology, but also people's own awareness andknowledge of their own personality, so you seem to know yours pretty well.Simine: I know some aspects of mine. I’m sure that I have blind spots too. We have this expressionin academia called ‘me-search,’ which is where you study like what you're bad at. So Ithink I’m probably overall average on self-knowledge, but I now I have some blind spotsfor sure.Alie: What did you start to notice about your personality when you got into this work?3Simine: I think I was really fascinated by the differences between how people see themselves andhow others see them. And I think it’s really rare that we find out how other people see us. Iremember at the end of high school, one of my friends wrote in my yearbook, "I alwaysadmired you because you don't care what people think." And I was like, "What do peoplethink?" [both laugh]So I had no idea that I came across as not caring what people thought. And I was like,"Well, maybe I care less than other people." I experience myself as caring a LOT what otherpeople think.Alie: Right!Simine: But then I realized, well, I don't wear makeup, I don't put a lot of thought into my clothing,so if I really cared what people think maybe I would've been doing those things. So then Iwas like, "Oh. Maybe relative to other people I actually do care less what people think."But, like, yearbooks are one of the rare places where people sometimes tell you a little bitabout what they think of you.My best friend and I in high school and I used to write each other notes, we shared alocker, we would leave each other notes in our locker. And she wrote me a notesophomore year of high school, and it said, "You asked me at the party on Saturday what Ithought of your personality, and so I wanted to tell you what I think of your personality."And she's like, "You're a nine out of ten, but don't worry, you wouldn't want to be a ten outof ten because those people are annoying." And it was just really funny that, apparently,when I was 14 or 15 years old, I was asking my best friend what she thought of mypersonality, it was crazy!Alie: You were doing personality research in your locker!Simine: Yeah, yeah, it's so funny. It was so funny when I found that.Alie: Did she say what that docked point was for?Simine: No, I don't know. She went on to tell me more specific things, ‘cause like, nine out of tendoesn't really mean anything. But I don't remember now. I actually took a picture of it andhave a PDF so that I don't ever lose it. It would be interesting to go back and look, but Idon't remember what the specific criticisms were. There were some. They weren't meanor anything.Aside: I sent Simine a note to ask if she ever found that PDF, and she emailed me rightback with the PDF itself! Oh! What a time capsule of vulnerability! I love her! So of course, Iread it. Here are some of the things that her friend, Geraline, [ph.] hand wrote on agreeting card that was a 1995 dot matrix picture of a turkey. So, an excerpt:I think you are very good at understanding people, but sometimes a little too harsh inyour judgment. You're spirited, you motivate people, and you are a good sport aboutthings. You're trustworthy and honest. One important quality, your morals arewonderful! Another great thing I like about you, you're always learning about yourselfand growing. Your influence and friendship is part of what makes me, me, and I have tothank you because I like myself. And your friendship has meant a lot to me over the years.4Ah! Not only is this an honest and sweet-ass letter from a best friend, but how precious tosee that personality psychology and how people see themselves is something that Siminehas been low-key researching since the dot matrix days!Also, this prompted me to look back at some old school papers, and I found an oldyearbook of mine with inscriptions that were like, "You're weird, but fun I guess." And onefrom a guy named Erik in my science class who, in the fashion of middle managementinscribed, "Here's a piece of advice. Try to calm down. You always seem to be going in fastforward." Okay. So, nothing's changed.Alie: Oh my God! I think that that's something that so many people want to know, how doothers see them versus how they see themselves and... Did you grow up, you know, earlierthan high school thinking about this, or was it really when you started to get around peersand go through adolescence that you started thinking about it?Simine: Yeah, that’s a good question... [“Thank you”] I mean, I grew up pretty close to my brother,we were one year apart in school, so I think I always looked at the differences betweenhim and me, and within our families we had, kind of, different roles and personalities. Nowthat we are adults I see that we are actually really, really similar compared to the broaderpopulation. But yeah, it was always interesting to me, like, the things that he was scared ofand I wasn't, or vice versa. So, I think it was on my radar earlier on but I think it becomesreally relevant when you have friend groups, and who doesn't get invited to the party, andwhy, and you know, what do people think of you, what's your role in your friend group,and all that.Alie: When did you start steering your career that way?Simine: I took a personality psych class and had a really good teacher and a really good textbook,so I think it was that class in particular that got me into it. Yeah.Alie: Did you ever take those personality quizzes in magazines or... ?Simine: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.Alie: Is there any merit to those at all?Simine: Probably not. Or if there is, it's probably by accident. It's actually not that hard to write avalid personality quiz. The ones that don't seem completely ridiculous probably actuallydo have merit, so if it's a test of your extroversion and it asks if you like to go to parties, ifyou like to hang out with people, that's probably pretty valid. But if it's a test of yourextroversion and it asks if you like Bernese mountain dogs or chihuahuas, [Alie laughs]that's probably not a valid measurement of your extroversion.Alie: That is what we call bullshit, rather.Aside: If you wanted to take a bullshit quiz, ooh.. oh there's plenty waiting for you.Such as, BuzzFeed’s: What type of sandwich are you? Which ‘90s cartoon series are you?What piece of IKEA furniture are you? Or Livingly's: Your choice in late night snacks willreveal your dominant personality type. Or, which Meghan Markle are you? Zimbio has anAre you a Robin William's Genie, or a Will Smith Genie? And finally, BuzzFeed’s Which 5BuzzFeed quiz are you? So, how does Simine's methodology differ from these incitefulsurveys?Alie: And so, when you're doing research on personalities, what does that involve? Are youasking people about their own personalities, or are you grabbing their best friend andasking, "What's their deal?" Like, how are you getting the data?Simine: Yeah, it's all of the above. So, we try to get every measurement we can think of becausenone of them is a direct pipeline, right? There's no pure measure of someone's personality,so we ask them what they're like, we give them a questionnaire with dozens, or sometimeshundreds, of questions about their personality. And then we give a similar questionnaireto their friends or family members, whoever they let us contact, and ask those people todescribe the person on the same kind of questionnaire. We also try to get somethingindependent of both them and their friends or family so that we can try to gauge who'sright, or who's more accurate. [Alie laughs]And that's a challenge, ‘cause those are the two easiest methods, right, asking people to fillout questionnaires is easier than almost anything else. So the challenge with getting a thirdmeasure, something other than self and friends, we try to get actual behavior. We want toobserve what people are like, but the trick with that is if you bring people into the lab andobserve their behavior that might not be what they're really like.Aside: I keep picturing myself stiffly walking in, trying to conceal a mustard stain onmy scarf, wearing an expression of desperation to blend in. [computer voice, "Hello. I amhealthy and normal.”]Simine: So, we try to do it in a naturalistic way, get people in their everyday lives, so we have thisaudio recorder that our participants agree to wear if they're willing to. And it's really justan iPod Touch, but we program it so that the audio recording aspect of it comes on and off,and so they just clip it to the outside of their clothes or their bag and they wear it for, forexample, a week, and it comes on and off, and they don't know exactly when it's on or off.And then when they turn it in we tell them, "We're going to give you a disc with all thefiles. You can delete any files, or tell us which files to delete, you know. Actually, peopleend up being fine with leaving all of them on. But we want to make sure that they're reallyokay with it. We give them a lot of opportunities.Aside: I had done some research of Simine's work ahead of time, and I was so excitedshe brought this up right away. So these devices are called EARs. It stands forElectronically Activated Recorder. Which is very cute. Technically, that's called abackronym, when something that stands for something else is cute on purpose.So, the most common capture pattern they do is recording for 30 seconds every 12minutes. Then the volunteers fill out an hourly report of what they were up to. They alsowear a button that says, essentially, "Hey! Someone might be recording this and listeningto this, so let me know if that freaks you the fuck out or whatever."Also, this made me wonder, aren't our phones just always eavesdropping all the timeanyway? Just ready to sell us something we casually mentioned in a conversation? Well, a 6study from Northwestern University came out last year that tracked over 17,000 apps tosee if they were recording our conversations about, like, vegan marshmallows andplatform sneakers. And the researchers, well, they didn't say no. They just said that they‘couldn't find evidence’ of the activities taking place. So it's not not listening to you.Anyway, some personality psychologists recording conversations to untangle themysteries of the human mind-- pretty benign. It's not like the UC Davis research teamincludes old Zuckerberg at his laptop sending you coupons for off-brand Invisalign, orgeometric sloth necklaces, which is what my Instagram just tried to sell me -- which wasspot-on, though. It's pretty good. Well played, Big Brother.Simine: So it's about 5% of the time that it's on.Alie: Just random snippets of your life.Simine: Yes. So, 30 seconds turns out to be long enough that we can figure out; are you socializing?Are you working? Are you watching TV? And if you're socializing; is it a group of people?Or is it one-on-one? Is it a deep conversation? Or is it superficial? So we can tell a lot aboutwhat people are doing, just the behaviors and also the psychological context that they'rein. It turns out, a 30-second clip gives you quite a bit of information about what people areup to without violating their privacy too much. [laughs]Alie: [laughs] And then, so you take all those files and you figure out, "Okay. This is how oftenthe person was around other people, or talking to other people, this is how much theywere alone, this is how much they were using, maybe, violent or sexual language, so youcan kinda categorize and interpret the data that way?Simine: Yeah. So for example, from the questionnaires, if you said you are not very funny but yourfriend said you're really funny, then we can listen to the sound files and have a group ofcoders who are relatively neutral and objective, who don't know you, they can rate howfunny you were in your conversations, and then we can say who is more accurate, you oryour friends.Alie: Wow! [“You're so funny!”]Alie: And now, what are you studying when you're looking at this data? Do you do, maybe, onestudy on extroversion and one on narcissism, or… What are you looking for?Simine: Yeah, that's a really good question. Because it’s so hard to collect these data, we measureeverything we can think of.Aside: A bunch of people, too many to name, asked what tests they use, and boom!Here it is. In five, four, three, two, one…Simine: So, we use a model called The Big Five, which is a model of personality that says there'sfive, kind of, broad dimensions along which people differ. For example, one of them isextroversion, and in each of those five categories there's specific traits. In the extroversioncategory there's how sociable the person is, how talkative they are, how assertive they are,so there's like more specific personality traits in each of the five categories. It's not thatthere's only five personality traits, but there's five, kind of, clusters of personality traits. 7So we measure those, and then we also throw in other things that we think aren't reallywell captured by the Big Five. Narcissism is one example of something that we thinkdoesn't fall neatly into one of those five categories. So we measure, you know, a handful ofother traits beyond the Big Five as well.Aside: So, real quick, what is the Big Five? It's a bunch of questions, it takes maybeeight minutes to complete, it measures essentially what your deal is. It's also called thevery unspicy name, Five Factors Model, or the exciting acronym OCEAN, because thesefactors are measured: Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extroversion,Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. So you can flip those words around and make it spellCANOE if you are more of an inland-lakes rather than an open sea kind of person. [bigsplashing]Simine: Our research isn't really about one specific personality trait. What we really want to knowis how accurate people are at describing themselves in general. So we might, you know,look at how accurate they are about how funny they are but actually we are interested inalso how accurate they are about how extroverted they are, and how narcissistic they are,and everything else.Alie: What do you think is a trait that tends to get misreported the most?Simine: So, I don't have a lot of evidence for this, but my intuition, my hunch… And we're startingto collect data on this and have some evidence for, but I could be wrong. My hunch is thatwe're not very good at judging our own, what in personality psychology we call,"agreeableness," which is basically how polite, and kind, and considerate you are. [clipfrom movie, "I'm so sorry!” “No, I'm sorry!"]And that all sounds like a good thing, and everybody wants to be really agreeable, butactually it can be taken too far. People who are too agreeable are, kind of, doormats, theywon't stick up for people they care about, or things they believe in, things like that. So Idon't want to paint it as only good things. Like most personality traits there's good andbad components to it, or it can backfire in some situations. But I think it's a dimension thatwe're really bad at judging in ourselves, or at least that's my intuition.Alie: Do you think that we think we're more agreeable than we are?Simine: I think some people think they’re more agreeable than they are, and some people thinkthey're less agreeable than they are. [both laughing] And it probably has a lot to do withself-esteem. Like with many personality traits, to the extent that we're biased, thedirection of our bias reflects our self-esteem. So, some people overestimate themselves,other people underestimate themselves, and that's going to predict the direction of theirbias, whether we're talking about agreeableness, or extroversion, or intelligence, oranything else.Aside: So yes, researchers can't always trust self-reporting because depending onhow we feel about ourselves, we might be a little off. And, side note, I started to wonder,what is self-esteem? I never quite understood the line between confidence and arrogance,where does that lie? So I did some digging, and I happened upon an article by the 8psychiatrist and author Dr. Neel Burton, who broke it down as: Self-confidence comesfrom the root word for trust, and self-confidence means to trust yourself, and to trust yourabilities, but self-esteem is to understand your worth, so you can be confident that you canget shit done, while still feeling unworthy. You can rack up degrees, and be able to buy abig house, and have a ton of followers, and money, and be confident, but still feel like theworld is out to get you, and doesn't have your best interest in mind, and you have nocontrol, and you suck. So, arrogance steps in to fill in the gaps where there’s not enoughtrue self-esteem. And arrogance can be a symptom that someone is really thirsty forapproval from the outside.So, self-esteem, good. Where we gets this? Well, Dr. Neel Burton wrote this passage aboutwhere self-esteem comes from, which, for a Psychology Today blog post, was oddlyprofound and really beautiful. So I am going to run some royalty-free, relaxing musicunderneath, and that way you can just feel free to replay this as many times as you need.[calm, serene music plays in the background]It's no good trying to pump up the self-esteem of children, and increasingly, adults, withempty and condescending praise. Whenever we live up to our dreams and promises, wecan feel ourselves growing. Whenever we fail, but know that we have given our best, wecan feel ourselves growing. Whenever we stand up for our values and face theconsequences, we can feel ourselves growing. Whenever we come to terms with a difficulttruth, we can feel ourselves growing. Whenever we bravely live up to our ideals, we canfeel ourselves growing. That is what growth depends on. Growth depends on bravelyliving up to our ideals, not on the ideals of the bank that we work for, or our parents’praise, or our children's successes, or anything else that is not truly our own.Whew! So if you struggle with self-esteem, or maybe you feel like you have to puff thingsup and fake it, you're not alone. A lot of people struggle with self-esteem. But self-esteemdoesn't rely on perfection, it doesn't require anything outside of you, but simply anappreciation for the unique little monkey that you are, trying its best. So, holy shit! I thinkthis episode already fixed my whole life!Okay. But let's backtrack to personality tests, since that was a question that I got so much.Alie: You mentioned the big five and, one question that I got the most, so much from patronsthat I... it's too many to even ask and it's such a big question is: What do you think aboutpersonality evaluations like Myers–Briggs, and enneagrams, and Big Five. What do youthink is bullshit, what's not?Simine: There's a lot of really good, valid measures that are free, so probably if you are paying forsomething you're getting screwed. [both laugh]Simine: That's my kind of, general... I mean I think there might be some contexts where it's worthpaying for a personality test that costs money, but there are so many good ones that arefree that it’s hard for me to imagine why someone would charge you for a personality testwhen you could find a free good one online. So if you Google ‘big five’ or ‘five factorpersonality tests,’ you can find lots of free versions that will give you feedback. And those 9are pretty valid… I'm sure they're some that aren't, but there are plenty of really good,valid, Big Five measures.Or there's another model of personality called the HEXACO, which is a six-factor modelthat's also quite scientifically valid. There's a little bit of a debate in academic psychologyabout five factors versus six factors, but I think both of those are quite valid. MeyersBriggs, I mean, it doesn't have zero validity, but it's much, much worse than the Big Five,and it costs money, so there's really no reason to ever use the Meyers-Briggs. And itsvalidity is quite poor, I would say. Again, it's not zero, it's not complete bullshit, but it'salmost complete bullshit. [both laugh]Alie: Bullshit adjacent.Simine: Yeah. [laughs]Aside: Meyers-Briggs -- officially on blast. [DJ airhorn] Enneagrams, by the way,outline nine personality types, and ‘ennea’ means ‘nine’ in Greek. This not to be confusedwith Bananagrams, which is a word game like Scrabble, but you don't need a board, and allthe tiles come in a banana-shaped pouch, which was invented by a 76-year-old guy fromPawtucket, Rhode Island. Anyway, Meyers-Briggs and the enneagram tests: not necessarywhen you have the Big Five.Simine: I don't judge people for finding those things fun or interesting, and I think we can learnsomething even from bullshit tests. I think, you know, if I take a test about, "What dogbreed would you be?" I can sometimes, because of taking that test and reading thefeedback, I'll end up reflecting and learning something about myself, not because the testis valid, but just because of the activity of reflecting on it.So, I don't begrudge anyone for wanting to take those tests or enjoying them. I just think, ifyou're spending money on it, or you're putting a lot of weight on it, or making importantlife decisions because you think it's scientifically valid, I wouldn't do that. But if you find ituseful, and entertaining, and maybe even it leads to self-reflection and self-insight, that'sgreatAside: So, side note, I did take a "What breed of dog are you?" test, thank you verymuch, and it said... St. Bernard. Because I'm hard working and courageous. And then I waslike, "Ooh, that went well." So I took another one. And it said chihuahua. Which "Has a lotof haters, but not to let it get me down." So then I stared into the distance in a trance ofself-reflection and insight, which is exactly what the test was supposed to do.Alie: Have you gotten really good at being able to tell someone's Big Five just, pretty quickly,like at a cocktail party?Simine: I think we all are, actually. I think it's like, a natural human tendency. So, some of the BigFive are easier to tell than others. Extroversion’s really easy to tell, actually even from astill photograph of someone, you can judge better than chance. You could too.Alie: What!!!10Simine: Yeah. It doesn't take any special skill. Like, we looked at just, you know, undergraduates,we showed them photos of people whose extroversion level we knew from valid,measured tests, and they were better than chance at judging extroversion. Actually, samewith narcissism. From a still photo, you can judge narcissism better than chance. Notperfectly, far from perfectly, but better than chance. So if you meet somebody, within fiveminutes you would know their extroversion level quite well.Alie: Really?Simine: Some other personality characteristics are relatively easy to judge, depending on thecontext. So if you see their office, or their home environment, you could judge theirconscientiousness pretty well, because conscientiousness has a lot to do with how tidy andorganized and orderly their life is, although I'm an example of when one facet of the BigFive domain… For conscientiousness, one facet is neatness, and I'm really low onneatness, you might be able to tell. My office is quite messy. [long drawn out, “naw”]Aside: Her office was fine! There were some papers, a few books on the desk, but it's adesk! A desk's job is to be a horizontal service on which you pile your business shit!Simine: But I'm high on most of the other facets of conscientiousness, so sometimes you might bemisled if you just see one facet, or someone might be really assertive and so you think theyare really extroverted, but actually when you see them in a social situation they're not thattalkative and not that social. It's just the assertiveness that they are really high on. Sosometimes you could be led astray by one strong trait when actually they're pretty low onthe other traits in that cluster.But, yeah, you can judge conscientiousness pretty easily if you see how organized and selfdisciplined they are. But actually agreeableness is one of the harder ones to judge becausealmost everybody tends to be pretty polite and kind in a new... like when they’re meetingwith someone new. It takes a while before the disagreeableness comes out in disagreeablepeople, so that one is a little bit harder to judge. And neuroticism is also harder to judge, sothat's their tendency to experience negative emotion. Most people don't wear that on theirsleeve. You have to get to know them pretty well to know if they're the kind of person whogets sad, or angry, or anxious. That kind of thing.Aside: A lot of researchers have found that you can also detect neuroticism just bylistening to a person's podcast and hearing them say neurotic things.Alie: And these are things that we can detect pretty quickly in meeting people? We're justprogrammed to read behaviors?Simine: Yeah. Certainly extroversion, conscientiousness, comes across pretty quickly. I thinkagreeableness and narcissism you can detect once you know someone for a few weeks. Iwould say, you’d probably have a decent idea, and it depends how close you are to them,So like neuroticism, romantic partners are really, really accurate 'cause you see, kind of, allthe emotional ups and downs, but you could be acquaintances with someone for a longtime and not know that they have a tendency towards depression or something like that.So, some things could remain unknown for a long time. 11But many aspects of personality are actually quite easy to judge, and we're all, kind of,experts at it out of necessity. When we go through life, we are trying to judge, would thisperson make a good friend? Would they make a good coworker? Should I agree to go on avacation with this person? All that requires trying to predict their personality, what theywould be like in different situations, and so on. So, by necessity, we all develop the skill todo that.Alie: So if someone is swiping left and right, say, on a dating app, and they don't want to date anextrovert or a narcissist, can you tell? ‘Cause those people are in speedos? Like on a boator something?Simine: That's a good question. So we actually did a study where we looked at, what is it in a photothat correlates with narcissism?Alie: [quietly rooting for] Speedos. Boat. Speedos. Boat. Speedos! Boat! [snippet of sexy, excitingsaxophone solo from Baker Street song]Simine: It's pretty obvious once you know. So for example; wearing expensive clothes, fashionableclothes; for women, wearing a lot makeup, showing cleavage; for men, being muscular, notwearing glasses. So generally, like, being stylish and maybe a little vain would correlatedwith narcissism, and extroversion is part of narcissism. Narcissists tend to be veryextroverted, very expressive, and charming, and things like that. There’s good aspects tothat too, obviously, so they often are quite charming, especially in first impressions, theymake really good first impressions. They may actually be hard to avoid if you are on adating app, they might be the more appealing people when you just have a photo andmaybe a few words about them.Aside: Simine notes that while she studies these personality traits, she doesn't do soat a clinical level, so she's talking about subclinical narcissism, which is just gardenvariety, ‘that dick at the office’ types. Now, is the aim of her work to help people avoid folkswho might not be right for them, or to help us all see ourselves in a way that might lead tohealthier behaviors and relationships?Simine: So yeah, my interest is… like a lot of basic research, I don't exactly know how it's going tohelp people yet. I think that learning what the behavioral patterns are of people high andlow on narcissism, it could help us understand ourselves better, it could help usunderstand each other better, it could help us understand the underlying roots ofnarcissism. For example, I have some research showing that narcissists tend to be quiteimpulsive, which I think speaks to a kind of paradox about narcissists, why do they brag somuch when that might undermine… you know, they're trying to make a good impression,they're trying to impress people, and they're going around telling everyone things that justmake them look like arrogant jerks.And our research suggests - and my former graduate student Ericka Carlson did some ofthis research too - that they kind of know that this is not the best strategy but they can'thelp themselves. So it's not that they are dumb, or that they think they’re being reallystrategic, they just are impulsive and they just can't… they need you to know that they gotthat perfect score on the SAT or whatever.12Alie: And now, I know that the big question in personalities is nature versus nurture. What isDNA, what is ingrained in us, what is hereditary, and what is just a product of ourenvironment? How much of personality is a result of too high of self-esteem or too low ofself-esteem, or the way we were raised? Where is it coming from? [morphed "who arewe??"]Simine: So, the way oversimplified answer is that a lot of it is genetic and isn't how we were raised.Much of it we're born with. Now, ‘much’ is kind of a glass half-empty, glass half-full.There's plenty that's not accounted for by genes. There’s a lot of room left over for otherthings to have influences, but we're having a really hard time pinning down what thoseother influences are. We know that genes don't account for everything. We know thatpersonality changes throughout the lifespan, it's not fixed 100% at birth or anything likethat.There is a genetic component but there's other influences too. It's just very hard to identifywhat they are. It doesn't seem to be straight forward, like if you have an authoritativeparent you're gonna grow up to be more organized. There's nothing quite that simple.Certainly not about parenting. You have to have pretty extremely bad parenting to changeyour child's personality, it turns out.Alie: Really?Simine: Childhood experiences probably do have an impact on personality, but not in a reallystraightforward way where we can say, "If you do this, your child will be more like that,"which is probably disappointing for a lot of parents. Dan Engber wrote a very interestingcolumn in Slate about this, about how it could also be freeing for parents to realize that aslong as you are in the range of a decent parent, then exactly when you potty train your kid,or all of those decisions aren't gonna shape their personality for the rest of their lives.Alie: Yeah, I feel like more and more, too, with the internet, more parents are so worried, like, "Igave him blueberries before the age of 3 and now they're gonna never do theirhomework!” or something.Simine: Yeah, no. Right.Alie: And how do you separate afflictions like anxiety, and depression, and ADHD, prettycommon psychological afflictions, from personality? I feel like my anxiety is who I am a lot,which is...Simine: Yeah, I'm not sure there is a clean separation. I think if you are the kind of person who hasa tendency towards anxiety or depression and it's always there in the background or italways could be there, that's a part of your personality for sure. So I think we could talkabout… and this is true even for extroversion. For example we could talk about whetheryou have a general tendency to be extroverted or whether you were extroverted today, orin the last hour, and we could talk about the same thing with depression, right? You mightnot be depressed right now, but you might have a tendency, or a predisposition towardsdepression, and you know it happens relatively frequently for you. 13We call it a distinction between a trait and a state, or kind of a longer-term pattern versusa short-term, momentary experience. So, some people might not have the long-termpattern of anxiety, but have had one or two episodes of anxiety. They understand what itfeels like but it's not part of their personality. I'm that way, for example, with extroversion,where I am not an extrovert, I am definitely introverted, but I have behaved like anextrovert sometimes. I know what that feels like. I can imagine it. But that doesn't makeme an extrovert, just like having had one episode of depression doesn't make you doesn'tmake you someone with a depressive personality. But both can happen, and you couldhave one without the other.Alie: Why do you think some people are extroverts and some people are introverts? And do youthink people ever force themselves to be something they're not?Simine: I think we can force ourselves to be something we're not in the short-term, like when I’mteaching I try to amp up my extroversion. Interestingly, my students can still tell that I am,by nature, an introvert.Alie: [laughs] I can tell.Simine: Yeah. Actually, I think it's really, really hard to hide. So I can "act like an extrovert," but I’mnot fooling anybody. I’m just behaving in a way that's not consistent with my personalityto fulfill a particular role or something like that, but everyone can still see that it's not mypersonality. It's just a behavior that I am doing.Aside: So what are the signs of an extrovert? A few are: Likes to communicate bytalking; enjoys group work; likes to talk about thoughts, and feelings, and doesn't mindbeing at the center of attention. I am literally forcing her to do all of these things right now,which is very generous and wonderful of her to oblige.Simine: In terms of whether we could actually change in a more long-term way, not just for anhour or two, or a day, or a week, I'm pretty skeptical but I'm kind of an outlier on this. Itend to think that people… that intentional change is really hard and that we're probablybetter off trying to find ways to mitigate our personality or someone else's personalityrather than try to change it. So, if there is something you don't like about yourself or aboutyour partner, I think trying to create an environment where that's not going to be as big ofa problem is a more productive avenue than trying to change it. Changing personality isreally hard. I have a lot of friends who've tried to teach me how to be more extroverted.Alie: Really?Simine: In some cases really extensive, because I wanted to learn that, too. I just don't understandwhy it's so hard for me to talk to strangers, for example. So I remember one year I washaving lunch every day in the same cafeteria and the woman who was serving the foodwas really, really nice to me and I felt terrible that I could never think of questions to askher. She would always ask me questions and I could never think of questions to ask her. SoI practiced with my extroverted friends and I’d be like, "What should I ask her?" Andthey'd give me specific questions and I could repeat those, but I couldn't think of new ones.And we would try to come up with strategies of. “Well, what would you say if it was 14someone you knew well?" or, "What would you say in a situation where you're not feelingshy or whatever?” But I could never apply it in a consistent way. I might be able to one day,but not every day. I couldn't change my dynamic with her. I mean, that's just an anecdote,but I do think it's hard to change. I think extroversion might be harder than some othertraits to change.Alie: It's interesting too, 'cause in children, if a child is shy, we have so much empathy for thechild, but as an adult, if you're shy, it's like, where is that empathy? "Oh! I am just shy!" Youknow? To have it for yourself?Simine: Right, yeah.Alie: And I don't know, it's interesting. I think I'm probably an extrovert, but there are definitelytimes where I feel like I'm forcing myself to be an extrovert, at a dinner party when I feellike the ball's gonna drop and no one's going to talk, so I'm like, “blah blah blah,” youknow? I don't know how much of it is adaptive and... I don't know, but ...Simine: Yeah. I mean, we all have to do things that don't feel, like, completely consistent with ourpersonality sometimes.Alie: How do you think is the best way to objectivity on your own personality? 'Cause I feel likethere’s so much... I don't know, I feel like there is a lot of shame about our personality.Maybe everyone else can see something we can't. You know? How do people get a grip onwho they are? [morphed "Who are we?"]Aside: Just a casual afternoon convo about [squeaky mouse voice “How do we get a gripon who we are?"]Simine: Yeah, that's really hard. There's not much research on this. So this is just, kinda my guess,my intuition. I mean, one possibility would be to ask people who you trust, but I don'tthink they're going to be honest with us. [Alie laughs]And with good reason, right? Like, our relationships kind of depend on not being superblunt with each other about our personalities, so you might have to read between thelines. And I would be careful about putting your friends or family members in that positionof telling you something because it might hurt, and it might hurt damage your relationshipwith them. [clip from Beaches, Bette Midler, “But enough about me, let's talk about you.What do you think of me?"]So I tend not to advocate doing that very much. I think trying to find opportunities toobserve yourself, so recording yourself, or watching videos, or listening to audiorecordings of yourself could be really useful, especially if they're in very realistic context.Not just your answering machine recording, but like, if there was ever a conversation youhad where you weren't self-conscious about being recorded but happened to be recorded,listening to that. I did that… because we use these recorders I wore one for a few days andlistening to myself was fascinating.Alie: Really?15Simine: Well, what was fascinating was that there was nothing on the recording. I would be in allthese conversations where other people were talking, and I would listen to them, and Iwould remember what I was thinking, and so I was like, "Oh, now I am going to say thisthing." And then I wouldn't say it. And I remember that I thought it, and assumed that Iconveyed it somehow, but not, not audibly. [laughs]Alie: Oh, wow!Simine: So it was really good for me because I had always… People had told me that they felt like Ididn't like them or they couldn't tell if I liked them. So I knew on some level that I didn'tconvey when I liked people, but hearing it and hearing how silent I was, I think was reallygood for me, to get a taste of my own medicine, of like, “why aren't I expressing this thingthat I'm feeling?!” That was really useful for me.Aside: So, if screaming "Who even am I?!" into the wind isn't working, you can DIYthis EAR recorder. I looked it up, and the iEAR app they used to use isn't available in theapp store anymore, but there is one made for Android. Just search ‘electronically activatedrecorder,’ EAR for android, and let your personality exploration begin. Also wear a buttonthat warns people, and check your state laws about whether or not it's legal to recordconversations. Okay, bye.Alie: When it comes to different personalities, what do you think, from an evolutionarystandpoint, is happening? Because we work together in groups, do we need a certainbalance?Simine: It could be, yeah. This is so far outside my area of expertise. My best understanding is thatwe don't have a good explanation. That it's kind of a paradox of evolution, like why haven'twe all evolved to have whatever's the optimal personality. And one argument could be,maybe the range of personalities that we see is actually a much narrower band than whatwe might have seen without natural selection. We don't see a lot of psychopaths, we don'tsee a lot of people who are just always disagreeable all the time, right?Like, I'm on the more disagreeable end of the spectrum and I would still like to think thatmost of the time I am agreeable. What distinguishes me from a really agreeable person isthat I'm willing to be disagreeable or I am disagreeable sometimes. But there aren't verymany people who are just always disagreeable, and that might be the result of evolutionand natural selection and those people just selected out.Alie: Yeah! We just cast them away!!Simine: Right! They don't reproduce. [laughs]Alie: [laughs] Banished! “You're a dick!”Aside: When she says that we don't see a lot of psychopaths, she's right... relativelyspeaking. About 1% of people could clinically be considered psychopaths, while 4% areestimated to be sociopaths. We're going to get into more of this later, but back to her workon how we see ourselves. 16Alie: Do you think anyone ever has a big shift in personality after getting medicated fordepression or anxiety or ADHD? Would you say, like... or do you think it just uncovers theirtrue personality to get properly medicated?Simine: That's a good question. There's some research on whether medication or therapy changespersonality, and it looks like on average it does have a small effect, like people do shift alittle bit. Big shifts are really rare, but there are anecdotes or individual cases wherepeople see big shifts after some kind of treatment, or trauma, or something like that. Ithink it's a deep, philosophical question whether that's their true personality coming out,or their personality has actually changed. Was it always there and it just didn't come outbefore? Or did it really change?I think we should study that more often, the rare cases of really dramatic suddenpersonality changes. I mean, and they're hard to study because you don't know whenthey're going to happen, right? It's a really fascinating question.Aside: Okay, so it is a fascinating question, and I asked the internet and it turns outthat yes, getting medicated CAN change your personality, so sayeth some researchers. So,Dr. Brent Roberts, who is a professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois, and hiscolleagues, looked at 144 studies with over 15,000 people and they were using differentkinds of interventions, from talk therapy, and meditation, cognitive behavioral therapyand antidepressants. And it turns out that without trying to change their personality traits,some changed anyway. In particular, patients with anxiety disorders who displayed a lot ofneuroticism changed the most.And then in another study, the professor of Psychology at North Western University, Dr.Tony Z. Tang, found that antidepressants like SSRIs can alter two really key personalitytraits linked to depression, and that's neuroticism and extroversion. So compared toplacebo drugs, just a sugar pill, participants showed a drop in neuroticism, which is thattendency toward emotional instability, and bad moods, and then they had an increase inextroversion, which is a tendency to be more outgoing.In yet another study done by researcher Alie Ward, they looked at one participant takingan antidepressant for anxiety, and found that 100% of the one participant, me, did feel lessanxious and less neurotic after starting medication. [over a phoneline, “So can I call myself adoctor or what? No? Okay.”]Simine: I mean, and even the more subtle changes, like all of us change a little bit as we get olderand have different experiences, there's some pretty good research that suggests thatthings like major role changes, like getting married, or having kids, or entering theworkforce, or becoming a caretaker, things like that really do have an impact on ourpersonalities. It's not a dramatic shift overnight, but they do change our personalities alittle bit. And it's an interesting question, like if you reflect on something that's changedabout yourself over a few decades -- were you a different person back then? Or were youalways like that but you had to grow into it? I think it's a really interesting question. Maybenot even a scientific one. I don't know that there's a scientific answer to that. 17Alie: There's so many cautionary tales of, "Never trust someone who's burned you. They'regoing to do it again.” But do people change over time? You know, if you think about people,maybe who've been incarcerated, who come out of it the other end more conscientiousbecause of discipline or remorse. Do people change?Simine: Yeah, absolutely people do sometimes change. It's just not the norm, I would say. So then, Ithink everyone has to make a decision for themselves about how willing they are to take arisk on someone who may have changed, but probably hasn't, you know? The default isthat people tend to be pretty similar over time but it's too harsh to assume everyonealways will be the same and no one ever changes, so you have to allow for some change.And then I think, it's a really… for me that's a really interesting challenge in life, is howmany second or third chances to give people? And how open should we be to people whoreally want to change even if we know it's unlikely that they'll be able to? Or how muchshould we try to change even if we know it's going to be hard?I think those are really personal questions that, I think, everyone has to decide forthemselves. The evidence is relevant, the evidence suggests that it's hard. We shouldn'texpect change to happen frequently, or easily, or quickly. So, know that and then decidewhat you want to do with that information.Alie: Do you think your work changes who you have close to you in your life, or who you, kindof, give the boot?Simine: It's kind of a chicken and egg problem, I think maybe I study personality because I'vealways been pretty picky about who I have close to me in my life. I think if people close tobe had one complaint about me, I think it would be that I don't... I'm not very optimisticabout people changing, and so sometimes that can be hard on the people close to me. Andalso, I'm pretty stubborn about not wanting to change myself.[man saying, “I can change, and I will change.”]I think I'd rather try to find different ways around problems than trying to myself or tryingto change someone else. And I think that… -- I don't know if my work informs that, or if Ibecame a personality psychologist because I've always been that way. I don't know, but Ihave a pretty… I'm trying to soften a little bit in that because I know I’m too extreme in myview about that in my personal life.Alie: You're like, "I have the data!"Simine: Yeah. Right. [laughs] [woman saying, “These are the receipts!”]But the data do show that people change. In the maturation stuff like if you enter arelationship, or you become a parent, or you gain responsibilities, you actually becomemore responsible and more mature, and the evidence is pretty clear. And that, I think, issomething I’m trying to internalize more. My rational side, my academic side knows that’strue, but in my personal life I think I tend to be like, “You're gonna be the same way as youwere 20 years ago!" So yeah, it's a case where maybe I'm actually… my personal viewsdon't match up with the evidence. 18Alie: Do you ever study couple dynamics at all? Like what personalities fit better? And whenyou watch movies does that ever freak you out, like, “That's not gonna work! You're bothextroverts!"Simine: That's funny. I don't study it much, but there is research on that. And it turns outpersonality's not the most important determinant of whether couples are going to work.Values matter a lot more.Aside: Side note to anyone asking, “What values in partnerships are ones that mypartner and I should value?” I'll say them quickly; Caring about others, avoiding harm toothers, seeking pleasure, personal success in life, maturity, independence in thought andaction, and security. If you're like, “I hate all those values. Those values are for pansies.”Then that's cool. Just find another, similar asshole, who feels the same way.Simine: So being similar or different on personality doesn't really matter that much for whetherthe couple's likely to work out, but having similar values and things like that, that mattersmore. With personality, it's more what we call a main affect, so it's not the interactionbetween the two people, it's just the absolute level of personality traits that each personhas. And it turns out that if either or both of the partners are disagreeable or neurotic, thatmakes relationships harder. Maybe they could be richer and more rewarding if they canwork, I don't want to judge, but disagreeable and neuroticism tend to predict moredissatisfaction and more breakup in relationships.Although, I have one bone to pick with relationship research, which is, they always definebreaking up as a bad outcome, so when you look at… they'll talk about, like, this is a riskfactor, it's a negative trait because it predicts breaking up. But to me that's not clear thatit's always a bad outcome. Many people should break up, and for many people it's apositive experience and it leads to new experiences in the future that they wouldn't havehad otherwise. So this assumption that the ‘good relationship’ is the one that staystogether is a weird assumption to me in relationships research. So, I would take that… Youknow, just because disagreeable people tend to break up more doesn't necessarily meanthat they are making worse choices. For some people breaking up might be the rightchoice.Alie: Yeah, and break ups can be the best period of growth, and new haircuts, and mix tapes,and journal entries that you wouldn't have had otherwise. Is there any flimflam that youwould debunk, any myths about personality that really get your goat?Simine: I think there's a lot more mystery around personality than there needs to be, and I don'tknow why. I think that people think that you have to be an expert and you have to take thisreally convoluted test that will ‘reveal’ your personality. But actually, you don't have to trythat hard to reveal your personality. If you ask yourself some basic questions, and thinkabout your behavior and how people see you, and things like that, I think that you wouldget pretty far. I think what's really frustrating as an academic personality psychologist isthat what gets popularized about personality is completely different than what'sscientifically valid. There's this huge gap between what the public reads about personality 19and what's actually, scientifically valid. And in trying to understand why, I think it'sbecause the scientifically valid stuff is actually quite boring. [male voice, “Boooring!”]Basically, if you want to know, well, what do narcissists do differently than nonnarcissists? They brag more, and they're more vain, and you didn't need an expert to tellyou that, right? Everybody could have guessed that.Aside: [humorously morphed] I mean, not to brag, but, I could have guessed that. I'm prettysmart. [chuckle]Simine: So, I think a lot of the more true things about personality are quite obvious and boring,partly because we all have to be experts on personality. It's not going to be these supercounter-intuitive things, because we've already figured them out in the course of everydaylife. I would just say personality is not that mysterious, it's not that hard to see in ourselvesor in others. And if you're reading something that makes it sound like it is, like if you haveto uncover something really, really deep to really know someone's personality, that'sprobably not true. [male voice, “That's deep.”]Alie: So, the fact that it's this big mystery, like we have a secret inside us, it's our personality, isprobably not…Simine: Right. For most of us, I think that's not true. There might be a few people in the world whoreally have fooled everyone else and their true personality is really different than howthey come across, but that's extremely rare, I think.Alie: What other challenges do you have in studying this? In terms of that gap between who weare and who we think we are?Simine: The biggest challenge is that there's no absolute truth of the matter, right? I can't just drawblood from you and know that this is your personality. There's no direct pipeline, so that'sa big challenge. Another one, I think that we struggle with as personality psychologists isthat to study it quantitatively we have to put numbers on people, right? So, one commonmisconception is that we put people into categories. We actually don't. The best scientificevidence suggest that there is not categorical differences between people. It's all on acontinuum. It's not the case that there's extroverts and then there's introverts, it'sbasically a bell-shaped curve and most people are somewhere in the middle. That's whythings like ambivert is so popular. Or like, I keep seeing different terms for theextroverted-introvert or the introverted-extrovert. It's called being in the middle on anormal curve.So, we don't categorize people because it turns out that's just not the shape of thedistribution. It's not two boxes. It's a continuum, but we do put numbers on people, sowe'll say you're in the 60th percentile on extroversion or whatever. And of course that's…we can't actually know that so precisely, it's an estimate, there's some uncertainty aroundthat. But it still, I think, feels uncomfortable to people to put numbers on something as,kind of, rich as personality, [“Oh, that's rich! That's really rich!”] and to have, you know, fivedimensions, and “once we have these five numbers about you, we've got you figured out,”or whatever. 20I think it's important to convey that I don't know any personality psychologist whoactually thinks that you can describe someone in their full complexity with 5 numbers, oreven with 25 numbers or 100 numbers if we go into the finer grain traits within the BigFive. But if we want to study it quantitatively we have to end up… We don't just use fivenumbers, we often have many, many more numbers than that, but it's still numbers. And Ithink that can feel very reductionistic and harsh, I think, to a lot of people. It's like, we can'tcompletely capture someone's experience with numbers, but there's still a lot ofinteresting stuff we can study.Alie: I don't see any other way around it. 'Cause what are you gonna do? You can't just have aspreadsheet full of words. You just have to translate them into something that you cancompute.Simine: Right. Yeah.Alie: And is that part of the methodology of it? Is trying to really figure out… ?Simine: Yes, personality psychologists spend a lot of time developing questionnaires and finetuning them and arguing about, like… if I ask you, "On a scale from 1-5, how often do youlike to be around other people?" And 1 is never and 5 is always. We will spend hours at aconference arguing about, "Should it be a 1-5 scale, or a 1-7 scale? Or maybe it should bean even numbered scale so there's no mid-point?" And you can have all kinds of academicdebates about those things, and we do.Alie: What are those conferences like? More introverts? More extroverts? More ambiverts?Simine: Oh, WAY more introverts.Alie: Really?Simine: I think introverts are overrepresented, probably in academia in general. Maybe not inpsychology. I feel like the social sciences have a lot of extroverts, but within psychology,personality is a very introverted group, interestingly. I don't actually have any evidence forthat, but I feel… I would bet a lot of money on that.Alie: Very quiet cocktail hours.Simine: Yeah. We're not the socializers of psychology. If you go if you go to a social psychologyconference, there's way more talking, and socializing, and partying going on than at apersonality psychology conference. We do have dance parties, but we're very… we gosomewhere secluded and isolated where no one can see us and then we do our nerdydance parties. [“Good morning, dance party!!”]Aside: So can we pretend to be something we're not? This next revelation was such asurprise. And a comfort to me.Alie: I maybe didn't realize that I had more introverted tendencies, because I just was alwaysstuffing them down. I was like, "No! Get out there! Be social! Or else people are going tothink that you don't like them!"Simine: Yeah, and I think a lot of extroverts think that that makes them an ambivert or, you know,introverted-extrovert or whatever, but nobody's always extroverted. Nobody always feels 21like socializing. And this idea that you get energy from socializing, nobody gets energyfrom socializing! It's one of the myths… one of the things that's wrong about the MeyersBriggs, is that it makes a lot of extroverts question whether they really are extrovertswhen they read that. But no, you are an extrovert even if you're tired at the end of a party,or you don't always feel like talking, or… That's fine. Everybody feels that way sometimes.It's just that introverts feel that way even more.Alie: Okay! That always sparked my curiosity, because I was like, "Who goes to a work partyand is like 'I'm ready to go!"" You know?Simine: "Let's do this thing again tomorrow!" [both laughing]Alie: Yeah, exactly!I have so many questions from patrons.Simine: Okay.Alie: Can I ask you some?Simine: Yeah, of course.Alie: Okay.Aside: Before we get to questions from patrons, first, a few words from our sponsorsof this show. One reason for doing ads is that a portion of the proceeds go to a cause thatthe -Ologist chooses each week, and Simine picks SIPS, the Society for the Improvement ofPsychological Science, which brings together scholars working to improve methods andpractices in psychological science. Anyone interested in improving psychological researchis welcome to join regardless of experience. You can learn more at ImprovingPsych.org. Sothat is this weeks donation. And I'll put a link in the show notes. Okie doke!Let's get to your questions.Alie: Obviously this is something that's... Everyone has some experience with, given thateveryone probably has a personality.Simine: Everyone and their dog, literally. [laughs]Alie: [laughs] So many people, Tina Rautio, Stephanie Broertjes, Adriana Torres, BeritMaddison, Cody Albert, Tegan Moore, Kayla Brigham, and Alexa Fuss, everyone wanted toknow about psychopaths and sociopaths. What personality traits would a psychopathhave, and is that a personality or is it a personality disorder?Simine: I think you could think of it either way. Like narcissism, there's the disorder and thenthere's probably the sub-clinical version, the ‘everyday’ version. I'm not an expert on this,so I think the common factor with psychopathy and some other kind of disorders that aresimilar is a lack of compassion. It's a kind of very low agreeableness where people are notconsiderate or have… maybe some people would describe it as not having a conscience atthe very extreme end. But callousness, I think, is a very common characteristic of peoplewho are high in psychopathy. I think that is, kind of, the defining feature. 22Aside: Yes. Psychopathy talk again. Simine says this isn't her field of expertise, but inlooking for definitions, I'll give you a rough sketch, partly because this could be a wholeepisode in and of itself. The history of it is sticky, the diagnosis is sticky, different editionsof diagnostic manuals don't recognize psychopathy as a clinical diagnosis. It's traditionallythought of as a personality disorder, ASPD, or anti-social personality disorder. Insociopathy, is somewhat of a less severe form, and one expert on the matter, a criminalpsychologist, Dr. Robert Hare, describes sociopathy as only differing from the averageperson in the sense of right and wrong. But psychopathy is not having a sense of empathyor morality.Therefore, all psychopaths are sociopaths, but sociopaths are not necessarily psychopaths.It's the old "all cacti are succulents, but not all succulents are cacti." So, some traits ofpsychopathy are; a lack of guilt or remorse, lack of empathy, lack of deep emotionalattachments, narcissism, superficial charm, dishonesty, manipulativeness, reckless risktaking. So, there you go.Alie: What is the difference between a personality and a personality disorder?Simine: That's a really good question. There's a lot of debate on that. My best understanding is thatit's a matter of degree rather than a matter of kind for most personality disorders. Theremight be some exceptions, but most personality disorders, it's not the case that if you meetthe threshold for disorder you're qualitatively different than someone who's close to thethreshold but doesn't cross it. For example, in the case of narcissism there are people whohave diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder, and then there's people who are justreally arrogant, and exaggerate a lot, and are condescending to others. And if they do thatall the time in many contexts and are persistently that way every time, they might notquite reach the threshold of a personality disorder. But it is the same spectrum, they'rejust not as far out on the spectrum.Alie: So there's a lot more bell-shaped curves than boxes in personalities.Simine: Yeah. For sure.Alie: Amber Willis had a great question: What about the birth order between siblings in relationto certain personality tests. Is it just a myth?Simine: It's just a myth.Alie: Really?Simine: Yeah. So there's really good research on this. There might be tiny, tiny effects, but nothingthat would be practically meaningful or detectable to us in our everyday lives. So if youthink you see a pattern, it's just random fluctuations.Alie: Oooh! That's such a surprise!Simine: At least on personality. There might be birth order effects on other things. But onpersonality, there's no consistent differences.I read this great book. It was a theory about why there should be birth order differences,called Born to Rebel. It's a really fascinating theoretical account. It just turns out not to be 23true. But yeah, you could imagine why first-borns might have different personalities thanlater-borns.Alie: Yeah, and middle kids always seem the most stable.Aside: Hats off to all the Jan Bradys of the world, and the Malcolms in the Middle, ormy sister Janelle, who always seemed to have it together more than all of us combined.Simine: Yeah, yeah. I had the same intuition, but the evidence suggests there's nothing there.Alie: Madalyn Rogers asks: How did the astrological signs become tied with particular characterand personality traits? Is it accurate at all? Asking as a Pisces who is afraid of water.Simine: Interesting. I'm a Pisces too.Alie: Are you afraid of water?Simine: I am not afraid of water. I like water. I'm afraid of deep water, but I like water.It's funny, once I was at a party and this guy came up to me, and he was trying to hit on me,and he was like, “what's your sign? I can tell you about your personality.” And I was like,“Yeah. I don't… [laughs] You're talking to the wrong person.” And then he was like, “What'syour sign?” And I was like, “Pisces,” and he's like, “You're stubborn.” And I was like "...Okay,but you got lucky on that one!” [both laughing]But no, there is no validity to the astrological sign connection to personality. I don't knowwhere the idea came from. That's a good question, historically.Aside: P.S.; A little bit of digging revealed that a Japanese study found that peopleborn December - February have lower agreeableness, i.e., kinda jerks, or at least‘charmingly assertive.’ And then another study reported that summer born males wereless conscientious.But, but, but! In the 1980s a very badass, curious dude named Dr. Shawn Carlsonwondered about the efficacy of astrology and conducted a double-blind experiment wherehe gave 24 respected astrologers 100 personality profiles and, and, and…! The study foundthat astrologers were unable to match natal charts to their corresponding personality testsbetter than chance. Carlson was like, “Hey! Astrology, y'all flimflams.”Now, I know this, and I believe in science, but does this stop me from reading SusanMiller's Astrology Zone and screen-capping it to send it to friends sometimes? No, it doesnot. It's free, it's fun, let me live. If Dr. Caleb Finch can enjoy Benjamin Button, then we canbe entertained by a horoscope if we want. But just remember, neither are nonfiction.Alie: Isabelle Holper asks: How can a dramatic event or the loss of someone close to youinfluence your personality, or can it?Simine: It can. Again, I think most of the changes are not dramatic. I think life events have smallimpacts on our personality and they add up, so if you have a lot of, you know, negativeevents or a lot of positive events, I think that that can add up to a really big change. Butusually one event, even if it's pretty dramatic, won't have a huge impact on yourpersonality. Again, there are exceptions. We can all think of people that did change quite 24dramatically in a short period of time, but that's the exception rather than the rule. So in away it's nice ‘cause we're more resilient than I think we might be afraid of.Certainly, major negative events will have an impact for a while. And some will have animpact forever. Unemployment can have a pretty long-term impact, at least on people'shappiness and well-being, which you could construe as an aspect of personality.Unfortunately, positive events tend to have a shorter lasting impact than negative events[sad slide whistle] but yeah, they tend not to have a really dramatic effect.Alie: That's interesting. Sarah Nichelle wants to know: Why does abuse makes some peoplekinder, and then others act like their abusers? So, why do people sway after something…?Simine: I mean, some of that might just be their genetic predisposition or their preexistingpersonality before the abuse. It could be that, you know, if you were already a veryconsiderate and kind person, that abuse might accentuate that, and that might be yourcoping mechanism, is to just be extra kind to everybody. And if you were someone whotended to be the opposite, then the abuse might exaggerate that. I don't know if that'sempirically true, but that would explain why people react differently, if they are differentto begin with. Often your baseline personality will predict how you react to an event or asituation, and it could exaggerate the differences between people.Alie: These are such great questions, so many people; Danni Q, Maia Welbel, Kellie Windsor,Danelle Von, all kind of asked a little bit about how contagious is personality? Like, if youspend an excessive amount of time around another person, how much does it shape yourpersonality? Is there an alpha effect, like, where there's dominance and status that changeswho you are?Simine: I think in the short term there are complementarity effects on dominance, so if I'minteracting with someone who's much more dominant than me I'm going to take a moresubmissive role in that interaction. And then for other personality or behavior patternsthere might be the opposite effect, where you become more similar to your interactionpartner. So I think, like, warmth, if you’re interacting with someone who’s really warm,you're going to match their warmth. It's interesting that on some things, it pulls for theopposite of what your interaction partner is like, like on dominance, and on other things itpulls for similarity.But those are short-term effects, so it's like, in our interaction we're going to become moresimilar on warmth and more opposite on dominance while we are interacting. But longterm, like, if you live with somebody, the research suggests there isn't any long-termcontagion of personality. You don't become more like your roommates or your partners.Aside: So, not for the long-term, although research shows that in the short term, youre-framing things for a bummed-out friend can help them, but it might leave you feeling alittle exhausted and worse about yourself. So, if you're everyone's cheerleader, way to go!But psychologists recommend taking care of yourself, setting aside a few extra moments inthe day to think positive thoughts about your own circumstances. “I'm a badass who helpstheir friends. I'm a beacon of light in the darkness. I make pretty good lasagna. My hairlooks SO good today.” 25Alie: Shea Goddard asks if you believe in ‘type A’ and ‘type B’ personality traits.Simine: There's some truth to that, but I think it's oversimplified. I think that, like, the Big Five is abetter model of differences between people. Type A and Type B, kind of, pushes peopleinto, like we talked about, boxes instead of a continuum.Alie: And some other people had some questions, you know, going back to narcissism. TheresaBossenova had a great question: In the age of social media, how do you best deal withnarcissistic friends. And also just in general, in our culture now, are we trending towardthat because of circumstance?Simine: I think the best evidence suggests there is no difference between now and previousgenerations in terms of narcissism or the effect of social media on narcissism. It's veryeasy to see. Like, you can remember specific cases of people being really narcissistic andsocial media exaggerating that, but I actually think that's not… There's no long-term trendin that direction, or at least the evidence isn’t very clear that there is, but there'scontroversy around that. I mean, you could see it as a way that makes it really easy toknow who to avoid because the narcissists out themselves on social media.If it wasn't for social media it might take a year of knowing somebody before you couldreally see how narcissistic they are, you know, maybe in some cases, although usually itcomes out faster than that. But social media just speeds it up, right? Like, you can tell moreeasily, I think. The more avenues you have for someone to express themselves, the morequickly you can judge their personality more accurately.Alie: Yeah, I guess it's like having access to someone's journal, pretty much. You know, straightshot into their… what they want to project and what they're going through.Aside: What about public figures? [Donald Trump: "I’m a very stable genius."] [KanyeWest: "I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation!"]Simine: That's another thing we debate within our field, is like, is it irresponsible for us to make aprofessional judgment on a famous person's personality without ever having met them?And certainly, for clinicians, I think it's considered bad professional practice, but asnot-clinical, just describing their personality from a scientific standpoint, I'm kind ofneutral on that. I think, obviously, we can tell. I don't think personality experts have muchto add to what's already obvious to everyone.Alie: Lauren Chiodo wants to know: Are there anyone personality types that should be redflags?Simine: It depends on your preferences. So even… we talked about narcissism. First, I wouldchange the term ‘type’ to ‘trait’ just to go back to this whole categorical-versus-continuousthing. So, if everything's on a continuum, you know, you might like narcissistic peoplebecause they're really charming, and funny, and they're the life of the party, and they keepthings interesting. Some people are fine with being in a relationship or living withsomeone who's high on narcissism. That's fine. 26I think that you have to figure out what you're okay with. Some people couldn't ever be ina relationship with someone really introverted. That would drive them nuts, so… Youknow, different people have different preferences.Aside: Maybe you couldn't love someone who loves themselves a whole bunch. Ormaybe, people who seem like they really love themselves, are the ones who don't really,deeply love themselves enough, which is all the more reason to show them love. I don'tknow. Just everybody be nice to each other, okay? Thank you.Alie: Eloisa Froes wants to know: Are there any personality traits associated with highperformance or success? The same way that it seems to have biological correlation to highlevels of testosterone and low cortisol levels, like, with CEOs and other leadership folks?Simine: Yeah, so there are personality predictors of success. It's kind of, almost, circular. Basically,if you're conscientious, which includes being self-disciplined, and responsible, andorganized, and on time, you're going to have more professional success. That's a prettystrong predictor of professional success. Pretty much across… no matter what careeryou're in, conscientiousness is going to be a predictor of success.Aside: If you're like, “What does conscientiousness really mean?” Some personalitypsychologists had the same question. They set out to define it more concretely with astudy that looked at how much certain people engaged in 11 behavioral factors, such as:Avoiding work, organization, impulsivity, anti-social behaviors, cleanliness,industriousness, laziness, appearance, punctuality, formality, and responsibility. The studywas called, What Do Conscientious People Do? I'm guessing because the Board rejected thetitle: Who has their fucking shit together?Simine: And then, depending on their career, other traits might or might not predict it. If you’re ina sales job then extroversion is an asset. Same with teaching, extroverts get better teachingevaluations. If you're in a creative job, then being high on the Openness to Experiencefactor is going to be an asset, you're going to have more success. But again, it's almostcircular. Like, part of being high on Openness to Experience is being curious, and creative,and open minded, so that is just part of the job description for a creative job. So yeah,different jobs will, kind of, suit different personality traits better. But conscientiousness is,kind of, the main factor that predicts success in general.Aside: She gestured again to her office, which I am telling you, was not that messy,just some stacks of papers! Some books. From the way she describes it, you'd think therewas a month-old cheeseburger on the windowsill. There was not.Simine: But if someone figures out the neatness [both laugh] thing I would love to know, because Ijust can't, for the life of me, be neat.Alie: There are, like, no plates of food in here. You're doing fine.Simine: I'm not dirty, I'm just not organized.Alie: No! You're doing fine! I'm sure you'd know… if you had to find a piece of paper, you'dknow which stack it's in. 27Simine: Which pile? [laughs]Alie: Exactly. That's organization!Simine: Yeah.Alie: Any movies about personalities that annoy you, or you think are good at exploring it?Simine: That's a good question. One movie that stuck with me, I don't remember… I don't know if Iwant to, like, endorse it as being accurate or anything like that, but it was fascinating to mebecause it's about self-knowledge is I Heart Huckabees.Alie: Oh, yes!Simine: And he hires an existential detective to follow him around. So, you asked earlier about“How should we learn about ourselves. What should we do if we want to know what ourpersonality is like?” And I said, “Maybe, don't ask your friends.” But if there was such athing as an existential detective that you could hire to become an expert on you, and thengive you feedback, that would be fascinating. I remember when I watched that movie, Iwas like, “If that job existed, that would be my dream job!” Just, like, follow someonearound, and take notes, and then tell them, “This is what you're like!” [clip from movie:"What kind of investigation?" "Existential" "You'll spy?" "Yes." "On me?" "Yes." "Will you bespying on me in the bathroom?" "Yes"]I think one thing people don't spend enough time thinking about is, “Okay, if I can't changethis aspect of my personality, what can I do so that it doesn't have a negative impact on mylife or on other people?” So, when I figured out that people can't tell when I like them, Ilearned I have to explicitly tell people, "I had a really good time last night! I enjoyed it," or,"I like you. I would like to hang out again…" or whatever, because I'm not that expressive,and so it won't come across. I haven't necessarily gotten a lot better at that, but I thinkthat's a more viable way to change than actually becoming more expressive, for example.Aside: A few days after this interview, I got an email from Simine, just saying, “It wasgreat talking with you last week! I hope the rest of your visit was good! Thanks again forinviting me onto your podcast!” Which was so sweet, I was so touched.Alie: So, just change some of your behaviors instead of your core identity.Simine: Yeah, or like, find out what the negative consequences are of your personality traits, andthen try to ward off those consequences instead of changing your personality trait. Itseems a little bit more realistic to me than changing your personality.Alie: And what is the thing that is the most irritating about your job, or the part that you hatethe most? Anything from parking to, uh, something existential?Simine: Um… [Jeopardy theme]Alie: Parking, so far was the only downside I could see. [laughs]Simine: [laughs] Yeah. Um… [Jeopardy theme continues]Alie: It's good that you can't think of anything. 28Simine: It's not easy. I'm trying to think, like, how into-the-weeds to get about what an academicjob is like.[Jeopardy theme concludes]I mean, honestly, the most annoying part of my job is having to apply for grants. That's notfun, and part of the reason… I mean, just having to ask for money is annoying, and youconstantly have to. Even if you get a grant, within a year it's going to run out soon and youhave to start thinking about applying for grants again. So that's annoying, but also becauseit's, kind of, this weird marketing thing where you have to sell yourself, and talk about whyyour idea are transformative and they're going to change the world. You have to figure outhow to sell your work. I don't like that aspect of it.[Oliver Twist: “Please, sir. I want some more.”]Alie: What is the thing that you love about your job or your work the most?Simine: I love the freedom to change my mind about things, or change direction. I could have beenstudying something for five years and then decide, “Oh, actually, I don't think that's trueanymore and I'm gonna try to find the opposite.” Or, “I'm just going to go in a differentdirection.” And I love that I have the freedom to do that, that I have job stability so I cansay, “my work from 5 years ago is wrong,” and there's no consequences, or not a lot ofconsequences. So yeah, it's fun because it gives you the freedom to play with ideas, andkind of argue both sides, and figure out…With self-knowledge, I get this a lot. Like, I'll sometimes say people are pretty good aboutknowing this about themselves, and then in another paper I'll say people have this blindspot. And then people will be like, “You need to choose a side! Are you for self-knowledgeor against self-knowledge?!” And I'm like, “No, I don't have to choose a side and that's thebeauty of it.”Aside: Are there any books on personality psychology that she recommends? Sheglanced at over at a bookshelf and very quickly settled on a favorite.Simine: If they're interested in learning about personality, it's a textbook, so it's a weirdrecommendation, but it's such a readable textbook. The Personality Puzzle by DavidFunder. In the show Felicity she was carrying it around when she was in college.[clip from Felicity: "Dear Felicity... Here it goes. I've watched you for 4 years, alwayswondered what you were like..."]Simine: It's just… it's so much better than what you imagine when you think of a textbook. It's notdry, it has a really nice narrative voice. The author, David Funder, is really, really good atthat. And it’ll teach you the basics of the Big Five and other… He's actually not a huge fan ofthe Big Five, so it's a nice, balanced perspective on it. It won't feel like ‘drinking Kool-Aid’as much as, maybe, my interview has sounded like.Alie: [laughs] Nooo! No, it's… I wasn't sure if you would have faith in any of the tests, so it'sreally interesting to hear from your perspective, like, this one's worth it. I thought you'd,maybe, say that they're all garbage, so I wasn't...29Simine: No, there are good tests out there. Yeah.Aside: So go forth, whether you start recording life snippets, or dive into a psychologytextbook, or take a quiz, to figure out which planet you are (and yes, that quiz exists). Ormaybe just ask a close confidante to draft you an honest letter on turkey stationary.Alie: Thank you so much!Simine: It's great. I'm glad to be on the show.Alie: Oh, yay! I hope I didn't ask you too many questions.Simine: No, not at all. So, check in withyour bod right now. Are you cold? Are you hot? How do you feel? Are you sweating? Is this toomany personal questions? Okay, let’s change the subject… to me. Well actually, to you.Thank you so much as always to the patrons who support Ologies at Patreon.com/Ologies, foreveryone who gets themselves some Ologies merch to put on their warm (or their cold) bodies, andof course everyone who subscribes, rates, especially who reviews the podcast. You know I readyour reviews each week, and as creepy proof, here’s a fresh one. Bowerbird77 wrote:I drive in to work 2 days a week. Some days the thought of getting out of the house with a braand mascara seem too much, until I remember that a new episode awaits. I can’t wait to hearwhat ol’ Dad Ward has in store for my commute tomorrow. PS- Stay with me when you cometo Philly. Open invitation. I’m mostly normal.How can I say no to that? Also, CaecincolaCookorum left a sweet review that asked:Been listening for a while and I’m still not sure why Alie refers to herself as “Dad” Ward.It’s a great question. It started in a podcast Facebook group because I like hot dogs and bad puns,and I’m just very likely to lecture you about tire pressure safety because I love you. I just want youto be safe.Okay, Thermophysiology. Let’s get into it! Let’s get it into us, rather. Thermós in ancient Greekmeans ‘hot’. ‘Physio’ derives from the word for nature. So, everything from hotness and nature tocoldness in a lab, as we will soon discuss. This Ologist is amazing. I met him over Thanksgiving at adinner held by our mutual bud, Cara Santa Maria of the Talk Nerdy podcast. New to LA, having justtaken on the role of Professor at UCLA, he mentioned some of the courses he teaches and hispodcast, The Biology of Superheroes. From there, I gently begged him to be on Ologies. Then I foundout we had more mutual friends, such as the Erins Welsh and Allmann Updyke, of the Epidemiologyepisode and This Podcast Will Kill You. Essentially I was like, “Hello, Sir, I regret to inform you thatyou will be my friend, forever.”What a better time to talk about body heat issues than February, when it’s cold, heaters arecranked, nary a daffodil bulb has sprung from the slush? So, we scheduled a time to record. Ireached out to ask for a few more days though, because I was so behind working on the agingepisode that I literally cried that day. So, this Ologist kindly let me reschedule for a few days. Then Iheaded over to his brand-new office at UCLA, where he was wearing normal person clothes and Iwas wearing four layers and a scarf because I’m a Chihuahua.He showed me some fancy chambers in his lab and we settled in to have an absolutely wonderfuland informative chat about how critters adapt to temperature changes, lizard storms, dinosaurblood, hibernating bears, why you sweat in your sleep, maybe you specifically, anti-freeze frogs,miracle hamsters, why different people run at different temperatures, how comic books influencethe way he sees science, learning how his brain works, and some time management hacks that heuses as a professor and host of The Biology of Superheroes Podcast. So get ready to warm up to yournew biology hero, Thermophysiologist, Dr. Shane Campbell-Staton.2----------Dr. Shane Campbell-Staton: … I get it every once in a while, or sometimes Staton-Campbell. It’s amess. Hyphenated names: it’s a difficult life to live.Alie Ward: Now, this is your first harsh southern California winter.Shane: [sarcastically] Oh, so harsh. Yes, I’ve spent my life sort of bumping around a bunch ofdifferent places, and before I moved here I was in Montana. Before Montana I was inIllinois, and then before that I was in Boston. All of which have pretty harsh winters. Beforethat, I was in Rochester, New York, which may actually be the snowiest place in the entirecountry.Alie: Ughhh!Aside: Quick aside. I looked this up and Rochester is the 4th snowiest of the lower 48States, clocking in at about 99 inches of snow per year, which is just an inch or two lessthan Anchorage, Alaska typically gets. Now, if you’re listening in Syracuse, New York rightnow, you are screaming in your car or at your phone. You are saying, “Yes, bitch! Rochesteris Florida compared to our 123 inches of snow!” So yes, Syracuse, New York, you win formost snow-related winter suffering. Also, on the sunny side, if you’re doing all thatshoveling, you probably have pretty good core strength, pretty good abs. I dunno, that’s allI got.Shane: And for the longest time, I remember moving up from South Carolina. I was like, “What isthis ‘lake effect’ that people keep talking about?” Because it was the first time I’d ever heardof it. Then the first winter came and I was like, “Oh, it’s like a hurricane but cold, basically.”It was a harsh reality to live. So luckily, I bumped it over here to LA.Alie: Good work on that. Now, what was it about your upbringing that you thought, “I want tostudy biology. I want to study science, and particularly temperatures and cold”?Shane: Oh man. Those things did not come along intentionally by any means. When I was a kid, Igot really obsessed with reptiles. I don’t know what it was about the scalies that got me, butit was just a thing. My mother, bless her heart, she was super supportive, but she justdoesn’t do that sort of stuff. [Pee-wee Herman, “Ugh, I hate snakes!”] Yeah, but she wasreally supportive. I remember in high school I had all sorts of creatures for a senior projectI did. I had a python, several different lizards, a giant green iguana, a breeding pair of cornsnakes, all this sort of stuff. I was obsessed with it.Aside: Shane wound up getting his PhD in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology atHarvard University. But before that, as a young herp nerd, he figured biology would be thebest course if he wanted to study his beloved reptiles. And he got his Bachelor of Science inEcology and Evolutionary Biology at the very snowy (but yes, not as snowy as Syracuse,Syracuse) University of Rochester.Shane: So that’s what I did, and that’s when I got introduced to anoles.Alie: Oh, I love those!Shane: Yeah, they’re amazing! They’re so cool. Actually the one species of anole that is native tothe United States, it’s the very first animal I ever interacted with as a kid, because in SouthCarolina they’re just all over the sides of houses and stuff.Alie: And an anole is just a type of lizard, right?3Shane: Yeah, an anole is this typically small lizard that has this little throat fan, they do a bunch ofpush-ups, and they wave that little throat fan. There are about 400 species of anole that aredistributed across the neotropics, central South America, the islands of the Greater Antilles,and then our one special North American anole that’s native to the US. There’s a bunch ofother species now that are invasive, but that’s the one that’s native. That’s also the species Iended up studying for my dissertation.Alie: [voice rising with excitement] Oh, wait, so you started liking them when you were a kid andyou studied them to get your PhD?!Shane: Yeah, I know, right?Alie: You’re like, “Me again!” Oh, that’s amazing! Did you ever think when you were a kid,studying lizards and having corn snakes and having pythons, that you would get to do thisfor a living?Shane: I did not realize that this was a thing to do for a living, generally speaking. It is interestingthat when you ask most biologists how they got into science, they typically have this, “Oh,when I was a kid, I was walking through the woods, splashing in a tidal pool and I just knewfrom that point on.” That wasn’t my life. My mom worked really long hours. I was alatchkey kid, I spent a lot of my time indoors, so my introduction to the outside world, tonature and wildlife, was through television; Jeff Corwin and Steve Irwin, and then the littlegreen lizards that were around my house. So to go from there to being able to do things likethis, communicating science to people who don’t spend most of their lives doing this sort ofstuff, that’s a really special circle for me.Aside: How great is that? For real.Alie: So, when you got your PhD, what exactly were you studying about these anoles?Shane: I was studying the evolution of cold tolerance in anoles. Trying to understand howgeographic variation in temperature influences patterns of gene flow across space, andthen how it influences physiology, which ended up being a big question of mine becausethe green anole came from Cuba originally. Sometime during the Miocene or Pliocene, itwas transported from Cuba, most likely by storm. That’s typically the way these smallthings jump from island to island.Aside: So just FYI, yes, I did have to look up, “How long ago was somewhere between theMiocene and Pliocene?” The Miocene was anywhere from 5 to 23 million years ago. ThePliocene was 2 to 5 million years ago, so I think he’s talking 5-ish million years ago, theseadorable little green lizards came over from Cuba making things more enjoyable. Kinda likeliving daiquiris.Big ol’ stupid question, I’m just so glad that I asked:Alie: Do they go in the air?Shane: Yeah!Alie: Really?Shane: Yeah, they can fly through the air sometimes like flotsam, like driftwood or leavessometimes get blown across the water.Alie: Whoa, like a frog storm?Shane: Yes.4Alie: Oh god!Shane: Yeah, it gets real biblical real fast! [laughter] [clip from The Ten Commandments: Moses,“You shall see hail fall from a clear sky and burn as fire upon the ground…”]Alie: So they can just rain down Cuban anoles in a different part of the world?Shane: Yeah, more or less.Alie: [whispers] Oh, that’s awesome. That’s so cool.Shane: I have never heard of any first-hand reports of people experiencing lizard rain.Aside: PS, allow me to read to you an excerpt from the Sunbury American newspaper,dated November 21, 1857, headline: “Shower of Lizards”:[old timey voice] The LeRoy New York Gazette says that during the heavy rain of Sunday nightlast, live lizards, some of them measuring 4 inches in length, came from the clouds like manna,though neither as plenty nor half as welcome. They were found crawling on the sidewalks andin the streets, like fugitive infantile alligators, in places far removed from localities where theyinhabit.Nature: Just when you think it’s not a hallucination, it rains anoles.Shane: There’s a scientist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville whose work actually inspiredthe work that I did with the green anole. He showed me this photo when I went and visitedhim of this male green anole outside in the winter. There’s this huge icicle on the side of thepicture and that’s just such a weird environment for this tiny little cold-blooded subtropical animal to live in. I just thought it was fascinating. I got obsessed with how theseanimals were dealing with these novel cold temperatures.Alie: How were they?Shane: It’s actually kind of a complicated question. One of the things that we’ve found is that thefarther north you go, essentially the more cold hardy the animals become. We do thesetests when we’re looking at the limits of thermal tolerance. For ectotherms, cold-bloodedanimals, their internal body temperature is really tightly correlated with the external bodytemperature, and that means that their performance is really tightly tied to the externalbody temperature.Aside: How much beach volleyball would you play in the snow? None? Because theanswer’s none.Shane: So what we would do is go to a site, go into a population, catch animals, and bring them intothe laboratory. Then we do these trials where we goose ‘em, so we put a little thermometerin their cloaca.Alie: [laughing] Oh!Shane: Then we cool them down very slowly, like one degree Celsius per minute, and then we testfor their ability to maintain a writhing response. We’ll flip them onto their backs and thenwe try to get them to flip themselves back over because a lizard always wants to be on itsfeet. The temperature at which they can’t do that anymore, we call that their lower thermallimit, what’s called the critical thermal minimum. When we measured this across thegeographic range, we found that populations where the winter temperatures were coldesthad the animals that were the most cold hardy.5Aside: Hello, if you’re new to Ologies, a cloaca is a butt, and reptiles and birds enjoy theconvenience of a one-stop shop for poo, pee, sex, and scientific spa treatments involvingthermometers.Shane says there’s a lot of local adaptation. The lizards that can survive that cold haveoffspring that can also survive it, but they also just become hardier because they’re like,“Been there, done that.” [old timey snobbery voice] “I walked two miles in the snow uphill.”But unlike your friend’s cranky grandpa, these lizards are doing all of this in the nude.Don’t picture your friend’s grandpa in the nude. Don’t do it. Don’t.Anyway, in the wild, natural selection, right? But…Shane: But we bring gravid females into the lab, and they lay eggs, and those babies are born. Weraise those babies under common laboratory conditions so they’ve never seen a winteranywhere outside, and we do the same cold tolerance experiments. We find that theoffspring have the same level of cold tolerance as their parents did, which suggests thatthere’s some heritable, genetically based component to cold tolerance.Alie: And then, you and I are endotherms, correct?Shane: Yes, we are.Alie: How difficult was it not to apply some of your knowledge that you gained through studyinganoles to yourself as an endotherm walking around freezing in Montana?Aside: PS, I got his timeline wrong. Shane was studying anoles at Harvard and did hispost-doc on very cold ice in Montana. But anyway, in those cold places was he thinkingabout his own reactions to cold? I’m asking this as a person wearing a scarf in Los Angeles.Shane: It was pretty easy for me because reptiles are just really different from mammals. The waythat they experience temperature is very different from the way that mammals experiencetemperature.Alie: How do mammals experience temperature?Shane: Okay, so...Alie: This is exciting!Shane: Yeah, we’re going to go in right now.Alie: Okay. [laughs] [clip from Parks and Rec: Leslie Knope, “I’m going in.”]Shane: When we think about thermal physiology, how animals experience temperature and howthat temperature influences their function, there are four major categories. You can sort ofpick and choose the combination therein, and you can pretty much find an organism thatfits that description.Aside: Okay, here we go, into a matrix of different combinations of body heat you canhave if you weren’t already a hairy human. Maybe you shave. None of my business.Onward.Shane: The first difference is being ectothermic or endothermic. Endothermic organisms canproduce their own internal body heat. Ectothermic organisms cannot. Then we havehomeothermic versus poikilothermic.Alie: Whoa! That’s a good word!Shane: I know, it is a good word!6Alie: That is a Scrabble word!Shane: [laughs] It’s a good podcast word. Poy-key-low-therm-ick.Alie: [sarcastically] I know what that means, I’m not going to be looking that up and defining it inthe aside at all! [laughs] No, that’s going to happen.Aside: Yeah, I did not know this word, poikilothermic. And yeah, I gotcha covered withthe definition. A poikilotherm is an animal whose internal temperature varies considerably.It’s all over the place, as opposed to a homeotherm, which maintains homeostasis andkeeps the temperature pretty constant, like you and me. Shane explains how this is not justectothermic and endothermic. There’s a difference, and thus, a matrix.Shane: Homeotherms are able to maintain a constant body temperature. Poikilotherms have afluctuating body temperature with respect to their external environment; so as theirexternal environment fluctuates, their internal… So you have a tendency, generallyspeaking, to group endotherm and homeotherm together, and ectotherm and poikilothermtogether.Alie: That’s what I would think.Shane: Yeah, but it’s not always the case. For instance, you can have an endothermic poikilotherm.These are mammals that hibernate. For animals that hibernate for really long periods oftime, like weeks or months, their internal body temperature can actually drop to withinabout 1 degree Celsius of ambient temperature even though they have these internalmechanisms of producing heat. This is an energy-saving mechanism.Aside: So these endo-poiks, if you will, generate their own heat, but it can vary. Kind oflike a house with a furnace, but they set the dial depending on what they need. Now, in caseyou’re on a first date or a job interview that’s going badly and the only thing that can save itis naming some hibernating endothermic poikilotherms, here is a list: bears, gophers, bats,groundhogs. Just to name a few.Now, let’s say an ectotherm is like a house without a furnace. So the temperature could varywidely, but it doesn’t mean it has to.Shane: On the flip side, you can have an ectotherm that is actually homeothermic. This can happena couple of different ways. The first way is just by being really large. This is what we callgigantothermy.Alie: Oh, no! That’s not a word!Shane: Oh, it is a word!Alie: [yelling] Oh my god! Gigantothermy!Shane: [laughs] So for instance, the dinosaurs, but also things like saltwater crocodiles, which aremassive animals. And the largest lizard on the planet, the Komodo dragon.Alie: Oh, I was going to ask about them!Shane: Yeah, this is essentially a byproduct of surface to volume. If you are really large, yourvolume with proportion to your surface area is very large. That means that you lose heatrelatively slowly to the external environment. For instance, if you went to Australia or ifyou went to the Nile, you would see these really large crocodiles early in the morning,basking, just sitting in the sun with their mouths open, completely lifeless for hours.Alie: Oh god.7Shane: Then, by the heat of the day, they’re up and moving, they’re swimming around in prettycold water, and they can maintain that function because they’re so big.Aside: Okay, so that’s an endothermic homeotherm, like us. Endothermic poikilotherms:bears, groundhogs, et al. Then we were talking about ectotherms that maintain constantbody temperature just by being huge, but that’s not the only way to be an ectothermichomeotherm. Did I say that right?Alie: [in unison with Shane] Eck-toe-therm-ick home-ee-oh-therm. [whispers] Yes!Shane: -is through behavioral thermoregulation. Basically, this means paying really close attentionto the microthermal environments that are available to you. If you are a small lizard, forinstance, and it gets really hot outside, because you’re so small you’re gonna gain heatreally quickly because of that same volume-to-surface-area issue. Except if you move intothe shade. If you move into the shade at the right time and you stay there for long enough,you can actually maintain a steady body temperature even though you’re not producinginternal body heat.Alie: Oh, okay!Shane: And then insects do it a whole different way. Things like bees are technically ectothermichomeotherms because they can actually decouple their flight muscles and vibrate themwithout moving their wings to generate heat.Alie: Why do some animals and humans have set body temperatures that they need to maintainin order to live? Like, why do humans have to be 98.6, and are dogs a differenttemperature? And do mice in Montana have to be a different temperature than the ones inNew Mexico?Shane: That’s a great question. Generally speaking, it’s all about strategy; evolutionary strategyand life history strategy. Mammals benefit from being warm all the time. I can get up andmove regardless of what time of day it is. Because I have that high metabolism, I can go runand do really high-intensity activities for a pretty sustained period of time, much more sothan if I was an ectotherm. On the flip side of that, it also means that I have to take in muchmore energy in order to fuel that internal furnace that defines endotherms.Alie: So we have to be out grazing and hunting and finding food in order to have this 24-houropen supermarket of body heat?Shane: Yes, basically. I do know that humans as a lineage, as we migrated out of Africa into the restof the world, temperature played a huge part in that process. We can actually see it in thediversity of body shapes that we see around the planet. If we look within Africa, forinstance, right around the equator, it’s very warm and gets extremely hot during the day. Inresponse, the body changes proportions to manipulate this volume-to-surface area. This iswhat we call Allen’s rule. Allen’s rule states that in these warmer environments, animals –mammals specifically – have a tendency to grow longer, narrower limbs.By growing longer, narrower limbs, it’s like having a little pipe instead of a big thickappendage. By decreasing the volume with respect to that surface area, you can then dumpheat really quickly to the environment. That’s one strategy, so if you look at a lot of subSaharan African populations that occur right around the equator—very tall, very thinphenotypes. But then, as you move north into really high-latitude environments, look atpopulations like the Inuit – very different build, very compact. It prevents them fromdumping heat. It allows them to retain heat in the face of the cold much more efficiently.8Aside: Is there something from a physics standpoint, like a magic formula and the ratioof an animal’s body to their metabolism or heart rate? Like, at some point in time, didsomeone just frantically crunch these numbers on a chalkboard and start weeping?Shane: It’s complicated because it is not just a function of size. Behavior plays a really large role inthis as well. We can say things like Allen’s rule or Bergmann’s rule, which states that as youmove farther north, you get generally larger animals because larger animals are able tomaintain internal temperatures better.Alie: Oh, I never would’ve thought about that. Like, woolly mammoths were in Siberia, not justkickin’ it in Panama.Shane: Exactly!Alie: I never, ever thought about that.Shane: Yeah, but the largest mammal on the planet, the elephant, is smack dab at the equator.Alie: Well, what the hell’s up with that? [laughs]Shane: So, size is one parameter, but in order to get around the fact that they have so muchvolume-to-surface area, they’ve evolved very special features that allow them to cool. Ifyou’re out on the savanna or if you’re in India, a lot of times in the heat of the day, you’ll seethe elephants are typically in the shade. But you’ll also constantly see them fanning theirears, back and forth. If you look at their ears, they have these massive blood vessels that goout into their ears and it essentially acts as a personalized air conditioner. So, as they fantheir ears, that blood cools, and then that cool blood circulates back into their body and ithelps them to stay cooler.Alie: What are some other crazy adaptations that you’ve seen to deal with extreme heat or cold?Shane: Okay, I will go in on both. On the cold side of things, there are a lot of animals who havedeveloped extreme adaptations. The subfield of thermobiology that specializes in thosecold adaptations is called cryobiology. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the recent pictures, butpeople were freaking out because the lakes were freezing solid in North Carolina. Andwhen you look at the lakes, every once in a while, you see like a little snout that’s stuck andpoking up in the ice.Alie: Whose snoot was it?!Shane: That snout was connected to an American alligator.Alie: Oh, geez Louise.Shane: The alligator is stuck in the ice, but they’re able to deal with that really cold situation for apretty long period of time. But if you took an animal like a saltwater crocodile, it’s not anancestral selection pressure. Even more extreme, if you take ectotherms like reptiles andamphibians that occur at really high latitudes, or even insects that occur at really highlatitudes like close to the Arctic Circle, there are some species that can actually freeze solidfor months at a time and then thaw out and go on about their business. Animals like thewood frog, for instance.Aside: Okay, if you like badass frog stories that are bananas, and I know you do, here is abadass frog story. Wood frogs are like, “Oh, hibernation? Hold my beer. My very, very, verycold beer.”9Shane: Wood frogs, when they begin to freeze, they undergo a lot of significant physiologicalchanges. They begin to pump glycogen out of their livers into their bloodstream, sobasically sugar. They also dump urea into their bloodstream, which we typically try to getrid of through peeing.Alie: Uh, yeah. Usually that’s something you wanna off-board there!Shane: Exactly, but this combination of sugar and urea essentially acts as an antifreeze.Alie: Oh my god.Shane: So they can super-cool without the formation of ice crystals. Ice crystals are typically thething that is most dangerous about cold temperatures, because when water crystallizes,essentially it turns into little daggers that start stabbing and ripping apart cells. When youget severe frostbite and your toes turn black and fall off, that’s in large part because ofcrystal damage.Aside: If you just spaced out wondering how snow crystals form, do check out the SnowHydrology episode after this.Alie: Oof, and also it expands, right?Shane: Yeah, it’s basically like having little ice fortresses forming inside of your body, which yougenerally want to avoid. For hot temperatures, obviously there are animals all around theplanet that have evolved to live in extremely hot environments. In desert environments,there are some behaviors that evolved that are kind of funny. There’s a lizard species, forinstance, that lives in deserts and at the heat of the day, in order for them to survive, theyessentially rotate picking up their feet. They pick up two at a time, and it’s like if you wereto walk out on asphalt barefoot and you do that thing where you hop back and forth? It’sessentially how they get by.Alie: Oh god, that’s so fancy.Shane: I know, they’re very prance-y little lizards. I think they’re adorable.Alie: Like a dressage lizard, just [singing] boop-a-doop-a-doo.Shane: [laughs] Yeah, exactly. But also, we can think of even more extreme temperatures, likehydrothermal vents in the deep sea, which can have temperature gradients that arehundreds of degrees Fahrenheit over a very short distance. The most heat-tolerant animalsthat we know of on this entire planet live around those hydrothermal vents. I’m sureyou’ve seen these really large tubeworms that make these, sort of, tube forests aroundhydrothermal vents? They can take temperatures up to about 80° Celsius.Alie: How many Fahrenheits?Shane: Which is… [drumroll] like, 176° Fahrenheit.Alie: Oh my god! That’s so hot. [Nicole Richie, “That’s hot.”]Shane: It’s really hot. But they’re not the most heat-tolerant organisms on the planet.Alie: Which ones are?Shane: There are these small microorganisms, they’re called Pyrolobus fumarii.Alie: Oh my god, wait, okay, so something with smoke and fire?10Shane: Yes, exactly. I think still to this day, they are the most heat-tolerant organisms that we havefound, and they can take temperatures of 122°C.Alie: Whaaaat?!Shane: That’s a little more than 250°F.Alie: Where do they live?Shane: They also live around hydrothermal vents.Alie: Oh my god.Aside: PS: Their name translates literally to, ‘fire lobe of the chimney’. I pictured a tinyfireball or maybe a deep blue shiny creature with flames painted on the side of it, like a late1980s Camaro, but these single-celled heat-lovin’ microorganisms kinda look like a fuzzybrain.Hydrothermal vents: Hotter than… name a thing, it’s probably hotter than that. Like, forexample…Alie: I was thinking the hottest place on earth would be a roller skate after you’ve used it. [Shanelaughs] You know, sometimes you’re like, “Ugh, it’s hot and muggy in there.” But no, it’s ahydrothermal vent!Shane: Yeah.Alie: Oh my god! Okay, so they’re just like, “I’m here, no one else can deal with it. But I can, so Ican take as many resources as I need because I have adapted to just be able to deal withthis.”Shane: Precisely! Extreme performance typically evolves under extreme conditions. I think one ofthe coolest ways animals use heat- every time I think about this, I kinda freak out a littlebit. So, in order for me to tell you the story, I kinda have to give you the background.Alie: Yeah! Bring it on!Aside: Ohh, buckle up for a science saga you’ll never forget, my friends!Shane: In 1877, in Japan, people imported European honeybees for apiculture. There is a Japanesehoneybee, but it does not produce nearly as much honey as a European honeybee. So theybrought in European honeybees for apiculture, and they quickly found that Europeanhoneybee colonies would be destroyed by the Japanese giant hornet.Alie: Oh, no!Shane: It’s a really large voracious hornet. A group of 30 hornets could wipe out thousands ofEuropean honeybees. I mean, they would just go in, and they’re decapitating things andchewing ‘em up because they’re bringing those husks and bodies back to feed their larvae.Alie: Oh my god!Shane: They would just have these raiding parties where they go in and completely destroy theseEuropean honeybee colonies, which brought up the question: there’s this Japanesehoneybee that’s been here for so long, how do they survive in the face of this predator?Alie: Right!Shane: What they found was fascinating.Alie: Oh my god.11Shane: So the Japanese giant hornet has an upper thermal tolerance of about 115°F.Alie: Okay. Ooh, that’s still a lot.Shane: It’s a lot. The Japanese honeybee has an upper thermal tolerance of about 118°F. Thatdifference in their thermal tolerance, the Japanese honeybees figured out how to use it as aweapon.Alie: What?Shane: Remember we were talking about before; bees have this ability to decouple their musclesfrom their wings in order to generate heat. So what they would do is they’d use theirnumbers, and when a Japanese giant hornet would come into the hive, they would sort ofback off a ways and let it come into the hive, and then they would swarm it and form a ballaround the hornet.Alie: Nooooo!Shane: And then they would start vibrating and generating heat, and they would essentially cookand kill the hornet.Alie: Are you kidding me?! They would cook it?!Shane: Yeah! It’s this combination of the heat that’s generated and the carbon dioxide that’sproduced. It would heat up the temperature, but the excess carbon dioxide would alsolower the thermal tolerance of the hornet.Alie: So it’d be like a one-two punch.Shane: Exactly.Alie: [gasp!] Oh my god. What about the European honeybees? Did they get wise to this?Shane: No! Even now, if a Japanese hornet raiding party finds European honeybees, they cancompletely decimate a colony.Alie: So that three degrees is enough to kill off something that’s probably 10 times their size?Shane: Yes.Alie: Oh my god, that’s sooo badass! Oh my god!Shane: It’s one of my favorite stories about thermophysiology. [“Bring it onnnn!”] These are thesorts of things that evolve in extreme environments. So yeah, it’s crazy.Alie: Why am I getting chills thinking about cooking hornets? That doesn’t make any sense.That’s so wrong!Shane: Because it’s dope!Alie: [laughter] I know! But now, why am I cold?! Why does it give you chills? Okay, tell me alittle bit about being a professor, because you are a professor.Shane: I am.Alie: You teach here at UCLA.Shane: I do.Alie: So what kinds of courses do you teach and what has the response been?12Shane: So, being a professor at UCLA is some kind of special. I really love being here. The thing is,when you’re moving up through academia, there’s always this veil, right? You kind of seeother people moving back there, but you’re not really sure what’s going on back there.As an undergraduate, you might see graduate students. You’re like, “Oh, they look sostressed, I wonder what that’s about.” Then you become a graduate student and you’re like,“Oh, that’s what that was about.” Then you see postdocs and they’re like, [sobbing] “Oh mygod, I’m never gonna get a job!” And you’re like, “Why are they so stressed? They’repostdocs!” Then you become a postdoc and you’re like, “Oh yeah, this is really stressful.”But then as a postdoc, [laughs] you see a professor and you’re like, “How come their hair isalways crazy and they can never remember anything?” Then you become a professor andyou’re like, “Oh yeah, because there are so many things that I had no idea people weregoing to ask me to do!”Alie: Oh my god, what’s it been like?Shane: It’s been fun and I’ve had to learn a lot really quickly. The biggest thing I’ve had to learn ishow to multitask. I’ve actually very recently found out I have pretty severe ADD.Alie: Really?Shane: Yeah, really late in life, and I got through it because I could focus on one thing. I wouldwake up and my goal would be to accomplish this one thing, and regardless of how long ittook, sometimes I go to bed at 10, sometimes I go to bed at 3am, but I could get that onething done. I was a specialist, that’s how I made my way through academia. Then I got hereand I literally could not focus on one thing for more than, like, 45 minutes. Things reallystarted to disintegrate for me really quickly. So I went and talked to a doctor and they ransome tests and they’re like, “Yeah, this is really intense right now.” [laughs]Alie: Did that track for your past, too?Shane: Oh yeah, looking back, I definitely see it now. It kind of makes me a little upset because I’mlike, “How much easier could I have made life for myself if I had known about and coulddeal with this before?”Alie: Yeah, I mean, you went to Harvard, you got a PhD, and you’re a professor. So, speaking ofadaptability, you must’ve found really great ways to adapt, to focus on what you need tofocus, because you’ve accomplished so much.Shane: I mean, I found a way to do it for sure, but here in this position, I’ve had to learn differentways of doing things and I’ve had to learn those ways pretty quickly.Alie: Do you have any tips for the rest of us?Shane: Oh, man. I think the thing that helps me the most is to make a concrete list the night before.That’s the last thing I do before I close my eyes, and it’s the first thing I see when I wake up.Not just, “Here are a list of things to do.” Literally, from this time to this time I need toaccomplish this goal because I have this meeting at this time, which means I only have this45 minutes and it’s best if I do this particular thing then. All the way through the day.Sometimes it doesn’t work for me. Sometimes I sit down and things immediately fall apart.[Alie laughs] But the days where I can actually stick to that game plan are by far the mostproductive days for me.Alie: That’s so, so good to know. As someone who had to reschedule this because I was cryingabout missing a deadline, I’m like, “What else have ya got?!”13Shane: It happens to the best of us.Aside: Shane is such a boss. I want all of his time management strategies forever. Pleaseand thank you. Also, just listen to the name of this course he teaches at UCLA.Shane: So, my first course here at UCLA is called, “The Biology of Superheroes: Exploring theLimits of Form and Function.”Aside: Let’s hear that again, because it’s that wonderful.Shane: [triumphant horn music in background] So, my first course here at UCLA is called, “TheBiology of Superheroes.”Alie: [sings] Aaaaah!Shane: Yeah, it’s been a really fun class and it’s sort of been a slow build. I actually started thinkingabout this in graduate school as well. I got to a point when I was writing my dissertationwhere I was just burnt out. I was like, “I love science, but you can miss me with it right nowbecause I can’t stand this.” [Alie laughs] I remember one night, I was in the Museum ofComparative Zoology at Harvard, that’s where my office was. It was probably 8:30 or 9 atnight, and I just had to get up and leave. I walked off of campus into Harvard Square. I waswalking around the square and I passed this comic book store that was sort of in thebasement of a building. As I was passing the window, I saw this large hardbound comicbook, Superman vs. Muhammad Ali.Alie: Oh! They made a comic book about that?Shane: Oh yeah, they made a comic book about it. It was literally one of those double-takesituations like, “I’m sorry, what??” Right on the cover was Superman and Muhammad Ali,both in their boxing gloves, in the middle of a ring, going at it. I was like, “I have to figureout who wins in this scenario.” So I went in and that was the very first comic book I everbought.Alie: How old were you?Shane: I was 26, I think.Alie: So it skipped your childhood and you started getting into it in your 20s.Shane: Yeah, I was late to the game.Alie: That’s so cool.Shane: I had always been into science fiction and I remember watching the X-Men TV show as a kidand the Spiderman TV show on FOX Kids. But yeah, my first comic book I bought what, 5years into my PhD?Alie: Oh my god! So did you go back for more after you read that?Shane: Oh my goodness, yeah! I unlocked the beast. [Alie laughs] I went back and I bought severalover the next few weeks, and it ended up being sort of a guilty pleasure. It was funnybecause I would spend hours during the day reading the scientific literature, trying tofigure out how to formulate my own dissertation, and then I would go home and read GreenLantern or the X-Men as a way to escape from the rigors of academia. Then when I would goto sleep, I’d have these really weird, messed-up dreams that would fuse the two together,and all these questions of how the physiology and biology dealt with the science fiction.14It got so intense that I actually decided to teach a short course as a graduate student fortwo weeks to this small group of undergraduates. We just explored all these differentquestions like where the science meets the fiction, [“Science fiction, right?”] and that turnedinto this course. I also started my own podcast that deals with the biology of superheroes. Ifound that it’s actually a really fun thought experiment.In science, there’s these thought experiments, like Schrödinger’s cat, that really it’s anabstract way to help you understand concrete ideas. I found that science fiction actually is areally interesting thought experiment to understand the limits of performance and wherethose limits stop and why they stop where they stop. Then theoretically what would needto be accomplished in order for those limits to be pushed beyond. So yeah, that’s what wedo in the class. That’s what we try to do in the podcast.Alie: How quickly did that course fill up?Shane: Almost immediately. [laughter]Alie: That’s also perfect for Los Angeles, too, this hub of academia and art on the same campus.So, which superheroes could withstand the most extreme temperatures?Shane: Obviously, you have characters like The Human Torch, for instance.Alie: Well, there you go.Shane: I mean that’s pretty spot on. [clip from Brooklyn Nine-Nine: “I’m a human torch!”] Also,Ghost Rider with his flaming skull. [clip from Ghost Rider: “You are the rider. The GhostRider!”]But you also have other characters that just generally have high endurance, like Wolverine,for instance. [clip from X-Men Origins: Wolverine: William Stryker, “I can give you the tools todefeat him!”] This adamantium skeleton of his, plus his general ability to regenerate. Iimagine he’d be able to take some pretty hot temperatures. If I’m not mistaken, I think theIncredible Hulk has been thrown into the sun at least once [Alie laughs] and survived. [clipfrom Thor: Ragnarok: The Incredible Hulk, “Raging fire.”]Alie: [laughs] What kind of adaptation would you need skin and organ-wise to even deal withthat?Shane: I don’t think there is an adaptation that would allow for any organism to do it. So, even ifwe think about early Earth, for instance. Earth itself is 4.5 billion years old, more or less,and it took half a billion years for life to even show up in the first place. A big part of thatwas because that epoch before - the Hadean, which is literally Hell on Earth - it was really,really hot. You’re talking about surface temperatures that are approaching 600°.Alie: Oh my god.Shane: So, life had to kind of wait for things to cool down before it even had a chance to proliferate.Alie: The Hadean. I didn’t realize that’s what that was called. It’s just hell , literal hell on Earth.Just too damn hot. [Shane laughs] “Call me when you’ve cooled off. I’m not coming out ofthe primordial soup.”Shane: Exactly.Alie: Oh my god. Now, what about climate [singing] chaaaange? How are we doooing?Shane: Yeah, climate change, man. This is actually one of the major aspects of my research now, istrying to understand how thermophysiology evolves in response to these rapid changes. 15Typically, when we think about evolution, we think about it as this kind of slow, gradualprocess, especially when it comes to complex traits.Aside: Shane says that, for example, coat color is controlled by a couple of genes.Relatively simple, but a lot of the aspects of form and functions that he studies are, in hiswords, “the byproduct of the interaction of hundreds of genes that interact in thesecomplex, regulatory networks,” which means there’s a lot of complicated shit happening tomake an organism efficient and well adapted to its environment. So, you tinker with onepart and, well...Shane: There’s a saying that there’s a lot of ways to break a clock, right? So, if we think about anorganism as a clock, tinkering with something, you’re most likely going to break it. So,trying to understand how these complex systems can actually adaptively evolve in the faceof rapid change is one of the major research goals that I’m pursuing right now in my lab.Alie: How do you think humans will do with it? I mean, I wanna say, “Who cares about us?Because it’s our fault,” but for the other humans out there...Shane: The thing about humans that makes us special is that we have this remarkable ability tobuffer ourselves against extremes. So, if it gets too hot outside, we turn on the airconditioner. If it gets too cold, we turn on the heater or put on a coat and we’re perfectlyfine. [clip from Groundhog Day: Phil Connors, “Bundle up warm, of course, but I think you canleave your galoshes at home.”]When thinking about climate change in that framework, as our technology develops asenvironments get more extreme, technically, we’ll have the ability to buffer ourselvesagainst it. But, in reality, we have to think about how those resources are partitioned, andso on and so forth. If we think about the recent polar vortex that passed through theMidwest, homeless populations in Chicago are not buffering themselves against that sort ofextreme.Here in Los Angeles, if you think about things like urban heat island effect, especially in themiddle of the city, in the middle of the summer, where you can have temperaturesapproach 100°, maybe even more. I mean, those are populations that can’t bufferthemselves against those sorts of extremes. Even the political situation now, all the debategoing on about building the border wall, one of the things that we forget are the biologicalconsequences of these political actions. “Prevention by deterrence,” is typically what it’scalled. This is Clinton-era border protection philosophy.But essentially what that means is that you’re intentionally funneling human beings outinto the most extreme thermal climates on the planet, into deserts. So, the Arizona Desert,the Sonoran, the Chihuahuan deserts, these are really extreme environments, both in termsof temperature and in terms of water availability. One of the ways that we as mammals coolourselves is through what we call evapotranspiration – sweating. Sweat gets wicked awayand it cools us, but that costs us water. And if you’re trying to make your way through aplace that’s really hot and you don’t have any water, it makes for this sort of doublejeopardy.One of the most recent projects that I picked up with some collaborators of mine atUniversity of Idaho and another lab who will soon be here at UCLA is actually doingphysiological modeling of energy expenditure of undocumented migrants trying to crossthe desert, trying to understand exactly how stressful this is and how much energy isneeded to perform these sort of extreme migration events.16Aside: Shane says that this research he’s doing is one of the more unique applications ofthermophysiology that he’s attempted to undertake in his career, and that a borderbetween, say, Mexico and the US, is a corridor for many species to move and that migrationis extremely important.Shane: It’s one thing to think about this in evolutionary terms, but one thing that we know aboutevolution - evolution by natural selection - is that it comes at a cost, and that cost is death.If you think about surviving these sort of extreme migration events in terms of humans, I’dlike to think that we’ve gotten to a point as a contemporary society where human life isparamount. If human life is paramount, then this idea of evolution by natural selectiondoesn’t really apply because the cost of that evolution should be too high.Alie: Exactly. Is there anything anyone can do to assist that? I’ve seen pictures of people pouringwater out in the desert. Is there anything a layperson could do?Shane: Hmm. Vote?Alie: Yeah. [sighs]Shane: I mean honestly, I think that’s the most important tool any of us has when we’re talkingabout making this level of change.Aside: So yes, vooote. Vote, vote, vote, vote! Shoot, I forgot to ask him about those littlemoss piglet water bears that are more tough than all the Harley riding, leather clad,tattooed dudes combined. Sorry dudes. Tardigrades kick your ass.Shane: How do tardigrades survive? I actually do not know. They are extremophiles and I do knowwhat they can survive, which is crazy.Alie: What can they survive?Shane: They can survive temperatures near absolute zero.Alie: [high pitched voice] Hoooooow?Shane: Through extreme desiccation. They can stay desiccated for a very long time. They cansurvive the vacuum of space. They’re found naturally all the way from in hot springs to thetop of the Himalayas. They can survive extreme UV radiation exposure. They’re nature’sbadass.Alie: Are they Martians?Shane: They might be! [laughs]Alie: That’d be great.Shane: Phylogenetically speaking, we know they nest within life on Earth, but I like to think thatthey could be Martians if we put them there.Alie: [laughs] That’s true, I’m sure they’d be like, “I LOVE IT!” They’d be fine! I feel like they’rethe kind of person you could take to any party and they’ll make friends. You know what Imean?Shane: Oh yeah, definitely.Alie: “Here’s my cousin, Tardigrade, he’s fine. Oh! You already made a friend? Okay, cool.”Shane: “Hang out by the hydrothermal vent? Yeah, do your thing. Imma go over here to theHimalayas real quick to hang out. I’ll be right back.”17Alie: I love it. So adaptable!Lightning round, are you ready?Shane: Ooh, lightning round. Let’s do it.Alie: Okay, here’s the deal. Number one: laser printers, so much more effective than an inkjet. Igot a laser printer, which is helpful because this was 22 pages of questions for you.Shane: You have a bible worth of questions right now. It’s like, full New and Old Testament.Aside: Okay, so on to Patreon questions. But before those, I do share a few words fromour sponsors. Also, a portion of the ad revenue goes to a cause of the Ologist’s choosing.This week, Shane picked the Environmental Defense Fund, which is a non-profit thattackles urgent threats with practical solutions. So thanks, Shane, for choosing that. That’sthe Environmental Defense Fund. Now, usually I call a few listeners, but I just found out I’msupposed to do fresh recordings per episode. I spent a few hours doing each one, soinstead, I’m just gonna tell you about some stuff I’ve been using by companies that I likethat support Ologies. But, BFF tier Patrons, don’t worry. I’ve still randomly been calling youjust to chat and leave you weird voicemails. They’re just not ads. Just saying hi. Alright,your questions!Okay, some ads, in which I’ve hidden some weird factoids.[Ad Break]All right, your questions.Alie: So many people asked the same questions and I’m just gonna read through their namesbecause I kind of categorized them. Okay, Megan Younce, Sarah Clark, Anna Thompson, andAshley Kelly all kind of want to know: Can people have different set body temperatures oris it total BS when someone says that they run hot and someone else runs cold?Shane: No, there is variation in average body temperatures.Alie: Oh! So, when we say a human being should be 98.6°, that means that just like any bellcurve, that’s the top of the bell curve.Shane: Yeah, I think most humans typically fluctuate between 97° and 98.5° or 99°.Alie: Okay! Alright! I always think thermometers are broken because mine show that I’m just acorpse. Am I dead? Did I die?Shane: No, no, there’s variations. Also, there are all sorts of different things that can influence whatwe call thermogenesis, how much heat you’re producing. When we get sick, we get fevers,and that obviously elevates our body temperature. But conditions like anemia or othersituations can actually lead to depressed thermogenesis because you can have a depressedmetabolic rate.Alie: Oh! That leads me to a question by a few different listeners. Areologist, who studies Mars,who was on this show, Jennifer Buz, and Suki Hawley both want to know: What’s the pointof fevers?Shane: Oh, what’s the point of fevers?Alie: Why do we get ‘em?18Shane: The point of fevers is more or less the same point of the Japanese bee heat balls. We havethings that are attacking our body, and by generating a fever we’re hedge betting that weare more heat tolerant than the things that are invading our body.Alie: So, if you have a fever you should keep it up?Shane: No, not necessarily. First of all, you should see a doctor is what you should do. Not a PhD.You should see a medical doctor, not a thermophysiologist.Alie: Do not just tweet at Shane.Shane: No, don’t tweet at me, go see a doctor. I don’t have anything for you over here. Don’t @ me.[laughter]Alie: But that’s why you’re getting it. It’s just cooking the bugs.Shane: Yeah, but at the same time, if you maintain a fever for a really long time, it can actually haveextremely detrimental effects.Alie: You cook your own brain.Shane: Yes, precisely. And cells, generally speaking.Alie: Ooooh. Don’t poach yourself. Okay.Shane: Don’t do that.Alie: But at least you know why it happens. A few people had a question about their partnershaving different heat tolerances than them. Bethany G. says: Why are women so muchcolder in office buildings than men? Generally speaking. [laughs] Cassy Flint asked thesame question: Disclaimer – sorry for the sweeping gender generalization, but why do menseem to be walking heaters? Kelli Meeker also asked this. So did Anna Thompson.Shane: If I had to make a guess at this, I would say it has to do with body size. On average, menhave a tendency to be larger than women – sexual size dimorphism. What that means isthat they have more volume-to-surface area, which then means that they can retain heatmore efficiently than smaller-bodied individuals. Of course, this is regardless of gender. It’sjust a property of size, but because there are different distributions of size for men andwomen, on average it can create that shift.Alie: So, tinier people are not just bigger whiners. They’re actually colder.Shane: Yes.Alie: So, listen to us! Sometimes if you’re short and cold…Shane: They physiologically have to work harder to keep their heat.Alie: Yes, because as a person who’s shorter and has been freezing and worn fingerless gloves inan office building in August, [Shane laughs] I understand that very much. Erica Smith,Margaret Ebacher-Rini, Bob White, and Christine Thompson all kind of wanna know: Doesgenealogy play any part in our preferences for hold or cold weather?Shane: Hmmm. That’s actually a complicated question because genealogy has both a genetic and acultural component. I think the answer in either case can be yes. Thermogenesis or thermalpreferences, just like any trait, can have a distribution. Very few traits are fixed whereevery individual has the exact same value. There’s typically a distribution, a bell curve.These sorts of things can be heritable. I spent most of my life studying lizards. We knowthat thermal tolerance and also thermal preference changes between species and even 19between populations. That is a function of genealogy. There’s no reason to think that wewould behave any differently.Alie: It’s interesting though, if you live in a climate you hate and you hate where you live, go to aclimate you like. If you have kids, chances are they’ll dig the climate too. You know what Imean? You love Florida? Go have some babies in Florida! They’re gonna be like, “I love this,Mom!” You’re like, “I know, right?” Or maybe they’ll hate it.Shane: “It’s the best. Thanks, Mom!”Alie: “Thanks, Mom!” My whole family is still in California and I feel like if you took anyone in myfamily and put us in Boston, we would just be like, “Noooooo!” Just no. Could not deal.Okay. Many people have this question, including the wonderful Skype a Scientist, ToddMcLaren, Joyclyn Vincent, Ivey Crutchfield, Chris Hubbard, Alina Pritchett, Jamie Cattanach,Jessie Cole, Charity, Abbey Harrison, and Kitti Halverson all had the same question: Why doI turn into a human furnace when I sleep? Why can’t we regulate our body temperaturewhen we sleep? Why do we wake up or stick a foot out? When animals sleep, what happenswith their body temperature?Shane: I actually don’t know if I know the answer to this question.Alie: Neither do I!Shane: Yeah, because I also get super sweaty in the middle of the night. It’s kind of absurd.Alie: [laughs] Sleeping on a huge kitchen sponge.Shane: [laughs] Yeah, basically.Alie: Man-sized kitchen sponge!Shane: That’s a special kind of nasty right there.Alie: [laughs] But I talked to the sleep expert, the somnologist, and he said that we sleep betterin colder temperatures and it might be because we just evolved to be out of doors more. So,we know that when the temperature dips we sleep better, but a lot of times we have fitfulsleep if you’re sleeping in too hot of a room which, guilty as charged. I’ll look into it.Shane: I think insulation might play a role because people still like to sleep with blankets, just assort of a comfort thing. But that adds a lot of insulation.Alie: That’s a good point. Even in the summer, if I don’t even have a light sheet on me I’m like, “Ineed a cover of some sort. I need a wisp of gauze over me!”Shane: Even that thin layer creates a pocket of your people air. It’s like you’re basking in your ownjuices, so to speak.Alie: Your ‘Hooman cloud,’ if you will.Aside: So, side note, if your temperature feels all wonky, you can thank your glands. Thehypothalamus acts as a thermostat. It helps your body adjust to whatever your heat needsare. Typically when you’re asleep your temperature drops to its lowest point a few hoursbefore you wake up, which kind of keeps you comfortably snoozing. Now if you’re sweatinga bunch, it could be hormonal changes that are messing with your hypothalamus, or asudden plummet in blood sugar if you kinda went a little hard on the desserts. Also, ifyou’re always freezing and you feel tired and sluggish, you may wanna have your own one-20on-one Ologies episode with an endocrinologist to chat about thyroid levels. Anothersymptom of that: having freezing hands and feet. Which I know for a fact, some of you do.Alie: A lot of people had questions about extremities and parts of the body like Joyclyn Vincent,Marisa Brewer, Mariko Shinn, Meag, Megan Younce, Heather Hutchison, Radha Vakharia,Heather Wills, Asriel King, and Moritz Latuske all kind of asked: Why are feet freezing whilethe rest of our body is warm? Why are our hands cold? What is happening with differentparts of bodies?Shane: This phenomenon is called regional heterothermy.Alie: Ooh! These are great terms!Shane: Thermophysiology has some awesome terms. I do like that part about being athermophysiologist. Essentially what happens is, your body has priorities and your core isthe top priority. If you’re in a cold environment and you need to preserve heat, one of thefirst things that your body does is it shunts blood away from your extremities in order topreserve it at your core, because the same thing would happen as I talked about with theelephants. As they pump blood out it cools and then it returns but if you’re in a coldenvironment and you’re pumping blood to your extremities and it cools and comes back,then your internal body temperature begins to plummet much quicker. So, your feet getcold and your hands get cold so that your heart, and lungs, and liver, and all that good stuffcan stay warm.Alie: Because we gotta keep all those organs pumping, but we can lose a hand, we’ll be fine,right?Shane: Yeah, but at the same time, you notice that if you’re out in the cold, your head is alwayssteaming even though it’s technically an extremity. That’s because that’s where the moneymaker is – the brain. [cash register ding]Alie: Do we lose a lot of heat from our heads?Shane: Yes.Alie: Oh my god, okay. Let me find who asked this again. Claudius and others asked: I’ve heardit’s an urban myth that we lose most of our body heat in your head. Time to have an expertbe the judge, they say.Shane: It’s not an urban legend for multiple reasons. One, because technically when we wearclothes, our head is least likely to be covered. So just as a product, we would lose most ofthe heat by way of our head because the rest of us is insulated.Aside: This is another great time to not imagine your friend’s grandpa walking around ina ski hat and no pants.Shane: The other thing is that this regional heterothermy doesn’t really apply to your headbecause your body will do pretty much anything to keep your brain functioning. You’llcontinue to pump blood to your head, which means you’re continually supplying warmth toyour entire head, your face, except for like your lips and all the cartilaginous places. In thecold, your lips and nose and ears get really...Alie: Purple?Shane: Yeah, exactly. Well, they get purple on you. Not so much on me because of the melanin.[laughs]21Aside: I drink one iced tea and I’m Rose floating on wreckage. I’m Jack Nicholson in adead-end hedge maze. [clip from Titanic: Rose Dawson, “Jack. There’s a boat. Jack!”]Alie: So many people, Cara Fiacco, Todd McLaren, Michael Peskura, Joshua Kuhn, Aleina Tanabe,and Katie Boyd all wanna know about acclimation: Over time does the body adapt toclimate?As a person who lives in Southern California that gets very cold everywhere else, and asyou’ve just moved here, just wait ‘til it happens to you. [Shane laughs] You’ll start gettingweaker and weaker. Do we adapt that quickly?Shane: Individuals can acclimate to temperatures. Again, I study this mostly in reptiles, but inreptiles and ectotherms, we call it, ‘heat hardening’. Essentially, when you’re exposed to ahot temperature for an extended period of time, you become more adept at functioning athigh temperatures and vice versa. This is called acclimation or phenotypic plasticity. Wehave one genome that can produce multiple phenotypes depending on its interaction withthe environment.Alie: Oh, really? So, you can kinda switch off what you need?Shane: Yeah, so for instance if you or I were to go up to high altitude, our bodies wouldphysiologically change. We’d begin to produce more red blood cells, what we callerythropoiesis. It’s the same genome. Genetically we haven’t changed, but the way that ourbody is sensing the environment induces a change. The same is true in response totemperature.Alie: Oh my god. That’s crazy! I didn’t realize that! So, I am getting weaker by living in SouthernCalifornia.Shane: Probably. [laughs]Alie: It’s 100% for sure. I go anywhere else and I’m like, “Eeewwww.” Mac, Armando Trujillo,and Mae Merrill all kinda asked about adipose tissue. Mac asked: How significant is theactivation of brown/beige adipocyte thermogenesis as far as raising total bodytemperature is concerned? Then, Armando and Mae both said that they recently lost a lot ofweight and they’re constantly cold. Does weighing less affect body heat?Shane: Weighing less does affect body heat, again, because of this volume-to-surface area. But also,fat, generally speaking, does also act as an insulator. A lot of mammals that occur in polarclimates – things like polar bears, walruses, seals that can live in really cold waters - theyall have blubber, which is fat.Alie: They’re so cute! They’re little chunks!Shane: Yeah, more cushion for the pushin’! [clip from Spinal Tap, Big Bottom: “The bigger thecushion, the sweeter the pushin’.”]Alie: [laughter] Arctic chonks! The cutest! They are scientifically cuter.Shane: Scientifically speaking.Alie: Yeah, I’m just sayin’ an arctic chubbalubber is gonna be cuter than a seal with a six-pack.Shane: Chubby things do have a tendency to be cute.Alie: They’re so cute! But if you’ve lost a lot of weight, you might be a little cold. Get a sweater.One of them asked: Is there any way to alleviate that without gaining the weight back, lol? Ithink, Armando, just get a sweater. Get a hoodie. You deserve it.22Shane: This ability to buffer ourselves is one of the reasons why we’re still here. It’s called theBogert Effect.Alie: The Bogert Effect?Shane: Yeah, this ability to thermally buffer yourself.Alie: That means get a sweater. [laughs] There should be a Bogert sweater company. A Bogertsweater mercantile. Sam F wants to know: Okay, frogs (or are they toads?) that basicallysuspend all their bodily functions and to the external observer appear dead to deal withcold and then when you thaw them out, they’re just alive all of a sudden. What the hell is upwith that? How do we get that?Shane: Yeah, those are the wood frogs.Alie: Those are the wood frogs!Shane: Those are the wood frogs.Alie: There you go, Sam!Aside: So, yes, those are the froggers with the antifreeze blood. I was actually able totrack down audio of their mating call, which is really cool. Sounds like this: [clip fromFrozen: Elsa, “The cold never bothered me anyway.”] JK, it’s actually this: [three rapid, clickychirp sounds]Also, I’m sorry but I had to share an important life experience with Shane because he’s aprofessional in the matter.Alie: I’ll tell you a quick story. My dad is from Montana. Love Montana. I had a hamster and forsome reason the hamster was outside and it got very cold and I woke up and the hamsterwas frozen solid.Shane: Ohhhh….Alie: Like a chicken cutlet. And my Dad was like, “Don’t worry, rodents like this, they do this andthey hibernate. I’m from Montana. Come on.” I was like, “Really?” He’s like, “Yeah, they justwarm up.” I was like, “Okay.” I got back from school and my hamster, Bacon, was fine and Iwas like, “Oh my god, that is crazy that rodents can do that!” Anyway, cut to 20 years laterat Thanksgiving when I mentioned it and my dad is like, “Ohhh...” He had gone out on hislunch break and just gotten a new hamster! [laughs]Shane: I was hoping that I didn’t have to break that to you here, on this microphone. [laughs]Alie: Two decades! I was like, “Bacon bounced back!” My dad just went out on his lunch break!Shane: And he lived for 47 years! Best hamster ever!Alie: His spots kept changing. They do that!Shane: It’s an acclimation effect!Alie: I know! His face though, when I looked over and I was like, “Oh no!”Okay, cryogenics. Sonya Karlepovic [phonetic] and Asriel King want to know: Is cryogenicfreezing in any way realistic or possible?Shane: It depends on what you mean. In terms of Walt Disney-style cryogenics…Aside: Side note, a few of Walt Disney’s biographers say he was keenly interested in thefuture, see Tomorrowland, and that he knew about cryogenics. But Disney’s daughter 23denies that he is in suspended animation awaiting a thaw. Also, his cremation report is onfile. But hear me out – that could’ve been for his body without his money maker. Knowwhat I’m saying? But Walt, either way, I trust you did whatever it was that you wanted todo. Also, I will never think of the show Disney on Ice quite the same.Shane: I’m always reluctant to say anything is impossible, but it’s highly improbable. If you’retalking about cryogenic freezing, this is actually a really active area of research when itcomes to things like organ transplants and extending the longevity of transplants and howlong they can survive outside of the body. Actually, a lot of this work is being done onanimals like the wood frog. If you have an animal that is able to do this for an extendedperiod of time and have properly functioning organs, that’s a good place to go to findsolutions to being able to freeze an organ solid and then revive it and still have it be able tofunction.I do think that is a possibility. Essentially, we just need to really know more about thephysiology of this process and how it plays out in nature. But, in terms of freezing headsand reviving people – improbable, I will say. Highly improbable.Alie: But I mean – most questions I’ve ever had. 191 questions.Shane: Wow! That’s amazing. I feel special.Alie: You should feel special! People were excited! Okay, what sucks the most about your job, orabout your pursuit, or the cold, or the heat? What sucks the most about being athermophysiologist?Shane: Hmm... That is a good question. What sucks the most?Alie: When people come to your office and ask you stupid questions for a podcast!Shane: No, that’s one of the best parts! Especially because a lot of the times I’m that person that’sbothering the scientist about their work. [laughs] You get a lot less slack when you are alsoa scientist, I must say.Aside: Again, he, a scientist, interviews other scientists for his incredible podcast, TheBiology of Superheroes. Okay. So, what sucks?Shane: Two things: one is the sort of mundane everyday stuff. I have yet to meet the biologistwhere you ask them, “Why did you get into biology?” And they’re like, “Man, I just loveanswering emails, and typing up memos, and responding to administrative stuff. Mm!That’s just the best!” No one says that. But that has become such a huge part of my life. Notthe best.As a thermophysiologist, you have to put yourself under some extreme thermal conditionsas well. I spend summers driving around the South. In Florida and the southern tip ofTexas, Louisiana, it gets really hot and really muggy in the heat of the day. But if the lizardsare out doing their thing, you gotta be out there doing your thing, and sometimes it’s just amiserable existence. Every once in a while I will take my research team to just go see amovie in an air-conditioned movie theatre right at the heat of the day when it’s even toohot for the lizards.Alie: Are you teaching them about Bogert’s effect?Shane: The Bogert effect. [laughs] Yeah, exactly. We call it a lesson.Alie: “We’re going to experience a 62° movie theatre right now.” Is it worse when it’s muggybecause your sweat can’t evaporate as much?24Shane: Yeah, evapotranspiration is not efficient in really highly humid environments. That’s whypeople who live in Tucson or other places in Arizona are like, “Oh yeah, it’s 150 but it’s adry heat.” I’m like, “What does a dry heat have to do with anything? It’s still heat!” But inactuality, because it’s so dry, evapotranspiration does help to more efficiently cool thebody. I still think it’s horrible though.Alie: What is the best thing about being a thermophysiologist?Shane: Oh my god. How much time do you have?Alie: Lizaaaaaards.Shane: Yeah. It’s definitely the animals. Certainly, being a thermophysiologist - and I think thisapplies to pretty much any scientist - but the idea of waking up in the morning and youknow that your day is going to be spent trying to answer questions that have never beenanswered before and may have never been asked before, there’s just something so deeplysatisfying about that. Obviously, being in the field, those WTF moments when you’re goingout and maybe it’s super hot outside and you’re kinda tired, and then you see somethingthat you’ve never seen or thought about before and it just sparks something like, “WTF!What in the good hell was that?”Just being there, putting yourself in that environment, it’s a whole different frame of mind.We spend our entire lives making all kinds of decisions that don’t have any realconsequences in terms of life and death. So, to be able to go and put yourself in anenvironment and observe organisms where the decisions that they’re making aren’t, “Oh,what pair of Converses should I put on,” but, “Do I move here or there? Do I do this orthat?” That decision can literally be the difference between finding food and being food,and how that plays out in populations over time.Being able to see this grand story of evolution played out on this thermo-hydric stage andhow it’s played out over millennia. Seeing all the different ways and all the differentsolutions that life has come up with to solve those problems. Darwin called this, “Endlessforms most beautiful.” Being able to partake in that process in such a tangible way as ascientist, it’s the thing that really just drives me. Plus, the toys.Alie: [laughs] What kind of toys do you have!?Shane: Oh my god. Running lizards on racetracks. I’ll take you up there. I just had these twobeautiful, amazing environmental chambers built that allows us to manipulate temperaturelike, every half hour, and manipulate humidity. I call them the twins: Chuck D and Alfie.Aside: Okay, so, side note: these environmental chambers he just got, Chuck D and Alfie,are named after Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace, who are two naturalists whoconceived the theory of evolution. If you haven’t heard Evolutionary Biology yet, nowwould be a good time.Alie: Are there lizards in them?Shane: There are not lizards in them yet, but there will be lizards in them very soon.Alie: Are you gonna have grad students manning the lizard chambers?Shane: Yes. It’s gonna be the best. I’m so excited!Aside: Of course, being a professor isn’t all he’s working on.Alie: And your podcast, which is amazing. It’s just so good!25Shane: Oh, thank you. It is nerdgasmic. [Alie laughs] It’s one of those guilty pleasures to be able tomerge the nerd multiverse, bringing in the comic books and the science. It’s awesome. It’sbeen a lot of fun.Alie: What episodes do you have coming up?Shane: We just put out a Star Trek episode looking at evolution and genetics in Star Trek. Weinterviewed Dr. Mohamed Noor who is an evolutionary geneticist at Duke. The nextepisode will be about the Immortal Iron Fist, talking about the biology of a living weapon. Iinterview someone who studies biomechanics. She studies this amazing, amazing creature,the mantis shrimp. Its punch is one of the fastest motions recorded in the animal world.There’s a lot of science, a lot of really cool stuff that we talk about there.Alie: Oh my god, it’s so good! I’m so excited! Thank you so much for letting me barge into youroffice with 22 pages of questions.Shane: Oh my goodness! I love you and your bible full of questions.Alie: Thank you so much for doing this!Shane: Of course! This is a lot of funIt’s the ghost of the succulent plant you somehow killed, just incredulously staring atyou like, "How? How!? I'm a cactus." Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. Okay, sodon’t galaxy brain too hard but each word I’m saying has a history, and a lifespan, and a backstory,and was probably born out of a grunt and then went through pubescence in another languagespelled with too many vowels. And if you sat down and listened to its biography you’d likely love iteven more. But, before we get into backstories and etymologies, a few complex words of thanks:Thanks to everyone supporting on Patreon. This show and these audio files you’ve downloaded forfree would not exist without the folks giving as little as a buck a month on Patreon.com/Ologies.Thank you to everyone buying merch at OlogiesMerch.com. Thanks to everyone who checks tomake sure you’re subscribed and for spending an actual nanosecond just rating the podcast and aminute or two or three leaving reviews for me to creepily enjoy when I am feeling like a bucket ofold oatmeal with a mouth. Which happens.This week, Smacksmooresheemsmaam says:This podcast is fantastic for getting myself through boring car rides and long days at work.The host, my father, Alie Ward, is captivating and asks her guests all of the right questions.Now for some reason, "The host, my father, Alie Ward" had me actually cackling out loud when Iread it.Also, DJLiz13, I creeped your review about your late father and it got me teary and I'm sending youhugs.Okay! Etymology. Oh, I have wanted to cover this topic since the day I first laid eyes on a list ofologies back in 2002. So strong is my thirst. I include some etymology in every episode, you knowthat. But what’s the etymology of etymology?? This is like your mirror image staring at your realface. Or one hand washing the other. So, etymology comes from the Greek ‘etumos’ meaning truth.This ologist studied English and language at St. Catherine’s College and the University of Oxford,England and went on to become a writer, co-host of the long-running comedy podcast Answer MeThis. Then she began a linguistics and etymology podcast called, The Allusionist in 2015. She'sknown as The Etymological Lodger and I had so many people send drooly, feverish messages that Ishould interview her about word origins. And I said to myself, and them, "Sure! Right! How aboutif I also interview Beyoncé while I'm at it! I can't get her!"But somehow I was able to get her attention via Twitter and convince her to come to my home, akamy apartment, and hang out on my couch for an hour and talk language. To say I like her would bea gross understatement. I'm so into her. She's the best. So, we talk about the fundamental truththat language is always, always changing whether you want it to or not. And about, of course,various word origins, Latin, gender in languages, the bible, aka The Oxford English Dictionary, slang, 2emojis, the pliability of boobs, mediocrity, step parents, babies in glasses, Greek, the Romancelanguages, and more with host of The Allusionist podcast and person who technically for a livingresearches the origins of language and thus is an etymologist, Helen Zaltzman.----------Alie Ward: Do people put an extra L in there a lot?Helen Zaltzman: Uh, no, actually that is not one of the regular spelling mistakes. But they see theZ’s and they panic.Alie: Do you say Z as in zed or zebra?Helen: Well, I say zed when I'm in zed-saying countries. But I'm on your turf, so I've translatedit.Alie: Yeah, look at that! Do you say zebra [phonetic: zeb-ruh]?Helen: I do say zebra [ph. zeb-ruh]. Is it zebra [ph. zeeb-ruh] here?Alie: Yeah.Helen: Ah, yeah. So, okay, here's my rubric for when I'm in the States. If it's a different wordlike zed, zee or coriander, cilantro, I'll say the different word. But it is harder for me touse the correct American pronunciation if it's the same word. So it's hard for me to saytomato [ph. toe-may-toe] because it sounds just wrong when I say it. I can't do itproperly. My mouth won't form a proper American shape to do the word properly.[“Tomato, [ph. toe-may-toe] tomato, [ph. toe-mah-toe] oh let’s call the whole thing off.” -Fred Astaire in Shall We Dance, 1937.]Alie: Tomato [ph. toe-may-toe].Helen: Tomato [ph. toe-may-toe]. It's stupid isn't it?Alie: Tomato [ph. toe-mah-toe] sounds so much fancier.Helen: I don't know, I think...Alie: It does.Helen: It's not even an English word! We got it from South America.Aside: Quick aside, the word tomato comes from the Nahuatl, a language of what’sknown historically as the Aztec Empire, for, ‘the swelling fruit.’ And thus, a tomato iswhat people called a hot girl in the 1920s. Language experts think this was due toplump, juicy connotations. Now, as long as we’re just starting this out on the horniest 3foot, another fun produce aisle conversation you can have loudly is that avocado comesfrom the Nahuatl for testicle.Alie: Now, how long have you been interested in language?Helen: I remember first becoming interested in language when I was fairly small. I was, I think,seven. I went to a very old fashion school so I started learning French and Latin at avery young age. I was like, "Oh, that word seems similar to this word in English." And, itwas a bit like when you see Homeland or something where someone's got a wall withlots of newspaper clippings joined together with string.[clip from Homeland, season 1, episode 11, Carrie: "You understand…” Saul: “It's atimeline."]So, it's like, "Ahhh, I wonder what these things have got in common." And also I grewup in quite a verbose household. I was the youngest. I was an accident. ["whoopsie!”]There's quite a bit of time between me and my elder brothers who are both very wittyand good at talking. And I just thought, if I'm gonna say anything then I really have tobring my A game. It was just a form of survival to be verbally deft from a young age.Alie: Did you talk early?Helen: I don't know because I don't think anyone was paying attention. But apparently I wasan early reader. My mum says I was an early reader, but I remember her teaching me toread. So, I think before that I was just looking at books with the appearance of reading.Alie: They’re like, “Why's she wearing bifocals? She's two.”Helen: I did have glasses from one and a half! How did you know??Alie: DID YOU?? REALLY??Helen: Yeah, not bifocals until I was fourteen. Yeah, it was… [laughs] There are not manypictures of my childhood.Alie: Reeeeeally?Helen: Yeah, I had these pink plastic thick glasses. And then sometimes they'd put a Band-Aidover one lens to strengthen the other eye. But they used to put it over my eye, but thenripping it off is quite painful. It's a good time.Alie: Babies in glasses are the cutest babies.Helen: Sort of. I think glasses styles have improved.Alie: No, babies in glasses are always cute.Helen: Is it like babies that look like angry little old men, who look like old codgers, maybe?4Alie: Yes exactly!Helen: That's a good fun.Alie: They're a kinder-codger.Helen: Yeah. Like a baby wearing a tiny bow tie.Alie: Yes! I guess like an old man in a diaper with a pacifier isn't as cute, but when youreverse it, it's good. You know?Helen: [laughs] It's so unfair.Alie: So, now when did you start making language your living? When did you start writingprofessionally? When did you start getting into etymology as a career?Helen: Well, I studied some at university. I did an English degree, but I did this special coursethat only 15 people did in the whole university and it stopped at 1400.Aside: Again, she took an English language course that stopped at the year 1400.Just imagine! The vellum! The ancient diphthongs! The deteriorated antiquities! Whydid it stop at 1400?Helen: You're never going to find anything original to say about Shakespeare, and there's muchless to read, which frees up more time for doing extracurriculars. But also there was alot of emphasis on Old and Middle English, which I always found very interesting andthere's a certain clarity in the literature. They got to the point, like, “it's a religiousallegory… it's a bawdy limerick… we're going to die at 35 just stick to the point.” It'sover simplifying and yet there’s, kind of, the truth there.So, I was very interested in it at university and then, just afterwards a dream etymologyjob came up at The Oxford English Dictionary. [heavenly angels singing] So, I applied forit and only got to the second round. [record scratch] I didn't get very far in because nowI know what's involved in being a dictionary etymologist. I realize that I would havebeen extremely ill suited because that is a job that requires a lot of precision, a lot ofdispassion. You're supposed to write dictionary entries with very little character in.They're supposed to be, kind of, authoritative, but not jaunty, not funny. And, you haveto be so methodical and I'm not methodical at all.Alie: So, not a lot of room for pizzazz.Helen: No, except for the entry for pizzazz, if they have enough written citations for pizzazz.[laughs]Aside: Pizzazz, of course meaning style or flair, vitality. Now, this word emerged inthe 1930s, etymologists think from showbiz slang. But for me, pizzazz will forever betied to the Mexican Pizza at Taco Bell, which was first introduced decades ago as yes, a 5Pizzazz Pizza. [clip from Taco Bell ad, circa 1985: “Get struck by the never before taste ofPizzazz Pizza.”] I will always remember my Mom having to hang her head out the carwindow and scream into the order box, [as if over a bad speaker: "A Pizzazz… A PizzazzPizza!"] When they changed the name to Mexican Pizza, something inside me died. I'vebeen sad about it for decades. I mourned.Okay, also, Helen studied English at Oxford, so word origins, language, et cetera... Andthen she says she didn't really do anything with that for about another 12 years whenshe started The Allusionist. But on Answer Me This, they get a lot of word originquestions throughout the year, so she was flexing that proverbial muscle all along.Alie: Did you know when you were getting your degree that you wanted to go into historicallanguage? Did you know that etymology maybe was something you wanted to do?Helen: It just didn't seem like a plausible thing to do, but also I'm very bad at thinking ahead, soI wasn't really thinking much beyond it. When I was little I was like, "I just want to getto university." Because it felt like freedom. And then when I was there I was just verymuch enjoying being there ‘cause it was like freedom. And I was like, “You'll just dealwith the job stuff afterwards.” And, then that took a decade.Aside: So an etymologist may be a linguist, a dictionary writer, a podcaster aboutlanguage and also even a murderer, as detailed in Simon Winchester's book, TheProfessor and the Madman, which is about the compilation of The Oxford EnglishDictionary that began in 1857. It was led by a Professor by the name of James Murray.And the overseeing committee was like, “Man, one person, Dr. W. C. Minor, hassubmitted over 10,000 entries and etymologies. We should send him, like, a muffinbasket or a thank you. What a badass!” Then they found out Dr. Minor was a Civil Wardoctor who became an inmate in an asylum for the criminally insane. And then theywere like, “Hmmmmm... We're still going to use these definitions though. That’s cool.”Helen: So, one of the very important compilers of The Oxford English Dictionary was a guy whowas in prison for murder. But he had a lot of time to sort through written citations ofwords, because they still have to go off written citations of things to prove that the wordexisted, and the time that it existed, and that it means the things that you think it means,and they can demonstrate that. They just have to be able to demonstrate everythingwith written citations. They collect loads and loads of written examples for words. Andalso they have to prove that it's important enough and in sustained usage for longenough.So, it's not like you could provide a hundred written citations for a word you've justmade up and it would immediately catch on. [clip from Mean Girls: “That is so fetch.”]But if you could get it to catch on and enough other people to use it, could get it in thedictionary, Alie!Alie: GASP!6Helen: Little project!Aside: Okay, so some of the OED's added words this year, by the by, were, TGIF,Burkini, and haterade. Some interesting choices.Alie: Do you keep up with the OED each year, with the new words added?Helen: No, ‘cause I think that's usually a press release game, don't you? Because they just wantto annoy people with that, often.Alie: That's a good point. They're usually the most annoying words.Helen: Yes, exactly. They know they're trolling people.Alie: Oh god, that's so sinister and wonderful.Helen: Yeah, I like the relish with which a lot of the dictionaries have taken to the social mediaage. A lot of them have very salty Twitter accounts.Alie: Oh god, yes.Helen: And you learn some good words, but also the print edition of dictionaries, there's a limitto the number of words they can put in there. So, some have to go. It's difficult forwords to enter, but there's a lot of room on the Internet so they can track those words,and something that may only be briefly useful, like, “On fleek” that can enter thedictionary quickly, but it doesn't necessarily have to stay there if it was just a few yearsof on fleekness.Alie: On fleek sounds so much better coming with a British accent. [laughs]Helen: I only ever say in quotation marks. [computer voice: “Eyebrows on fleek”] I've nevermanaged to say it in an actually descriptive way.Alie: I don't think anyone other than the original vine poster. [Peaches Monroe: “Eyebrows onfleek.”]Helen: Peaches Monroe.Alie: Is that what her name is?!Helen: Yeah.Alie: Good job! How do you know that?!Helen: Well, [laughs] I have studied the etymology of “on fleek.”Alie: That’s why you’re the best!7Helen: Oh Gosh. But yeah, I'm too old to say it without quotation marks.Alie: Yeah, we all are.Helen: [laughs]Alie: Now, at what point did you get the idea for The Allusionist? How did that develop?Helen: Right, well, around 2014, I just had the idea of doing a show that was called WordDetective. And I was like, what does that mean? So, I worked back a bit, and then myfriend Roman Mars who makes 99% Invisible, had just founded Radiotopia and I knewthat he was interested in getting me to do some stuff. And he came to stay with me inLondon in the summer of 2014. So, while he was jet lagged and vulnerable, I waswalking him around the park and I said, “I've had an idea for a show, it's a bit like yourshow, but for language instead of architecture and design.” And he was like, okay.Aside: So they dug around for the financing, because she wouldn’t have been ableto do Answer Me This, plus The Allusionist, plus handle extra time of a day job. Assomeone who still hasn't mailed Christmas presents, in March, I get this.Helen: Podcasting for the first many years was financially rather painful.Alie: OH SURE!Helen: So, that was how it started. He was like, okay we can make this financially viable. Andalso it was a slightly quieter time and podcasting then.Alie: Yeah, it is quite a din of different shows.Helen: Yes. Certainly very noisy.Alie: And now you must have had a bit of a field day when you were first coming up withwords that you wanted to explore. I mean, how did you decide which words get in?Helen: Well there's a long Google doc with potential ideas that I've had since before the showbegan. And I have done not that many of those ideas because a lot of it is just what can Iactually get done? How can I think to pursue this? Who can I talk with about it? Whowill agree to be on the show or knows about it? What's an angle that is not just going tobe really dry? A lot of it is what am I curious about and what don't I know about.Because if I feel like I know where something's going to go, I'm not very interested inmaking an episode about it. Or if it's very familiar. It's patching up my own ignorance.But, I am a team of one! So actually, although it was pitched as an etymology show, ithasn't really been a lot about that because what it turns out I'm far more interested in ishuman behavior and how things are applicable now. Like, what's resonant to peoplenow.8Aside: So rather than being a historian, Helen prefers to look into the current usageof words and terms and how they kinda roll around our brains and out of our face.Helen: And then it's finding bits of information to give to people. And so, it's gone in a verydifferent direction to what I thought. But sometimes I'll have insomnia… I remember Ihad insomnia, and often what I do is, “I wonder whether this word comes from where Ithink it does.” And then if it didn't, I think, “Oh, that's worth making a note of it. It'ssurprising.” So I remember in the first few months of The Allusionist, I thought, "I'll justcheck…” in the night, whether ‘step’ as in stepparent just means you're a step away fromthe biological lineage. And it doesn't, it means grief.Alie: GASP!Helen: I thought, "Ahhh, and if I didn't know that then a lot of listeners are not going to knowthat.” I firstly was trying to get someone to speak who was from a museum of orphansand abandoned children in London because I thought they would be interesting on, like,the history of the family in that respect. And they would not speak to me.Alie: Really??Helen: Yeah. And then I thought I'll do it differently, because you have a lot of wickedstepmothers in folklore. And Aaron Mahnke, from the podcast Lore, we were kind ofinternet friends and I was like, “Would you be interested?” It was just before his showwas, like, really too big for him to be… way too busy to do this. And he came with a lot offascinating research about how you didn't really have a stepparent unless someone haddied because divorce was uncommon and therefore stepparents got a pretty bad rap. Ialso just put a Facebook post up saying, "If you've got feelings about step in your ownfamily existence, just record yourself talking about them."Aside: [clip of man talking: “I’ve got a somewhat complicated family and have severalstepparents. Although I never really call them that. I’ve always just known them as theirfirst name. It can be a bit jarring to explain how you’re related to this person who yourefuse to call your Dad.”]And that was very compelling because a lot of people said, "You know, I'd neverconsciously thought about it and now I have. I think I hate it."Alie: Really?Helen: Yeah. So it was just a very interesting montage to me of how people dealt with thisword as children, or as stepparents, or stepsiblings, or the different words that they use.I think in Sweden, Bonus is the term, which I felt was much more positive.Alie: That is more positive! That's my bonus dad!Helen: Right, right. Much less wickedness. 9Alie: Yeah. You don't think of someone who's getting angry at your tee ball games andsecretly hates you, you know?Helen: Right. Who's just trying to take all of your parents' money and then leave. Kill them andleave.Alie: Like when you look at a house and there is a bonus room and you're like, “so muchpossibility!” More than expected.Helen: Yes. ‘Cause it's a bonus.Alie: It's a bonus!Aside: The word bonus comes from the Latin for bon, a good thing. So, somewherethere is a sweet, nice stepdad driving carpool or a stepmom working her ass off to puttogether a cool birthday party, and y’all, it’s okay to shed a tear about this, bonus folks.You're good.Alie: Now is there something about the elasticity of language? I feel like that's kind of whatwe all love about etymology, but is your interest rooted in human behavior and how wekeep morphing things?Helen: Yes, my interested is very much in human behavior. And I think that's what partly gotme interested in etymology in the first place was just a lot of it is a little idiosyncraticand you can see these signs of how people would have behaved several hundred yearsago. So, there's a lot of mistakes in how words have evolved. It's not necessarily logical.And I think that was appealing that it's not these straight paths. Another thing I learnedabout doing the show was that I'm not a language prescriptivist. I was such a pedantwhen I was a child.Alie: [laughs]Helen: Just a nightmare, particularly to my Mum. But it's unsustainable. When you knowanything about how language behaves, you can't keep it up because there's just so manythings contradicting it. And there's a lot of cognitive dissonance if you want to keep upyour pedantry. But also after a while I was like, "You're carrying around a lot ofpointless anger. It's just not necessary." So that was a positive surprise, I think. It wasjust being amenable to how language is going to change and has always changed,particularly the English language. That has evolved much more rapidly than a lot ofother languages that are deliberately kept the same. But if you know about English,you're like, "Okay, this is what happens." People use it the ways that they need it to beused.So if there is a gap, then people will fill it with either a word that they've decided to usein a different way or they will invent one. [clip from Mean Girls: “Gretchen, stop trying tomake fetch happen!”] A lot of it is driven by that kind of necessity. You can't control it. 10And even if it doesn't necessarily make sense, it's never made sense. You might not likeit, but you have to understand that this is a linguistic process.Alie: Now, what is it about English that has made it evolve so rapidly? And also, havingstudied Latin, where do you see we grab the roots from? Latin? From Greek?Helen: Oh yeah, English is such a mutt of a language, which is why it's so fascinating. It's aproblem as well, which is more to do with its later history. So, English kind of cameabout originally from a bunch of invasions. There were native languages in the BritishIsles, but then there was the Roman invasion, which I think was 50 BC to about 400 AD.And then Germanic forces invaded around 500 AD. And then Vikings. And then in 1066,the Normans. So you've got a lot of French influence but also a lot of Latin throughFrench. And so at that point you had the language of governance being Latin, but thenthe language of posh people being French. And then normal people still speaking AngloSaxon, a Germanic version of Anglo Saxon. And then that kind of coalesces into middleEnglish that then becomes modern English.So, I think about 70% of English words have some Latin roots, but a lot of those Latinroots would've come from Greek or they didn't come directly from the Romans. Andthen you've got, what I call euphemistically, ‘Britain's enthusiastic foreign policy.’[The Price Is Right loser horns, “BUM BUM BAH DUM, WAAAAAH”]So it was not only people coming in and invading the country, it's also us going to otherparts of the world, a lot of other parts of the world and a sticking our dicks in them.Alie: [laughing] Pretty much!Helen: Yeah, so English has happened in lots of different places, but also we found words inthose places and brought them back. Or we brought back things we found like potatoesand thus the word with them. That happens a ton. You've got this very idiosyncraticthing. Whereas French, you've got an academy keeping French the same. They decideon whether you're allowed gender neutral pronouns or whatever. They don't like this.It's very gendered language. Whereas English doesn't have that kind of control and hasresisted that kind of control. They've tried and it hasn't really taken off.Aside: [comedically warped voice] By the way, if you hear something that soundslike vacuuming, it’s because there’s someone outside my door vacuuming. I run a veryprofessional podcast studio here.Helen: It's just vacuuming. People have heard it before.Alie: They've heard it before. So why did Latin steal from Greek so much?Helen: That is a really good question. I think because you had a lot of Greek power before youhad Ancient Roman Empire power. And also there is a lot of cultural crossover. So,there's basically like three parents for most languages. Again, it's just going back to the 11root word and then it being in different locations evolved into slightly different versionsof the words.Alie: And when it comes to finding the root word of something, what's been one of the moresurprising entries, or what are some of your favorite etymologies? Because there's astory behind all of them.Helen: Yes, although frustrating. Often the story is “we don't know.” The pathway doesn't govery far particularly with slangs because they don't have the written citations, so theycan't prove where a slang came from cause it's usually in people's mouths way beforeit's written down. I really liked the etymology of the word ‘mediocre.’ And I don't knowwhy it is, but it means ‘halfway up a jagged hill.’Alie: Really?Helen: Yeah. What an evocative thing.Alie: My god! I never knew that one.Helen: I would have thought to get halfway up a jagged hill you have to be really quite good.Alie: Yeah.Helen: That doesn't seem like an easy path, or the absence of any particular quality. It seemslike a hard climb.Alie: Yeah! How many jagged hills where these people climbing?Helen: I don't know.Alie: It must be quite a lot if ‘you could only get halfway up’ was a burn.Helen: Yeah, “we just scampered right to the top before breakfast.” So I find that veryfascinating and I don't understand why it is. It seems like quite the story.Alie: Yeah, I didn't know that. Have you ever heard the etymology for buxom?Helen: No, that sounds fun.Alie: It's such a good one. This is one of my favorite etymologies. It comes from pliable, andthen compliant, and then friendly, and then beautiful, and then sexy, and then boobs.Helen: Wow. So it wasn't that the boobs were pliable.Alie: No... [laughs]Helen: The person was pliable. That's a sexy trait to some. 12Alie: Evidently. Yeah. So, it’s one of those weird twists and turns, just thinking about ithaving to morph at every stage of the way.Helen: Yeah.Aside: Googling, “Buxom woman” will not, sidenote, get you any returns of pliablebranches. Now, speaking of searches, where does Helen go first to uncover a word'shistory? She says EtymOnline and Dictionary.com are her preferred sources, as she’sconstantly traveling with her husband and she can’t haul around a shelf full of dustyreference books. Come on.Alie: And you're kind of wandering about, which is… what a life. You and your husband.Helen: Ridiculous.Alie: Scientist. Physicist.Helen: Yeah.Alie: I would say that you're traipsing about the continents.Helen: Traipsing. Yeah. Gadding about.Alie: So you bop around...Helen: Yeah, we bop around to different countries.Alie: And, so you're a wandering etymologist.Helen: [laughs]Alie: That's so romantic!Helen: Wandering audio-tainer.Alie: If you would have thought as a college student that you would get to travel the worldwhile doing etymology.Helen: I know, right? Bananas. And getting paid.Alie: Living the dream!Helen: Living the absolute dream.Alie: GASP!Helen: I couldn't even allow myself to have that dream because I'd have though, “I don't wantto be disappointed.” 13Alie: Well, and podcasts didn't exist.Helen: Nope. They did not. [laughs]Alie: When it comes to, like, a goal with etymology, do you feel like with language you can useyour platform to have people see each other differently? Do you ever feel like you canfix some ills of the world with language?Helen: Yeah. When I'm feeling evangelical. So, it is an entertainment show first and foremost,and it's supposed to distract people on a commute, or when they can't sleep, or whenthey're feeling anxious, or whatever. But then it's just when you get into language andyou're thinking about all the different ways that can be used, I think a lot of it is aboutempathy because the more sensitive you become to all that, you become more aware ofyour own usage and how other people might interpret it and the various things theymight mean with their usage.So, it forces you to think about other people more in their communication and theendless variety thereof. And also if you get into your hangups you can often realize thata lot of them are about snobbery or a way of controlling people almost by telling themthat they're saying something in a way you disagree with. And so, removing yourselffrom that, or encouraging other people just to not focus on that, I think that is quiteimportant because it's just more compassionate.Aside: And the etymology of compassionate? It's late Latin for com plus patti, so tosuffer together. And yes, the root of passion is to suffer. But compassion is ‘to feel thepain of others,’ which is terribly moving.Helen: So I'd say that is the more serious thing.Alie: And you mentioned a live show you did recently. It was about gender pronouns andpreferred usage.Helen: Yeah, I've been doing a lot of work about gender in language. That's all festering intosomething and not quite sure what form it will emerge in yet. So, it's about things liketitles like mister and misses and mrrs and gender pronouns. And just how, to me havinggender in the English language doesn't really make much sense. I don't think it'snecessary.Some languages have far less gender, and there are a lot of languages that have nogender pronouns at all, and languages where they don't use titles. And I'm curious toknow whether the absence of those things has any effect on the way that peoplecommunicate with each other or relate to each other. And it's certainly not the case thatlanguages that have no gender pronouns don't have gender imbalance, but I'm justthinking, why don't we default to gender neutrality? And then people can always optinto a gendered pronoun if they want. I feel like it would save a lot of bother if it wasjust default, “They.”14Alie: Yeah, why do you think that there is resistance to that?Helen: That's a really good question. I think some people fear change. And change canconsciously or unconsciously to people be almost insulting because it's like, “you'rewrong” rather than just, “you do a thing and it's not necessarily wrong, but it's notnecessarily the permanent way.” And I think also some people are just not comfortablewith the idea of a different kind of society. I mean, I see this even in myself, whenyou've been raised in this, sort of, very binary gender way and there's certain genderlimits and so on. I felt like I molded a lot of myself to working around the constraints ofthat just to, kind of, optimize the way that I could exist in this thing I didn't really agreewith, and make it as irrelevant to myself as possible. But I couldn't possibly escape it.But then if that crumbles, who am I?There are some people who've adjusted themselves a lot more to living in the patriarchyor whatever and take advantage of that. Male and female. Then if it's taken away, somepeople are like, "Yes, like I feel so freed." And other people are like, "Yeah, who am I andwhat am I supposed to do and how am I supposed to benefit?" Like, they don't knowwhat the benefit is to them of a fairer society because they might think it's not. So, Ithink that is scary to people. And, some people want neat categorization of everything.But I have a lot of arguments as to why. It's very easy to give people the right pronoun.It doesn't really affect you. But also ‘you’ was originally a plural pronoun that we alsouse in the singular.Alie: Oh!Helen: Yeah, and people have adjusted to that because they've had a few hundred years to dealwith it.Alie: What was it before?Helen: Oh, so ‘you’ was the plural form and ‘thou’ was the singular form and the informal form.And you would use ‘you’ to be polite. And then people were so polite ‘you’ just becamethe dominant form.Alie: Really?Helen: Yeah.Alie: I didn't know that.Helen: And people can handle that. So, ‘they’… I mean, it's not such a leap. People use ‘they’ asa kind of general pronoun anyway. Like when they're not sure who they're referring to.So if I said, "Oh, I'm going to stay with my cousin." You might say, "Oh, where do ‘they’live?" without it being a political thing. But as soon as you introduce the politics to it,for some people, their fuse is lit. 15Alie: I wonder if part of it, it's just a resentment that a newer, maybe, generation gets abenefit of something that we didn't, you know?Helen: Yes.Alie: I think about what my life would have been like if I weren't gendered so much. And Iwonder if anyone just is pissed that they're like, "You get that?! I didn't get that!"Helen: Right! Yes, I definitely think there's some part of that.Alie: Which is the worst reason to withhold something from someone. The absolute worst,most petty, bitchy...Helen: Yeah. I'm very interested in how language is used to manipulate. And in positive andnegative ways, it can be used for that a lot. I was reading this ‘80s classic-of-businessschools kind of manual, which is about the language of persuasion. And it was talkingabout just how it's much easier to double down on something that seems like a baddecision than to admit that it was bad and do something different.Alie: Oh my god.Helen: You start seeing that and just all sorts of things.Alie: That was in an instructional book???Helen: Yeah.Alie: Oh, that's horrifying. That explains a lot of our politics now.Helen: Really does, doesn't it? You start seeing it everywhere.Alie: I keep wanting to do an episode just called, “Apologies” with someone...Helen: [cracks up laughing]Alie: ... who is a good mediator who can just explain the best way to apologize.Helen: That can just be a whole mini-series in itself. There’s so much to apologize for.Alie: Can we do some Patreon questions?Helen: Oh yeah!Alie: Okay. This is rapid fire. It's lightning round. We'll get to as many as we can.Helen: Great. Hee hee! 16Aside: So, before listener questions from Patreon, there may be some info on itemsand services that I use and like and who support the show. Also each week a portion ofthe proceeds from ads goes to a charity of the ologist’s choosing. And this week Helenchose POPStheClub.com. Their mission is to transform the lives of teens who have lovedones in prison or in jail. POPS stands for ‘Pain of the Prison System.’ And they establishthese high school clubs for these kids to gather, they can be empowered throughcreative expression, writing, poetry, emotional support. They also publish a book full ofthe students' creative work, writing, and poetry. So, it's POPStheClub.com is who Helenpicked.Okay, Patreon questions.Alie: I'm going to go in order received. So, I didn't categorize these.Helen: It's very fair.Alie: It's very fair. Adrienne Van Halem asks: What's the origin of the phrase ‘red herring’?Helen: Oh crap. I did know this from Answer Me This, but I can't remember. [laughs] Sorry.Alie: Okay. I’ll put it in an aside.Aside: Okay, looked this up and supposedly it’s from smoked herrings turning redwhen they're cured and fugitives leaving trails of them to fool and confuse bloodhounds.So, a red herring is like a gross trail of fish that a dog thinks is you. This episode startedoff so horny. I don’t know what happened. [toilet flushing]Alie: Christina Shuy says: Do you have a favorite word and history of? Other than mediocre?Helen: Yeah, mediocre was good.Alie: Any seconds?Helen: Just trying to think, I mean, there are lots, but now my mind's gone blank. Never heardof a word history before. No, I mean, this never happens when you get like a directquestion, like, what's my favorite film? I've never seen a film.Alie: [laughs] Ever! What is one?!What was the last word that you learned? Do you remember?Helen: Oh, there are words that I have to look up every time. Like lacuna. I just cannotremember what lacuna means.Alie: It's a great, great word. You know how I learned that word? Did you ever see EternalSunshine?Helen: I did. And that was how I learned of the word but I still haven't...17Alie: The best!Aside: A lacuna, are you ready for this? Is a bookbinding term meaning a chunk ofthe glued pages have detached from the spine and are missing. And in Eternal Sunshineof the Spotless Mind, which was written by the genius Charlie Kaufman, the companythat can wipe away specific memories is called Lacuna Incorporated. [clip from EternalSunshine of the Spotless Mind, 2004: “But why remember a destructive love affair? Here atLacuna, we have perfected a safe, effective technique for the focused erasure of troublingmemories.”]Helen: Just can’t… It just won't fix in my mind.Alie: Well, there's a blank spot where lacuna should be.Helen: Yeah.Alie: There's a lacuna...Helen: AHHHHHH!!!!!!Alie: ... where there's a lacuna!Helen: That's how I'm to remember it! Thank you!Alie: Boom!Helen: You really guided me through that.Alie: Erica Smith asked: Do you have a favorite website to research the etymology of wordsor phrases?Helen: EtymOnline. Strongly recommend.Alie: Awesome. Bob White [“Hi Bob!”] just says... This is an imperative, not even aninquisitive: Explain queue. Q. U. E. U. E.Helen: [laughs] Well, it's a way you stand in line with people. We got the word from French. InFrench ‘queue’ is pronounced queue [ph. kuh] and means tail. So that's very cute, isn'tit? Like a dog’s little queue [ph. kuh].Alie: Oh, that's adorable! I do love that, having context for all these words, it's like seeingsomeone's face and being like, okay. And then getting to know them as a person. Youknow?Helen: Yeah.Alie: Awww, I love it. Katie Cobb: Why is ‘the eff word’ so versatile?18Helen: It's a great word, isn't it? A lot of the swears are very flexible, but particularly that one‘cause it can be noun, verb, affectionate, sexual, insult. Yeah, it's very handy.Alie: Yeah, what is the fucking etymology of that word?Helen: Oh, that is a hard one to know because, it's old but it's also ‘cause it's kind of slangy. Sowhen people make up an acronym for it, it's definitely not an acronym. It's hundreds ofyears older than that. But a lot of the etymologies of swears are just a bit unsatisfactorybecause they don't really know. But, it wasn't such a rude word as it is now. Like the Cbomb wasn't such a rude word as it is now. Like, religious swears were more rude inthe 14th century when these swears were around; body parts, and sexual ones, not somuch as the religious ones. But yeah, I think when people are down on swearing, youjust think, well, what word can you use in as many varied ways as the F bomb?Alie: It is the Swiss Army Knife of cussing.Helen: [cracks up laughing]Alie: There's nothing it can't do.Helen: That is a wonderful way to describe it.Alie: I still can't say the C word. That’s not a word that… I think that's more of a British word.Helen: Yeah. I didn't realize… that's been very educational to me making this show aboutlanguage. I knew that there were differences in American vocabularies versus English,but I was less aware of the nuances of usage, because I hadn't spent as much time in theStates. There are certain things you don't realize it until they’re pointed out. So, I thinkthe fourth episode of The Allusionist was about the C bomb. In Britain, it is a strongswear. It's one of the strongest, but you still get people who are kind of... it can be anaffectionate one. "Ah, you old C bomb!" You know, in context. You wouldn't say that tosomeone you weren't very confident would understand the intent.Alie: Of course. This almost dovetails but Danielle Rivera asks: What is your biggestword-related pet peeve?Helen: Oh, I have a lot, but I'm always trying to confront my prejudices, and some of them Ithink will never leave, but I can just not give them more room. Others have reallydissipated over the years. But at the moment I am really keeping an eye on the word“community.” I think that people using it should think, "Is there another word I canuse?" Because I think it's being used thoughtlessly, and so when people say ‘the blackcommunity’ or ‘the gay community,’ that sounds like it's 40 people that meet in a villagehall and they all have the same viewpoint.I can understand why something might be quite specific, you might have the gaycommunity in a particular city, but when you're talking about millions of people, it's toosmall a word for that. And I heard someone say ‘the female community’ and thought, 19"That is half the world. That is not appropriate." So, if you're using community, I thinkthere are different nouns you could use or different ways to reframe the adjective thatyou're using. Like science community, you could say ‘scientists.’ So part of it, to me, isan efficiency thing, but partly also there's a kind of condescension in it sometimes. AndI'm always thinking, “Why is that there? What's it covering over?”Alie: What would be a better word in the context of the black or the gay community? I agreewith you completely.Helen: Yeah. Often, it's ‘people.’Alie: People?Helen: Yeah.Alie: Boom. Done.Helen: Black people. Gay people. But then it's like, what you're trying to say with such a biggeneralization? Should you break that down a bit more?Alie: So, indicative of, perhaps, what you're saying doesn't reflect the thoughts of everyone.Helen: Right. Just be careful of the generalizations. Yeah.Alie: That's a great note. Danielle Rivera also wants to know: How many people assume thatyou study insects or that you have a podcast about bugs?Helen: Quite a lot! And confusingly, right behind your head are some beautiful insects.Aside: I have a big, gross dead bug collection on one wall of my apartment and I’mjust realizing how creepy that must be for visitors. But Helen is very wonderful andshe's compassionate. But yes, etymology and entomology.Helen: But I can understand why people would mix them up because they're not exactly wordsyou need in your everyday vocabulary. I wouldn't necessarily remember if I didn'tparticularly care about either.Alie: Oh, sure. Yeah, they don't roll off the tongue often.Helen: So when people get it wrong, I think, “at least they tried.”Alie: They're so close.Helen: They busted out a tricky word.Alie: So, so close. That'd be like if someone bought you a shoe and it was a 7.5 and not an 8.You'd be like, pfffflookathowcloseitis! Ivey Crutchfield wants to know: Can you ask herthe origin of coccyx?20Helen: Wow. That's a really interesting one. I could look it up. I don't keep all the words in mybrain.Aside: A coccyx, sidenote, is a tailbone. So, technically, there were two presentwhile recording this. Also present, next to us on the coffee table, is a hulking 5-poundDictionary of Etymology that I’ve had for 20 years. It's one of the first things I'd rescueshould all of my belongings become threatened by fire. That’s not true. I’d probably runout of the house without pants and then just order a new book online with the insurancemoney. But anyway, we looked it up for you, Ivey.Helen: Oh, this is good, actually. It's from the Greek word ‘kokkux,’ [ph. kuk-koo] [cuckoo clockcuckoos] supposedly called by the ancient Greek physician Galen - who was veryinfluential in the history of medicine - because the bone in humans supposedlyresembles or Cuckoo's beak. Wow!Alie: Your butt bone is a bird beak!Helen: [laughs] Isn't that nice and alliterative!Alie: Boom!Helen: There you go.Alie: I'm so glad they asked! Thanks, Ivey!Helen: Lovely question.Alie: Mads Clement wants to know: What's the best way to take down linguisticprescriptivists? Every time someone's like, [mocking] "That's a made up word," I wantto do murder.Helen: Yeah. Well, all the words are made up, ultimately.Alie: There you go.Helen: Yeah. Language evolves and you can't stop it. But you can be swept away by the tide ifyou just stand there not moving.Alie: I like that idea.Aside: Once again, “Language evolves and you can't stop it, but you can be sweptaway by the tide if you just stand there not moving.”Alie: Kadie Spino wants to know: Can you do the thing that the dad and My Big Fat GreekWedding did and trace any word back to Greece? [clip from My Big Fat Greek Wedding,2002: "Gimme a word. Any word! And I show you how the root of that word is Greek.Okay?"]21Helen: No.Alie: No. [whispering] Can't happen.[clip from My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Girl: “Okay Mister Portacollis, how about the wordkimono?” Dad: “Ah ha! Kimono. Kimono, kimono, kimono...”]Alie: Em Meurer wants to know: What is your opinion on starting essays with, "Webster'sDictionary defines X as...”?Helen: HA! That is desperate! Yeah. Don't do it. And also don't start anything with, "It is atruth universally acknowledged..." in a Pride and Prejudice rift because I see a lot ofjournalists starting articles with that and I'm like, "You're out of ideas." What happensin the next paragraph, if you're trying to do that beginning? What happens next? Andthen you could work back to opening with something more relevant.Alie: So that's tired, played out, done.Helen: It's rather tired and played out. But also, what is it you're trying to say by citing that? Itfeels like… that's your training wheels and you're not ready to take them off your bike.Alie: [giggles] Anna Thompson mentioned the unnecessary U’s and someone else answeredthat about back in the day when you took out an ad in a paper and they charged by theletter...Helen: Oh, unfortunately that is made up, but it's a really wonderful story that I appreciate. It isjust that American English is somewhat more streamlined than British English, which Iappreciate. So, British English might have the U's cause it's like, oh a lot of those wordscame from French. And in American English, you're like, "Why do we need it?" ‘Causeyou can't hear it. It doesn't add anything. Get rid of it. Or like theater. You know, ‘er’rather than we have, it's still ‘re’. And it doesn't make sense that we still have that, but Ithink we're, in England, still attached to the past and have resisted attempts to make thelanguage more logical. Whereas in the States you have less fettered by that history.Alie: Oh! I didn't know that. I totally bought the thing that it was...Helen: It's a great story. A lot of the really attractive stories, unfortunately, are false ‘cause it'seasier to make up a great story than to actually have one in life.Alie: Well then, you've just debunked some flimflam.Helen: Oh, shit. Puncturing dreams. That's me.Alie: No, I loved it. Rae Casha wants to know: Did all language evolve from an originlanguage? 22Helen: There's like three origin languages. But then, I think it's not even that straight forwardbecause there are some where they don't really act like any other languages. LikeBasque in northern Spain is not like Spanish, but it's also not really like anything. It'sexciting. Finnish, that's very unusual.Alie: Oh, I’ve heard about that. [clip from YouTube Wikitongues Channel, woman speakingFinnish: “Muualla Suomalaiset on aika hiljaisia ihmisiä, me ei tykätä puhua hirveesti smalltalk"]Alie: So they think three origin languages, perhaps.Helen: Yeah.Alie: Okay. I was surprised by what a Romance language is. I thought I knew them. IsEnglish not a Romance language?Helen: It sort of is. Romance languages are, broadly, languages that were heavily influenced byLatin. So like Spanish, Italian, French, English 60-80%.Alie: Yeah. I didn't know that. I thought it totally that it was. Carrie Stuard wants to know:Are there any synonyms for the most hated word, moist? [splat!]Helen: Moist. Do you hate the word moist?Alie: At this point, it's an underdog. You know what I mean? Like, can moist live? Can it justdo its business? I don't hate it.Helen: It's fine.Alie: I don't hate it. I tend to think of dew or grass more than I think of...Helen: Well, that's a lovely form of moisture. I suppose the people who hate it are maybethinking of bodily crevices.Alie: I think... [laughs]Helen: And that's their prejudice showing.Alie: Yes, it is.Helen: Yeah. Because other words like damp… I mean, if you're moist from the rain, like araincoat. Damp. Is that better? Is that worse? A bodily crevice could also be damp.Alie: Sure. I feel like moist has a certain heat to it that damp lacks.Helen: A steaminess rather than chilliness. It's good that we're figuring these things out.Alie: Anyone who hates that word, hopefully you hate it more now. 23Chris Brewer wants to know: How do you feel about people using emojis instead ofwords? [clip from YouTube user AkA: “Which emoji are you?”]Helen: Well, grandma here knows that she's outmoded and I don't speak Emoji. I don't usethem. My mum send me one the other day and that was a shock. So, she's on board.Alie: People don't even send them to you?Helen: They do, but I don't necessarily interpret them in the way they're supposed to beinterrupted because I don't understand how you're supposed to use them and how theyaffect what has been said. Because my assumption, years ago, was they're justreiterating what's in the words. But I don't think that is the case. They are influencinghow the words are supposed to be interpreted. But that is the part that I don't know. Soit's a bit of a problem, I think, that I don't speak emoji.But what I don't like is that the visuals are controlled by someone else. So if you werehandwriting you probably wouldn't do your own emoji. There's, like, hundreds of themand it would take a long time. So, I find that a bit prescriptive by Unicode, deciding whatcan be expressed. So, we may only have 26 letters in the English language and somepunctuation, but there's a lot of combinations, mathematically.Alie: Do you have any emojis that really irk you?Helen: I think it would be unfair to pick on some when I don't understand, like, what the nailvarnish one means, or the dancing one.Aside: Helen, I got you. So does Emojipedia.com. So, according to them, the nailpolish emoji is often used to display an air of nonchalance or indifference. And, thedancing emoji is used to represent a sense of fun or as a positive affirmation, like saying,"Great!" Also, the study of pictures representing thoughts is called ‘curiology’, and I dohave an emoji expert lined up. Should I do it? Are y’all ‘nail polish’ or ‘dancing’ about it?Alie: In terms of speaking in gifs, too… How do you feel about that?Helen: Again, I don't fully understand, but I do enjoy that more. It seems inventive but I thinkit's also because there you often get a facial expression, a moving facial expression andthat means more to me than a, kind of, cartoon facial expression or someone who'ssticking their tongue out and there's a dollar bill on it, in emoji.Alie: I don't know that one either.Helen: Well, I painted a picture for you. If I put a dollar bill on my tongue, now you'llunderstand what the emoji is doing. [clip: “Dollar dollar bills, y’all.” -Eastbound andDown]Alie: But actually this brings up the point of gif [ph. jiff] versus gif [ph. giff]. 24Helen: Yeah, right. You pronounced it the way that the person who coined it says it should be.Alie: Exactly!Helen: But, I say gif [ph. giff] because then people know what you're talking about.Alie: Well, which is it?Helen: It's a recently made up word. I think that if they wanted it to be pronounced gif [ph. jiff]they probably should have gone with a J instead of a G.Alie: Alright.Helen: I know I'm rebelling against the originator, but I'm on gif [ph. giff] because it's lessequivocal. Can't mix it up with the lemons.Alie: What do you think is going to win out over time?Helen: [chanting] Gif! Gif! Gif! Gif! [ph. giff]Alie: All right. I am shocked that we say different things. I thought it'd be like if someonesays your name is Helene.Helen: Yeah, right.Alie: But then again, if enough people call you Helene, your name is Helene!Helen: Right. Yeah. My mum tweaked the pronunciation of the last name, so…Alie: That's what it is!Helen: Right, that's what it is now. I don't even know what it was two generations ago becauseit's immigrant names. They mutate.Alie: Do you know what it means?Helen: It's, like, salt vendor. Something like that. Probably.Alie: Oh! Well, salt was currency, so...Helen: Yeah, it's useful condiment.Alie: Dollar bill on my tongue emoji....Helen: Daaaaaaa! [laughs]Alie: That's what that means! [laughing] 25Helen: If people started doing that in real life where they acted a lot more like emoji and theycarried the props around with them, then maybe I could get on board.Alie: All you really need to know is that if you get an eggplant text...Helen: Right. It's lascivious, I understand.Alie: Yeah, better be from your husband.Tyler Q says: First off, huge Allusionist fan. Come back to Melbourne. I promise wewon't poison you again.Helen: It's not your fault. It's not your fault I got ill in Australia. It's my fault.Alie: Was it?Helen: It's not their fault. A lot of Australians were self-blaming… It's not their fault. And also,wonderful healthcare that's free for Brits. I appreciate it immensely.Aside: Helen had been working really, really hard. She was exhausted. She hadtonsillitis and she woke up with a swollen neck. She had an infection in her neck. Sheneeded surgery and she was in intensive care on a breathing tube, being monitored tomake sure her blood wasn’t poisoned. Trooper! She podcasted from her hospital bedand she now has an awesome scar and a good story.Helen: I mean, if you have to get stuck anywhere, may I recommend Tasmania? It's reallybeautiful. Food's amazing. The people are very sweet, and there's some magnificentwildlife. Vineyards and cheeses.Alie: Good to know. I'll schedule a surgery.Helen: You don't have to have the surgery. You could just go.Alie: But Tyler Q does apologize.Helen: Thank you, Tyler. It's not your fault.Alie: He does ask: Why are a lot of science-based words like species names said in Latin?Helen: Yeah, that's a really good question. Partly, I think because it's kind of an internationallanguage. So, scientists might not all speak English, or French, or German, or whoeverdiscovered a thing, but they might have all tapped into Latin. I think the other thing isthat Latin still has a lot of status even though the Roman Empire collapsed, what was it,1600ish years ago. So, people associate it with study and intelligence. It waspropagated by religion, by Christianity being performed in Latin, and by kind of highlevel politics, and stuff like that. That has helped propagate Latin for hundreds of yearsafter the Roman Empire fell apart. 26Aside: For more on that, please enjoy the Classical Archaeology episode on AncientRome.Helen: But it still has this reputation of things being classier and more intelligent. And that is areally good con to pull.Alie: [laughs] That's a long con.Helen: It's a long con! And it's still happening! People are still coining new Latin words.There's a radio station in Finland I made an episode about, that has done a newsbroadcast in Latin every week since 1989. Obviously, words like airplane have no Latinequivalent, so they have to make those up, and computer. But I interviewed a guy whocoins words for that and he was someone that's no different really to how computerdidn't exist in English and then it had to be invented when people started havingcomputers or Internet. So actually, it's fine.Aside: Props to Tuomo Pekkanen, a Finnish Latin professor. And for more on thisyou can see The Allusionist episode number 5 titled, Latin Lives!Alie: Okay.Helen: Yeah. Showed me.Alie: I mean, I remember learning Latin, we just learned so many words for kill.Helen: DID YOU??Alie: You could kill by bludgeoning. Yeah, there were so many. But of course...Helen: It was useful.Alie: Yeah, I mean in those times.Helen: Yeah, it's really indicative of what they were interested in.Alie: Yes.Helen: Yeah, we didn't learn anything that interesting. How disappointing.Alie: I just remember being like, "This is quite gory! Another word for kill?” Slightly differentways.Helen: So many inventive ways to destroy a person.Alie: What do you hate the most about your job?Helen: I hate myself, [Alie laughs] and having to spend this amount of time with my talking, andmy thoughts, and how limited I feel in my mental capacity. [laughs] So there's that. Also 27sometimes it's quite lonely because you're on your own a lot, producing stuff. So that,and I hate the technological side, but I have to do it. But I do find it boring and oftenfrustrating. And often it's three in the morning, and I just really need to get an episodeout, and something's going wrong and I don't understand why.Alie: Do you work several weeks ahead? Or are you finishing an episode....Helen: [laughs]Alie: Yeah... I finish an episode an hour before it goes up.Helen: Ohhhh, gosh. Yeah, like, no minutes.Alie: Oh god, that makes me feel so much better.Helen: Oh, I think it's weird when people are way ahead. What if something changes? What ifsomething comes up that you think, “Well, now's the time to do that.”Alie: Right. Okay, that makes me feel so much better. I figured because you are so successfulthat you just have them lined up and they just come right off.Helen: No, I'm just the most tragically disorganized person, and it's got worse as well. Like, Iwas always bad at planning ahead and now… Since I got I'll, actually, last year, I lost a lotof time that I would usually use at least banking some interviews to get ahead on thepodcast. But also, I think what's happening in the back of my mind is, "Well, you couldplan ahead, but you might get stuck in hospital in Tasmania and never go there."Alie: [laughs] So you're using it as an excuse.Helen: I think subconsciously I am.Alie: That's fine.Helen: Yeah. Just to be absolutely terrible at forward planning.Alie: That's great. We all do that.Helen: It's ridiculous. I need to get my shit together.Alie: What is your favorite thing about your job or about word origins?Helen: Ooh. Oh, loads of stuff. Learning is great. That's a real privilege in a job. The peopleI've met through podcasting, that is delightful. And getting to spend time in listener'sbrains. That's amazing.Alie: Yeah. 28Helen: Creepy. I've just made it sound creepy. [mischievous laughs] Goodbye, your internalmonologue. I'm here now.Alie: [cracks up] Do you have a favorite thing about word origins?Helen: Hmmm… Do I? Favorite thing? I like when someone has a rigid idea about how thingsshould be and there's just so many examples in history of why they're not like that.That's useful to me.Alie: Disproving people.Helen: See, if I can just transform society through the medium of light entertainment that'sabout words.Alie: I would say that you already are. And, thank you for doing that.Helen: No, you are so welcome.Alie: Thank you for doing this. Thank you for sharing so many words with me.Helen: It is so nice to be here. Thanks for having me.Alie: Yay etymology!Helen: Yay etymology and entomology.Alie: And entomology, yes. Thanks for not being bugged by it.Helen: Aye!!!!!!Alie: I know you hate puns I’m sorry, it’s the lady sitting in the middle seat, who has to get up to pee, but you’re in the windowseat and you’re so relieved she does, because that means you don’t have to ask the guy in the aisleto get up, Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. Oh, video games! [Mario coin-collectingnoise] Video games, what’s their deal? How do they affect our brains? Have we got an ology for y’all!First, I do have some thanks.Thanks to everyone who’s pledging some of your latte money or tossing me a quarter a week onPatreon for making it possible for me to get my physical butt in the same space as the ologists, or inthis case, pay a recording studio to do our first ever remote interview. Very exciting. Thanks toeveryone sporting Ologies merch out in the wild – that’s at OlogiesMerch.com. T-shirts, hats, pins,all of that. Thank you to everyone who rates, and subscribes, and reviews. You leave such nicenotes! For example, Namon says:I love this podcast so much. I found it when searching for podcasts to sleep! Sadly, I found apodcast to binge and stay up even later. Thank you, Alie Ward, for the podcast that haseverything from biology to beauty. I never did solve my sleeping problem, but I don’t reallymind anymore, so thank you for the podcast.Well, thanks for the review! Try the Fancy Nancy. Just lay in bed, you think of a category, and thenyou think of something that starts with an A, and a B, and a C… If you didn’t listen to the sleepepisode [Somnology] that’s in part two of the sleep episode, and it’s named after my very fancymom, Fancy Nancy, who came up with it.Back to ludology. Who’s excited? I mean, we all are. So, ludology. Let’s get right into it, pals. It’s areal word, it means the study of games, and it comes from the Latin lūdēre, which means ‘to play’.Yay! It was coined sometime around the 1950s. It didn’t mean video games back then because timemachines had not yet been invented. Nowadays, it can encompass gameplay, and sports, and cards,and of course… beep-bop video games.This ologist has been beep-booping in my periphery for years. My sister told me about her TEDTalk, and she was discussing her game SuperBetter, that can help folks who are healing from anillness or going through anxiety or depression. So I’ve been a fan of hers for years, and I reached outto her. I chewed my fingernails waiting for a response… She said she was down to record, but ourschedules just couldn’t get aligned.Finally I took the plunge, she ducked into a recording studio in Berkeley. We taped this remotely,you guys! And it wasn’t awkward. She’s… so good. She has a PhD from the University of California atBerkeley in Performance Studies and she’s designed games since 2003. She taught game design andgame theory at UC Berkeley and the San Francisco Art Institute; she’s been named as one of thetwenty most inspiring women in the world by this lady named Oprah in a magazine called Oprah.She’s a speaker. She’s author of the book: Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and HowThey Can Change the World, and the New York Times bestseller SuperBetter: A RevolutionaryApproach to Getting Stronger, Happier, Braver and More Resilient. She’s the director of gameresearch and development at the Institute for the Future. She’s legit!I was so nervous before taping this because she’s just, high-badass. She couldn’t have been moreaffable and great. We chatted about IRL games, board games, animosity, Fortnite, the line between 2play and addiction, League of Legends, gambling, lottery tickets, off-brand Atari, what Tetris does tothe brain, video games and violence, should kids play games? We talked about aliens, soup, and howgames can change your life for the SuperBetter. So let’s press start on a truly life-changingconversation with Ludologist, Dr. Jane McGonigal.----------Dr. Jane McGonigal: Hi Alie!Alie Ward: Hi, Jane, how are you?Jane: I’m great! I’m so excited to talk to you in person. Let me unzip my jacket so I don’t… It mightmake noise. That’ll be better. All right.Alie: So, hi!. First off, Dr. McGonigal, it’s lovely to talk to you.Jane: You could also call me Professor McGonigal for all the Harry Potter fans out there.Alie: Oh, my god. Does that happen a lot?Jane: Yes. When that character started to exist, it made my life so much more fun. [ProfessorMcGonigal saying: “The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.”]Alie: Do people spell it right now?Jane: Uh, no. Not at all. But they pronounce it correctly, which never happened growing up. So ithas helped a lot.Alie: And I do have questions starting right off. Growing up, you have a twin sister? Did you guysgrow up playing a bunch of board games? How do twin sisters pass the time?Jane: Well… Okay, first of all we should talk about board games, definitely, during this interviewbecause some new research came out showing that normal board games are really bad foryour relationships. They lower your oxytocin levels. So, we do have memories growing up ofplaying board games, but we always fought at the end of them. Do you remember, like, gameslike Sorry! where are you would, you know, mercilessly take out other people’s pieces andmove them to the beginning of the game? [valley girl: “Sorry!”] Monopoly, where one persongets power and then lords it over everybody else for an increasingly unfun hour? Traditionalboard games are poorly designed for social interactions and are terrible for you.So yes, I do have memories growing up playing with them. Unfortunately, my sister neverrecovered from those early experiences and would never play like video games or anythingelse with me after that. Literally just a couple of weeks ago I saw this study showingthat traditional board games lower oxytocin levels; you trust each other less. It makes perfectsense because the games are… As a game designer, I can point out all of the ways that theyare poorly designed to lead to negative social experiences rather than positive ones. The oldschool ones, the new ones are better.Alie: Oh my god, that validates so much because I remember even when you would win atMonopoly, you feel bad because you were hosing everyone in your family. You were like, “I’man asshole. I’m like, such a slum lord right now. What do I do?!”Jane: I think people maybe know this now, but Monopoly was originally designed as a pedagogicaltool to teach people the evils of capitalism, and it was supposed to make you feel bad. You’resupposed to play it and say, “Wow, this is awful, and terrible, and let’s be socialists.” It wasdesigned to make you feel bad. In that extent it works. But playing it for fun: not a good idea.3Aside: Oh my word, I just went down a hole on this one. Quick aside. So, Monopoly wasactually the early 1900s brainchild of an anti-capitalist activist; she was a comedian and awriter, she was a -- gasp! -- unmarried woman, Elizabeth Magie. She made it as a cautionarytale, and in her old-timey words, [in an old record filter voice] “Let the children see clearly thegross injustice of our present land system, and when they grow up, the evil will be remedied.”Such high hopes, Lizzie, but perhaps the irony was too lost on us. And that’s why a land baronwho shits in a golden toilet is presiding over the nation. Anyway, so the game had a very sexyoriginal title. It was called The Landlord’s Game, and Elizabeth Magie worked her ass off on it,and then some jabronie played it at a house party and she was ripped off. She made fivehundred bucks, and he made millions, because capitalism.Alie: So when did you start liking game play? At what point did you start playing video games ordid you start to realize that maybe designing it was something you’d want to do?Jane: You know, I have some really positive early memories of my dad bringing home an Odyssey,which was kind of like the knockoff cheap Atari, because we were, like, a knockoff cheapfamily growing up. It had knockoff Pac-Man called K.C. Munchkin that was a really a badversion. Like, it wasn’t well designed either and it was impossible to win. But yeah, hebrought home these cartridges, and he would play with us, and teach us how to get better.Really positive early memories of spending time with my dad, learning these new games andgetting better. He taught me chess, and our grandfather taught us poker and roulette at a veryearly age. We were like five or six learning how to play poker. So there was a lot of game playin my family.And then we got a Commodore 64, which for computer geeks that was one of the first athome computers. You could learn basic programming. In fifth grade, I started making my owncomputer games. The very first one I ever made was called You Be the Judge. I think it wasinspired by watching a lot of Divorce Court and People’s Court on daytime TV. [clip fromPeople’s Court theme] So, you got to be the judge, and also you were a cat because I had to uselike ASCII art and I couldn’t draw a person that well, so I made you a cat. And you had a littlegavel that was animated and you would hear people’s testimony and decide if they wereguilty or not.Alie: Oh my god. That’s so… I watched so much People’s Court too, I completely remember that.Was it gratifying to you when you started… Even as a kid designing games, was it gratifying tosee something that you had imagined be a reality? What really got you hooked in that?Jane: It was totally the experience of having somebody sit down and play with it. I actually madeboard games also. My sister and I would create life-size board games in our basementbecause we had this weird, like, ‘60s psychedelic tile so we would use each tile as a space andyou would have to, like, go to prom and things like that. And then we would have people comeover and play that or I’d have people playing my computer game, and it was watching howpeople would react and, you know, did they laugh or are they surprised? Did they try reallyhard to figure something out? It was the ability to provoke all of these really positiveemotions and see people try and be challenged. It was really interesting to me.I think through my whole life that has been the single thing that’s most interesting to me isthat the greatest joy you have as a game designer is the first time people start to play with itand you’re like, “Oh my god, I had no idea that’s what people would do. I’ve got to changethese 12 rules, and change this constrain, and refigure what the goal is so that they dosomething different.” Watching people react and how it brings out good things in them, and 4maybe things you don’t want to bring out in them, you can change it. It’s kind of like being achef and changing the ingredients you’re throwing in on the fly.Aside: Just a fistful of delight. Maybe a sprinkle of reflective sadness. I mean, after all, shehad a PhD in performance studies, so the doc knows what’s up.Alie: You also studied performance. So do you feel like there’s something… almost like watchingpeople watch a performance or watching someone watch a play or a movie that you’vedesigned or written?Jane: Yeah, absolutely. In the same way that theater or choreography, you need a performer tomake it real. The script or the choreography as it’s designed, when somebody’s embodies it, itcomes to life. When different people perform a play or perform a dance or a song, they bringsomething different to it and express themselves through it. It’s the same with a game whenyou design a game or code a game, it’s not real until a player comes to it and then they bringsomething different to it. With games you get an even wider range, I think, of interpretationand expressivity. They do very much have that kind of idea in common that people bringthese artworks to life and that they are the essence. It’s actually funny. I was a theater geekalso growing up. So like double geek: theatre geek, game geek.Aside: Jane says that when she was around 11 she saw a one-woman play starring LilyTomlin, called The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe, which was written by LilyTomlin’s now wife, Jane Wagner. In it, one character named Trudy is a homeless woman whoencounters extraterrestrials. She’s trying to teach them what art is, as you would do.Jane: So she’s showing them Andy Warhol paintings of soup cans, and then they hold up soup cansand they’re like, “Is this art?” And she’s like, “No, this is the art. This is a painting.” They hadthis whole thing, and then at the end of the play, they go to the theater with the homeless ladyand they forget to watch the play. They were watching the audience, and all of their reactions,and their laughter, and their goosebumps. And the aliens are like, “The play is soup, but theaudience is art.” [X-Files theme with airhorns] And I’m telling you, I think that’s the mostinfluential thing in my whole life I ever saw or heard because then I became obsessed withhow the people who interact with art, or theater, or games, they’re the art!Aside: So the people are the art! Jane says when she was first starting her PhD work shewas kind of the weirdo because everyone else was studying the games themselves, but shewas studying the players and how the games affected them. But I think it’s good to be theweirdo, because that usually means that you have an impact to make and you’re the firstperson to be doing something. So, if you ever whisper to yourself, “Shit, why am I such aweirdo?” Congratulations! Because you’re probably doing something right.Alie: When did you start designing games as a job? When did it become your career?Jane: It’s such a wacky road. When I was in college, I worked with in New York City Department ofParks and Recreation. I helped run these like really big, large-scale recreation events like anEaster egg hunt, for 35,000 kids in Central Park. I always think of that as some of my earlygame design work because, you know, they are games. They’re not digital, but you come outand play. When I went to grad school, I started my PhD program at Berkeley, I was meant tobe studying scientists, specifically quantum physicists, and how they collaborate and howthey communicate their research with the public. Not at all games. I got a side gig my firstsemester as a PhD student. There was a new game company in San Francisco that, theywanted to essentially play games in reality. 5They were inspired by the Michael Douglas Movie The Game. [clip from The Game: “Consumerrecreation services.” “Call that number.” “Why?” “They make your life… fun”] Which, you know,he can’t tell: is it real, is it the game? It’s a bunch of actors pretending to be real people, andthey give him missions, and his whole life is transformed, and he has these amazingrevelations about the meaning of everything. But also it’s really confusing because the gameis played in reality. So this company was like, “We’re going to do that, but we’re going to benice and it’s going to be fun, and silly, and you’re not going to be confused.”They’re still running all these reality games. You run around the city and do missions, like thepay phone will ring and they’ll give you a code, and then you’ll find a box in a pile of leaves,and the code opens the box, and there’s a raft inside and you have to take the raft out on alake. And then you find the snorkel equipment, you have to find something at the bottom ofthe lake. You get to be really adventurous in reality. Anyway, they hired me and that was thebeginning. That was how I earned my credentials to go to the Game Developers Conference.I'm like, “I’m totally a game developer.”Aside: So working in theater turned to working in live events turned to working in liveevents with mobile phones, and then when did that go digital? What happened? Well, 9/11did. Jane had just moved to San Francisco after living in New York for 6 years.Jane: Something weird that happened while we were processing all of that was that an onlinecommunity of gamers that we’d been a part of earlier that year, playing this online gamecalled The AI Web Game. It was very collaborative. 40,000 people on one team all trying tosolve the same puzzle. I mean, kind of like early Reddit in a way. Everybody trying to solvethe same problem using message boards. That community came back to the message boardeven though the game had ended a couple of months earlier and they were like, “Can we solve9/11?” It wasn’t even called that yet, but, “Can we solve this? Can we figure out whathappened?” When it started to emerge that it was a distributed terrorist network, they werelike, “Great, we’re a distributed network of collective intelligence. We can understand howthey might think or operate. We can figure out what security holes they snuck through.”They started to want to use their game skills to help. That was really interesting to mebecause I was feeling powerless, and everyone around me was feeling just, like, frozen. Andhere’s this online community of people saying, “Wait! We are super collaborative, supercollective intelligence. We saved the world in this game. It would be stupid not to try to usethose skills to help when the world really needs it.” That desire was literally the day I’m like,“I think maybe I should study video games, and gamers, and how they collaborate instead ofhow physicists do.”I wanted to find out, is this delusional? Is this crazy wishful thinking cause we’re all sooverwhelmed? Or are there problems that gamers could solve, and are their questions theycan investigate and ways that they could use their skills in real life? Eventually I starteddesigning digital games just to see if I could be the person to come up with the that bridge.“I’m going to make a game that has real problems in it so that gamers can test out thishypothesis that they have.”Alie: How did they do with their research into 9/11?Jane: You know, it morphed pretty quickly into trying to be of service. So, what wound up actuallypractically happening was getting people out to donate blood and volunteer. It became sort ofmore like community mobilization. But the same group of people then started investigatingthings like government corruption, and cold cases, and they created a kind of spinoff site 6called Collective Detective. They continued to play with this and see what they could do overthe next couple of years. When I started designing games, those are the people who showedup first to play.Aside: So side note, I went to go look up Collective Detective, and the website has no pages.There’s nothing to click. Simply the text, ‘Investigating the mysteries of Austin. Appointmentsby referral only.’ So I’m both spooked and intrigued.Alie: Do you have a favorite game that you have designed?Jane: Oh, of course. When I think the one that’s nearest and dearest to my heart would be TopSecret Dance-Off. Don’t know if you’re familiar with this one.Aside: I have not played Top Secret Dance-Off, as it gained huge popularity almost ten yearsago. But it’s not in the App Store, unlike her other hit game, SuperBetter.Alie: I have SuperBetter, of course.Jane: Yeah, more people played SuperBetter than Top Secret Dance-Off because I actually had toshut it down after about six months because it was taking over the players’ lives and I justcould not handle it. The average time spent in the game was about six hours a day, which wastoo much. The idea behind the game is… let’s say you want to dance but you’re shy. A lot ofmy games are based on my own problems. You really want to dance. Dancing is great for you.It feels good. But you’re super shy. Maybe if you could dance in disguise, then it would bringout the top-secret dancer in you.So the premise of the game was you start the game by creating your avatar, which is not adigital avatar; it’s a disguise that you put on in real life. And you introduce yourself to thecommunity by doing the first dance class, which is to dance without moving your feet. Thisintroduces your avatar, which, people were wearing like masks, and wigs and I mean, justamazing. They invented just the most beautiful characters. Then there’s a series of dancequests that you unlock, like dance upside down and dance on a crosswalk.Then you power up with things like a +1 creativity, and +1 coordination, and +1 courage. Thepoints were given to you by other players. This was 2009. People became essentially liketoday’s Instagram stars, but for being characters in dance videos. And you didn’t know whothese people were, but I have since had the opportunity to meet many of these people in reallife, and they’re amazing.But it got really popular in weird places. It was super popular in New Zealand for a while. Iwent down there to give a talk, and all the morning shows had me on TV, and there were filmcrews following me around. It was a weirdly popular thing in New Zealand. But what I lovedabout it is, because you got all your points from other players and you could only give peoplepositive feedback, if you gave them a point you had to explain why. So it was just like, youpost a video and then you’d have a hundred comments from people giving you points andthese really amazing strengths and also saying wonderful things about you. I’ve never seen somuch love and people expressing themselves. And eventually I shut the game down becauseit just got out of control and I was self-funding it and it was, you know… I’m not anentrepreneur, so I mean, I probably should have tried to get VC funding or something, but Ijust shut it down instead.Alie: It seems like a lot of your games have really amazing intentions to change the way people liveor think.7Aside: So after designing a bunch of games, including Cruel 2 B Kind, I Love Bees, The LostRing, and of course, Top Secret Dance-Off, Jane was working in her home office and she stoodup quickly. She hit her head on an open cabinet door and suffered a concussion, which musthave hurt like a bitch so bad. Now, recovery was really rocky and she ended up developingher huge game SuperBetter to help others dealing with anxiety and depression andrecuperation. For more on this, you can see her TED talk, which was ranked in the Top 20Most Engaging TED Talks one slot higher than Bill Gates’s TED talk. Just sayin’.Alie: And so, how far into game development did this happen? And can you tell me a little bit aboutSuperBetter and about, kind of, your recovery with that and how it made you look at games?Jane: Yeah, so this happened in the summer of 2009. This was actually after we’d been doing TopSecret Dance-Off for about six months. I was in the middle of writing my first book on games. Isold the book and I had to write it, and I was halfway through it. I was already totallypersuaded that games bring out the best in us and games can change the world. I’d alreadyfinished my PhD. I was well into this and writing the book on it. When I did get thisconcussion, it was supposed to heal in a few days, and then it was supposed to be a fewweeks, and then it was supposed to be a few months and it actually… I mean, it took years tofeel, essentially, 100% again.But during that time, I had to stop writing, which created a lot of anxiety because the bookwas due a few months. I had to stop my other work because I couldn’t think clearly. I had tostop running. I couldn’t exercise at all because I was having so much vertigo and nausea witheven just moving my head. I couldn’t socialize. I’d go out and even just being aroundfluorescent lights would make me feel like I would fall over. I couldn’t do anything. Doctorsare like, “You can’t have caffeine because it’s creating triggering symptoms. You can’t playvideo games. It’s triggering symptoms.”And on top of not being able to literally do anything, I also started to have serious depression,partly from not being able to do anything, partly withdrawing from things like running andwork and the socialization. But also I learned later that one in three people with a concussionexperience serious depression and it seems to be part of the brain’s way of protecting you. It’svery dangerous to get another concussion shortly after a concussion. It’s called second impactsyndrome and you can die. Part of what happens when your brain is trying to heal is itliterally does not want you to crawl out of the cave, or get out of bed. It wants you to protectyourself and just sit, stay put, until it’s safe to go out in the world again. The part of the brainthat anticipates good things happening…By the way, I didn’t know any of this at the time, right? I had to learn this because I’m like,“Why did my brain break? Why do I want to die?” I learned later that the part of the brainthan anticipates good things happening, when it’s sort of fired up, and you’re gettingdopamine hits, and your brain’s saying, “Hey, go out there! Get the thing you want!” It’s agood food that you’re smelling or it’s your partner or your pet and you want a hug or a lickand it gives you energy and focus. That part of the brain says “No, thank you. I don’t want toimagine anything good happening because I want you to stay in bed and let your brain heal.”Aside: How amazing is this? Also, content warning: Jane went through some pretty toughtimes following her concussion and we talk a little about suicidal ideation after brain injury,which was something I knew nothing about because people just don’t talk about it.Jane: And when that part of the brain doesn’t fire, you get really depressed and even suicidalbecause you literally cannot imagine anything good happening. Your brain just says, “Nope, 8I’m not going to let you picture that.” I learned after all of this was happening to me, that’spart of why suicidal ideation is so common in traumatic brain injury because it’s a verynatural response to… It’s a rational response to not believing that anything could ever happenthat would be good, that nothing will ever make you happy. Somehow through all of this, thefact that I did research into how games affect our psychology and our brain gave me like one,kind of, holy grail, a-ha moment. [“Eureka!”] Maybe I can force my brain back into believingthat good things can happen as a result of my own efforts and attention.It took me years of researching after the concussion to put all the pieces together, but it turnsout that that’s the fundamental neuroscience of gaming. Your brain says, “Hey, somethinggood could happen. You could go further in the game, get a higher score, or you could get anadvantage on your opponent if you take an action, if you make a decision.” That part of thebrain that believes that something good could happen, and gives you energy, and focus, andoptimism. It goes nuts when we play games. That’s the signature finding of fMRI research onvideo gaming.Aside: So the premise for the work that Jane did was trying to bring a ‘gameful’ mindset tothings like recovering from traumatic brain injury, or depression, or anxiety. She went on todevelop the Thank You Game for Oprah, and Jane has said that she’s secretly curious abouthow games can develop the seven positive traits that Buddhists believe can help endsuffering. So what are those traits? I had no idea. Mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy,relaxation, concentration, and equanimity. So how do we go from game playing to a morechill, happy brain? And I asked this for the sake of my own brain. Selfishly.Alie: Can you tell me kind of how games changed the way we think or what happens in the brain?What happens with dopamine and serotonin? What’s going on? What’s in that brainy soup?Jane: There’s so much I want people to know about this and there are two big pieces. I want to tellboth of them because not everybody benefits from playing video games. For some people itcan become almost pathological. It takes them out of reality. It takes them out of their socialrelationships and their goals. So I want to preface what I’m going to say by: this doesn’tnaturally happen for all people, the good things. There are ways that, if you don’t have a goodrelationship with gaming, you can change it so that you’re more likely to get the benefits. Ijust want to preface all this by saying it’s not like games are some magic pill that you playthem and good things happen to you. It really depends on how you play and why you playthat good things can happen for a lot of people.Aside: Just allow me to reiterate that disclaimer. [in the famous robotic voice akin to StevenHawking] Games are not a magic pill and not everybody benefits from video games especiallyif you have a pathological relationship to them however they can really help in the followingways:Jane: The signature thing that I would say, as probably the person who has studied… I don’t thinkthere’s ever been a scientific paper written about video games that I’ve not read. Thousandsof them. I am on it. [“We’re all counting on you.”] I would say this sort of signature finding hasto do with self-efficacy. So, self-efficacy is the belief that you have the ability to take actionsthat can help you achieve your goals. So you have skills, you have resources, you havepathways forward, and different people have different kinds of self-efficacy.I might have a lot of self-efficacy as a cook in the kitchen, but maybe not in my fashion sense.Like, what should I wear today? I’m just not feeling like I have a lot of talent in that area.Different people have self-efficacy in different areas, but if you have the experience of gaining 9self-efficacy in new areas, it can develop a kind of mindset that does translate. So, if you areoften doing things that you’re bad at and then stay with it and get better, and suddenly youhave new skills and you acquire new resources, and you have achieved new goals andmilestones, your brain gets better at looking at a difficult skill or task and saying, “Let me tryit, because I have a great and long history of getting better at things that I’m bad at.”And that’s what gaming does for most people. Games are designed to be hard the first timewe play them. They are ridiculously challenging. You think about a game like golf where thegoal is to get a small ball in a small hole and it is such a bad method to achieve that goal, tostand really far away from the hole, and then use a stick. It’s stupid. [Trump saying, “You’vegotta make the game a little bit easier.”] Why would we do that to ourselves? We do it becausewe want that experience of being bad and then getting better and having to use creativity,and use practice, and determination, and learning from others. All games are like that.Whether it’s Candy Crush, or Pokemon Go, whatever it is, you get better over time and themore different games you play, the more your brain gets used to being frustrated, hanging inthere, feeling optimistic in the face of setbacks. And that is the one generalizable positiveimpact of games that we see no matter what kind of game you play; sport, challengingcooperative board game, you’re playing bridge, or playing a video game. If we can help youget comfortable with not being good at something, trying, using your skills and abilities to getbetter at it, and then you do in fact get better, that can translate to the rest of your life.A lot of my work has been helping people to, one, make sure you’re always playing differentgames. The person who always plays Minesweeper or solitaire, been playing it for 30 years…Not having this benefit; you’ve got to try Fortnite or something. You’ve got to exposeyourselves to interfaces you don’t understand and communities that are totally strange toyou so that you’re always learning and improving.Aside: Go tell grams, “Get on a headset, go play Call of Duty!” She’s gonna love it! She’sgonna love it. So some people really benefit. To a point.Jane: When you look at the research literature, the people who really benefit from this experienceare people who feel like games are real in a way. They don’t see them as escapist, they don’tplay games to ignore their problems, or shove down negative feelings, or get away frompeople who are annoying them. Those people tend to not benefit because they see games asseparate from reality, so they don’t bring the same mindset to real life. Those are the type ofplayers who go on to be… you would call it addicted. It’s not quite an addiction, but it’s a kindof compulsive game play where they play more than is good for them. They feel like they justhave to keep playing cause everything else is so terrible.People who can answer the question, “What does it take to be good at this game? What haveyou gotten better at since you started playing this game?” And can talk about it in a way that’sbigger than just the game.Aside: Such as, for example…Jane: “I’m a good communicator, under stress with my teammates,” or, “I’m really good at thinkingof different approaches to a problem. I don’t just try one way. I try lots of ways.” Whatever itis that you think you need to be good at, if you can talk about that you tend to start bringingthose skills to real problems. And so, if you’re a parent, or you’re a partner of a gamer, oryou’re a gamer, just answering those two questions can unlock, essentially, all the good stuffof games in reality, not just while you’re playing.10Aside: So being a good communicator under stress and looking for ways to solve problems!Both skills are aces. It’s weird how if, in a video game, shit starts hitting fans, you can thinklogically, or strategically, and overcome it. But sometimes in life, it’s easy just to feel boggeddown, and you just wanna lie face down on a carpet and be like, “Not today, life. I am defeat.”But you can ask yourself, “Hey, if this were a game, what would I do? First off, let’s comb myavatar’s hair.”Alie: I never thought about applying it that way. That yeah, it starts hard. Gets frustrating. You getbetter at it.Jane: Alie, is there a game that you play?Alie: I grew up with a lot of Atari. Pong, and Combat, like two pixels on a screen was the wholegame. It’s funny cause I feel like I don’t play as many games as my peers, and I think instead Ijust use social media as a game, for that same reward.Jane: That’s terrible! You can't… because it has all the sort-of motivational aspects of games, but it’snot… We gotta get you off social media and onto Tetris99 maybe, if you like old school games.A hundred people play Tetris against each other until there’s only one survivor, which meanseverybody loses so you can just embrace it.Alie: That’s more of what I need. And it’s funny, my boyfriend plays League of Legends, my nephewand my nieces play Minecraft. What I find is that they play with their friends. They play onlineso they hang out that way. I don’t know, is there a difference in games where you’re playingagainst a computer versus you are in a community and your friends are on a headset andyou’re all yelling at each other trying to like, you know, kill the same elf?Aside: Clearly I don’t know what I’m talking about regarding League of Legends, but I justlooked it up. There are elder dragons, rift heralds, marksmen, jungle monsters… I don’t knowif any of those are elves. Anyway.Jane: Huge difference. It’s not that one is better or worse. They’re good for different things. So ifyou’re dealing with anxiety or depression, a single player game is actually really goodbecause you can pull out your phone and play it for a few minutes. One of the benefits ofgames is that it can stop rumination. So if you’re anxious, you’re anxious because you’reimagining things that could go wrong. It requires your brain to be actively focused onvisualizing things that scare you. One of the best treatments for anxiety in the moment is tojust stop the ruminations, to make a conscious decision not to spend time and energy onthese thoughts. A game on your phone; it could be a mini golf game, it could be Candy Crush, itcould be Words with Friends. Anything that you can play by yourself is fine because it stopsthe thought.Same with depression, people with depression ruminate very negative thoughts aboutthemselves or their circumstances. If you can stop that flow of thought, it’s an effectivetreatment. So, single player games are great and they are really helpful for things like anxiety,depression, and pain.But social games are phenomenal for other things; the quality of positive emotions theycreate, the trust that they build. It’s interesting you mentioned League of Legends. There’sbeen great research showing that people who play League of Legends regularly have astronger social support network than just about any other gamer. Meaning there are morepeople in their lives who will be there for them if they need advice, if they need help in reality,like help moving or physical assistance. People who play League of Legends have a verypowerful social support system where the people they play with will actually loan them 11money. There’s something about the pattern of building your heroes together and dependingon each other to show up for your practice or for your matches. It’s really interesting that youmentioned that.The kind of long-term relationships we build online are really powerful. There’s a term ingame research and virtual reality research for one of the things that really heightens this,which is presence. A lot of these games have a really strong presence, which means you feellike you were actually with someone, that you feel like you were in the same physical space.Aside: Which brings us to… let’s talk Fortnite.Jane: Fortnite has a phenomenal presence factor. People who go hang out in Fortnite now – like 200million players out of nowhere; everybody’s playing Fortnite – they feel like they are together.When we physically spend time with other people, it’s a much stronger bonding that happens,because we take cues from body language and facial expression, and the way that avatars arebeing designed you can express yourself through dances and different emotes. Your avatarexpresses emotion just like you do in reality. It allows us to have a kind of bonding that Iwould say previously you would have needed to be in the same room with someone, butwe’re seeing, both in just talking to gamers but also in the research literature, that thesegames that have this very strong presence. It does translate to a real social support system.Aside: So online friends and in-real-life friends: the gap is kind of closing. Both can offersocial support, and often hanging out online strengthens your real-life bonds. And that’s all soprecious, and so wonderful, but! If you’re wondering if there’s a digital tipping point, I askedabout that. What happens if you’re chasing dragons and then you’re… chasing the dragon?Alie: The addictive nature of it, or what’s happening with dopamine and how that works? And arewe getting these, like, little hits kind of like gambling or like other pleasurable things in ourlives? How is that working?Jane: Oh my gosh, Alie, there’s so much to say here! Let me start with the gambling questionbecause if people can understand this, it will alleviate a lot of anxiety around video gamingversus casino gaming. The thing that happens in your brain where you feel like somethinggood could happen as a result of your actions, it is identical in gambling and video gaming.The part of your brain that says, “Try again! Try again! You might win. Go ahead. Go for it,”that keeps you at that slot machine, or you just need to play another hand in gambling or youknow, make another bet, that is identical to what’s happening in video gaming.But! What happens in video gaming is you actually get better at skills, and you acquire moreresources, and you gain more allies who can teach you, and help you, and show you the way.As opposed to luck-based gambling where you’re just pulling the slot lever or scratching off alottery ticket, you can actually get better and improve your chances of winning in videogaming. So it is a completely different psychological experience, a different neurologicalexperience, because it is not delusional to stay engaged. That is a big difference betweenvideo gaming and casino gaming is that the games at casinos are designed for you to lose.They want you to fail so they can take your money and it is delusional when your brain says,“Stay engaged, stay engaged.” Bad. That is ill social design and shameful, in my opinion.Aside: PS: stay tuned for an episode on the lottery with... a lottologist. Don’t believe ol’ DadWard? Please see lotterycollectors.com, or you can subscribe to the monthly newsletter, TheLottologist. I’ve got an itch to cover it that can only be scratched by a dirty penny and adream, but that’s a different episode.12Jane: In video gaming, the games are designed for you to win and to get better. The developers areon your side, and they want you to experience success, and they want you to develop realskills and build real relationships that can help you succeed. And that’s the big difference. Soeven though some of the neuroscience is the same, the fact that you actually can improve ingames and experience real meaningful development, and growth, and relationship building,it’s a different application of that kind of neurological experience.As we see games kind of spread into different areas of our lives, I always say, is this a gooduse of game design? Is it manipulating people to do things that maybe aren’t in their bestinterest? Or is this actually a good use of game design? It really depends on, is there anopportunity for them to really improve and experience success in something that’smeaningful to them? Maybe fitness trackers are gamifying the steps you take, and thatactually is good for you, and you can take more steps, and that will have a virtuous feedbackcycle where you feel healthier, and now you’re stepping more, and you’re sharing withfriends and it’s upward spiral.Aside: Take a sip of your beverage, or blink twice, if your brain is like my brain trying toremember where your FitBit is and why you haven’t charged it in months.Jane: That’s really good. If you’re using it just to get people to buy more stuff or click on ads, and…How do you get better at clicking on ads? That is not a good system. It doesn’t lead to realgrowth and real relationship building. So that’s my philosophy on how, even though it’s a lotof the same stuff happening in the brain, it really matters if there’s an opportunity for growthand success.Alie: And that actually brings me… I have a ton of Patreon questions. Can I ask you?Jane: Yeah!Alie: So many questions. This is kind of like a lightning round.Aside: Before the lightning round of questions from folks on Patreon.com/Ologies, I tellyou about a few things I like, but before that, each week a portion of the revenue goes to acharity or a cause that the ologist chooses. And this week Jane picked AbleGamers.org, whichworks to make gaming accessible to all. So in their words:We give people with disabilities custom gaming setups including modified controllersand special assistive technology, like devices that let you play with your eyes, so theycan have fun with their friends and family. We’re using the power of video games tobring people together, improving quality of life with recreation and rehabilitation.That’s AbleGamers.org doing awesome stuff. Thank you, Jane. A donation was made to them.Now a few words from sponsors who make the podcast possible. They're also all linked inthe show notes.[Ad Break]Okay, back to your Patreon questions, which are good ones!Alie: That dovetails just wonderfully into one Patreon question – I got a ton – from Mark Williams,David Boffa, and from Sasha KD, they all asked about gamification. And I know that… I don’tthink that you love the word, but is the gamification of behavior or useful technique? Sasha Kwants to know: How do you feel about gamification of everything?Jane: Yeah. You are awesome, Alie, for knowing that I do not use the word gamification to describemy own work because, historically, it’s been used not in ways that authentically empower or 13bring the best out of the people who are being gamified. My philosophy is, if you areconnecting with somebody’s deeply held values, what do they want more of in their life? Theywant to be a better parent. They want to learn something new every day. They want to bebraver and get out in the world more, be more physically active. Whatever it is that theyauthentically want to do that they choose for themselves, if you can put a quest system, or aleveling up system, or a kind of cooperation opportunity where there are multipliers, if youand your friends are doing it together, you can add some game design elements that helppeople do more of what they want. And if they do it, they’re going to experience an upwardspiral of skill and ability so they can maintain it outside of the game. That’s an ideal situationfor gamification.You know, I always say with my own game SuperBetter, that’s not a game I want you to playyour whole life. I want you to play it for a few weeks, and then get that upward lift, and kindof go back to reality, and maybe come back next year if you need another upward lift. Weshouldn’t be gamifying our whole lives in perpetuity. We should use it as a way to give us thatauthentic experience of getting better at something that matters to us. And then once we’rebetter and we’re doing it, that authentic value and reward system will replace the need for amore artificial game one.Aside: So if your aunt or coworker announces every time they hit their water goal for theday, don’t hate the player. Hate the gamification.Alie: And then a bunch of people, Colin Matthew, Carla Kennedy, Helen, and Amy Goldfine all askedabout dreams: Why do I dream of Tetris after playing Tetris for a long time? Two people inparticular, Colin and Amy both said: I love Tetris, but if I play it too long I started thinkingabout it all the time and when I close my eyes, I literally see little tetrominoes falling. Whydoes this happen? Is it a Soviet mind control conspiracy? (Just kidding.)Jane: It is not. First of all, I can say, having hung out with the original designer of Tetris, I will tellyou he’s super nice and cuddly and it’s not a secret Soviet mind control mission.Aside: Quick aside. The creator of Tetris was inspired by the math game, Pentominoes,which looks just like analog Tetris. Also, he is not an agent of Soviet mind control. His name isjust Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov… And he’s from Moscow.Jane: But this is the greatest question because the other public service announcement I always liketo do about video games actually has to do with Tetris and how it takes over your mind. Therehave been three randomized control studies and clinical trials now, including one in the fieldwith people who experienced traumatic events, that show that the way that Tetris takes overyour brain, so that you are flashing back to it; it can prevent flashbacks associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. There’s actually an increasing usage of Tetris within 24 hours of atraumatic event. If you were in a car accident, maybe you witnessed a violent activity, or youwere a victim of violent activity, that if you play Tetris within 24 hours, before you go to sleep,that your brain is more likely to flash back on Tetris than the event which reduces the rate oftraumatic flashbacks in the future.Aside: [in a drawn out, low-pitch] Whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut?Jane: It happens because Tetris is so visually compelling and requires so much visual attention thatyour brain essentially diverts resources from everything else. It works so hard on thisproblem that when you walk away from it, your brain is continuing to work on it. When yougive so much attention to a problem, your brain thinks it’s a priority, essentially. Because 14Tetris is so visually challenging, your brain essentially thinks, “Oh, that’s a priority. I’m goingto keep thinking about it when I walk away, when I go to sleep.So in a way, Tetris is kind of like this miracle. Even if you’re not traumatized, if you had areally bad day and you don’t want to sit there thinking about it or stay up all night thinkingabout it, you can use Tetris to block your brain from flashing back on an experience that youdon’t want to remember. Use the power of Tetris to flashback on Tetris. I can’t tell you, since Istarted sharing this research, I’ve heard from people who’ve been through really horrible,terrifying things, who were able to get the game on their phone and play it and felt like theybenefited and had fewer nightmares and flashbacks than they thought. To your patrons whohave observed this, they are correct and it can be used in really powerful ways.Alie: Oh, that’s so amazing. Just, like, “BRB! Downloading Tetris.”Aside: I downloaded Tetris immediately after this interview. Also, this was gonna be awhole aside about video game music, and its origins, and history, and composition, but inresearching it, I found out that the study of video game music is known as ludomusicology.For real! For real. There are experts all over the world who do this, so yes, you best believethis is on the list. All in favor say ‘be-bop badoop boop boop!’ Okay, good.Alie: I got a ton of questions also about… wait, hold on. I have so many different pages of questions.It’s crazy. Okay. I got a ton of questions about VR. Like Justin So, Dionne Dabelow, KiranaBergstrom, and Janelle York [phonetic] all wanted to know: What video game advancesshould we look forward to? How do you see the industry developing and how does VR and ARchange game design, virtual reality and augmented?Jane: Ah, so many things. Okay, I’m going to focus on a few things. One advance that we’re going tosee in gaming in general, as a result of virtual reality, I believe, is that gaming will become asocially safer and more pleasant space for people who have historically experienced moreharassment. For women, people who are identified as queer, there can be a lot of harassmentin social gaming. That’s just the fact. I spend a lot of time talking to VR developers and I knowthat all of the major VR developers are very much focused on not repeating the mistakes ofthe past of both social media and video gaming. They do not want VR to be a space whereanybody can come up to you and tell you what they think; anybody can come up to you andhave an interaction with you. [clip from Back to the Future, Biff: “Well what are you lookin’ at,butthead?”]They want to invent new kinds of technologies for consent, for who can see you, who cantouch you, who can talk to you. I’m very optimistic that VR is going to thoughtfully notreplicate the kind of toxic environments that we’ve seen in social media and video gaming inthe past. That’s one thing. Yay. [chorus of children cheering ‘yaaaay!’] Another thing that I’mexcited about in VR is VR e-sports. E-sports is obviously becoming really popular andaccepted. I mean, there are college scholarships, there’s college leagues, there’s more peoplewatching online world championships for the biggest League of Legends finals than watchedMajor League Baseball World Series and watched NHL championships.Aside: Quick aside, just to fact-check this. Let’s look at the most-watched world series inrecent years. 2016, Chicago Cubs are in the World Series for the first time since 1907. This isa big deal. Game seven. Who’s gonna win? The viewership is about triple what it usually is fora World Series. With 40 million people watching, the Chicago Cubs take the victory! Fortymillion. Oh, but last year, the number of people watching the League of Legends finals was 100million. Well, that’s an exaggeration. It was 99.6 million. So, yeah. That’s a lot. Sorry, Cubs.15Jane: So, it’s very popular, but I’m interested in e-sports in VR because the e-sports in VR are oftenvery physical. If you look at images or videos of them online, you see people leaping andcrawling, and there’s a real blend of physical sport. But also all of the things that require youto be good in video games and e-sports, the kind of fast reflexes, and visual attention, andresource management that are the kind of strategic decision making that we see in traditionalvideo games and esports. So I’m excited for VR e-sports also as a way to have both realphysical and beautiful gameplay alongside traditional e-sports skills.Aside: Someone develop VR Frogger. But make it like Mission Impossible, but usheringtoads across freeways. C’mon. Do it for the toads!Alie: A bunch of people also had questions about parenting and I know that you have twin fouryear-olds, so I’m sure this is going to be a thing for you. Let’s see, Matt Salgado, CarlaHickenlooper, Radha Vakharia, Carla Kennedy and a few other people asked about addictionto… When should kids start playing video games and how much is too much?Jane: You cannot go wrong if you are playing the game with them. That’s the first and mostimportant rule. There’s no ‘too soon’ if you are playing with them and talking to them aboutit, and for as long as you can continue this, the better. So even if it’s a single player game, likethey’re building something in Minecraft, you are sitting right there. You’re like, “What are youdoing? How did you know to do that? How did you figure that out? Oh, it looks really hard.What’s going on?” Talk to your kids. Let them express their problem-solving process. What’smotivating them about the game? Why is this fun?You want to just draw out as much as you can because it allows kids to really reflect on howthey learn, what they’re getting better at, how they are capable of solving difficult problemsand staying engage with hard challenges. Games are just the most incredible environment foryou to validate your kid’s skills and abilities as a learner, as a creative person, as a problemsolver. So, it’s never too early if you’re playing with them. At whatever age they are, the morethat you can reflect back to them.Aside: [in a hushed whisper] What if they get annoyed with you?Jane: If they get annoyed with you… I mean, you know, if they’re playing Fortnite they don’t wantyou asking them necessarily while they’re trying to frantically build an escape route. Butafterwards talk to them, talk to them about at dinner. That’s the first and most importantthing. Some parents tell me “Oh, games seem antisocial.” Well, they’re probably talking totheir friends on a headset, or if you think it’s antisocial, just sit and play with them and you’vesuccessfully solved that problem.The other thing in terms of timing, I did help do a meta-analysis of all the studies that havelooked at kids and adults, how much is too much. I will say that there have never been studiesshowing ill effects when people are playing less than 20 hours a week. You do see impacts onschool performance, on social relationships with people who don’t play games, on physicalhealth and well-being over 20 hours per week. So that’s just another, kind of, safe zone. Youcan say, “In our family, we don’t play more than 20 hours a week. We just don’t do thatbecause, that’s when all the research says it starts to kind of interfere with other goals thatyou have or your physical well-being. So, we just don’t do it.”And in cases of serious pathological gameplay where people are staying up all night, they’renot doing the schoolwork and not looking for a job, I always say, get it to 20 hours or less. Donot take the game away, because if you understand the powerful effects of games on things 16like anxiety and depression and social support, taking games entirely away from someone, it’slike pulling them off an antidepressant or an anti-anxiety drug without tapering.Aside: I looked up quitting gaming cold turkey, and I did find a site calledGameQuitters.com, which suggested taking a 90-day detox to re-evaluate the role of gamingin your life. It also suggests that during that time: choose new activities, schedule out yourday, and stay out of the house as much as possible. So maybe it’s a good idea to just recordhow much time you’re spending on gaming if it’s a problem, and then as Jane says, you canjust taper off from there.Jane: There’s really no need to take it away entirely. It’s about getting it to a safe number of hours.So as an intervention, if you need to intervene, get it down to 20 hours a week, and that is amuch more effective strategy than trying to get somebody to stop playing.Alie: Oh, that’s so interesting. I love that you’ve read every paper ever. A bunch of people askedabout violence in video games, Emily Braibish, Anna Elizabeth, Janelle York, Lauren Murray,McKy, Sarah-Jane James, Amber Cooper. They all kind of asked: Do violent video games causemore violence? Is there any link between these ultra-realistic feeling games? And then DawnDoherty-Affleck said: My husband is a lawyer, so my question is, why does coming home fromwork and killing things in games like Dark Souls help him relax after a stressful day?Jane: Oh, that’s funny. Dark Souls is a very specific example. That’s almost a masochistic game. It’svery, very hard.Aside: PS, I looked into this Japanese game of fortresses, and knights, and dragons, andbonfires, and moodily lit castle interiors to find a few things. One, you can play as a personwho has no skin, which essentially looks like a human made out of salami, killing things witha sword. Also, it’s widely considered one of the best and most difficult video games evermade. There’s not even a pause button. There’s no pause button! They’re like, “Are you in this,or are you IN this??”Jane: So it’s funny, that there’s some high-powered lawyer who works really hard and then comeshome and plays literally the hardest game, it’s definitely revealed something about thatperson’s personality. They really do like a challenge. So, violence. Look, statistically we knowthat 96% of men under 21 play violent video games. I prefer to use the term games withviolent content because, obviously, the most violent game is football, real football, where youare hitting people and causing brain injuries. That is an actually violent game. Video gamesare not actually violence. So let’s say games with violent content or aggressive themes.Everybody plays them. And if you look at the data, violent crime has gone down and downand down, exactly as engagement with violent-themed games has gone up and up. I mean, it’sridiculous. If there were any, ANY, correlation, let alone causation, you would not see thistrend. Anybody who studies this, that’s the first thing they will say is: over the past 30 years,violence, crime goes down, particularly in this demographic, this male demographic. Itprobably has to do with getting lead out of our paint. You should do a good aside on that.Aside: Okay, first off, the fact that Jane listens to Ologies and knows I do asides warms myheart to the point of bursting. And also, YES, lead paint. According to an article on MotherJones that delves in to the lead-violence hypothesis, they say, “Lead poisoning degrades thedevelopment of childhood brains in ways that increase aggression, reduce impulse control,and impair the executive functions that allow people to understand the consequences of theiractions. Because of this, infants who are exposed to high levels of lead are more likely tocommit violent crimes later in life.”17So why is this? Brain scientists have done scans and found that because lead is reallychemically similar to calcium, it displaces the calcium needed for brain development. Lookingat the data is staggering. You can see how the bans of leaded gasoline and lead paint correlateto these huge drops in violent crimes. PS, I have a victimology episode coming up, and, hellyeah we will be talking about that.Jane: Violent crime is going down. Violent-themed gameplay is going up. It’s just not there. There’sno data to suggest that there is any kind of correlation, let alone causation. However, thatsaid, two things. There are certain types of gameplay that can turn you into a jerk. Not aviolent person, but somebody who has less empathy for people they perceive as weaker thanthem and who are, kind of, moodier, and may yell at you or be grumpy to you and you’re justlike, Ugh, why are you so obnoxious and such a jerk?” That kind of game play is when youplay in these very aggressive-themed games against strangers who you don’t know and willnever see in person.We tend to dehumanize those opponents. We don’t know who they are. We’re playinganonymously online. We’re trying to beat them. We build up in our mind that they’re thesehorrible people and we hate them and we feel antagonistic towards them. Those emotionsthat we build up, the frustration, the anger, the hatred, it’s not like you just walk away fromthe game and they evaporate, so they can linger. Some people hypothesize that there’s a kindof testosterone poisoning from this type of gameplay. I mean, poisoning’s a little strong of aword, but testosterone gets jacked up and so, yeah, you’re kind of a jerk.So, you shouldn’t spend all your time trying to beat people you have never met and will nevermeet online. You know, e-sports is different because these are much more collegialenvironments. You can play against the same people again and again and again. You can seethem in person at tournaments. That’s fine.Aside: [using an old-timey filter] And another thought about violence in video games…Jane: I don’t like to play games where I have to kill people. I hate it. When I play Fortnite, I just hideand it’s literally a game of hide and seek for me. I build stuff and… I can get a top five finishwithout killing anyone, and to me, that’s awesome. I don’t like it. I don’t enjoy it. There’s areason why a lot of people don’t enjoy it. A lot of people don’t want to simulate violencebecause we don’t enjoy it. That’s a natural feeling and it’s why a lot of people are turned off byvideo game culture. It’s not abnormal to not enjoy violence. That’s also a normal thing. Ifyou’re turned off by it, that’s okay. And you don’t have to play violent video games or if youplay them, you don’t have to necessarily engage in the violent aspects of them. That is normaland that’s fine, and I personally feel the same way.Alie: This actually goes straight into… Crystal Mendoza wanted to know: What is the deal withFortnite? Why is it so addicting? Is it the killing part, or is it that kind of feeling that you’rehanging out with friends, that social aspect?Jane: Yeah, there’s a lot of things that is kind of special about Fortnite. I mean, one of the things isjust how easy it is to try again. So if you’re in Battle Royale mode -Aside: Battle Royale mode, by the by, is when a bunch of players play against each other.It’s like a birthday party! But you die.Jane: - you play, maybe you’re dead in five minutes. You can just play again, you can drop back in,parachute back down. You don’t have to wait for anybody. This sense of abundantopportunity, and how fast the games are, and how quickly you can try again. It really powersup that part of the brain that thinks that something good might happen. It’s like, “Oh, 18something good didn’t happen. I’m out. But wait! I’m just going to play again! And somethinggood could happen now!” That rapidity, that sort of iterative nature of the game is really,really wonderful.And they’ve done such a good job with the expressivity of the avatars and how playful thedifferent skins are. When you encounter people, and you see what their avatar is dressed as,and you see the emotes that they do when something good happens, you just kind of feel likeyou’re seeing people. It’s really interesting. People feel like there’s an authentic personalitythat they’re able to express or an authentic emotion, and it increases the sense of presenceand increases the sense of social being. The social side of it is really compelling too.And I just think it’s nice to play a game where 99 people are going to lose and only one personwins, it kind of takes the pressure off. [Lady Gaga saying “There can be 100 people in the room,and 99 don’t believe in you…”] I think it’s easier for people to jump in and it’s… you know,when you’re playing chess, one person wins, one person loses. You were the loser. In theBattle Royale, everyone’s a loser! So, it’s a kind of a low-pressure environment where goodthings can happen.Alie: What do you think video games in movies and TV? Is there anything that you’ve watched thatyou love or hate? And Stewart Caswell wanted to know: From a game designer’s point ofview, what are your thoughts on Ready Player One? But yeah, anything in pop culture thatgets it wrong or that you’re excited about?Jane: Oh gosh. Okay. Well, first of all, every Law and Order episode – on every franchise of Law andOrder – and CSI, and Criminal Minds has been terrible; 100% never gets anything right. Let’sacknowledge that. Even though I love them all and I watch SVU every week. But Ready PlayerOne is interesting because I had a strong visceral reaction to the book that I still kind of feel,which is that I just don’t believe it.Aside: Okay, I was maybe the last person on planet Earth to know the plot of Ready PlayerOne. I just looked it up. It takes place in 2025, the world is a desolate hellscape, and then toescape that, everyone just wears VR headsets. But there’s a real-life game that happens; that’sall I’ll say. Also, wouldn’t everyone get a ton of forehead zits from wearing a headset all thetime in the future? Or would it even matter because you just see each other’s avatars?Anyway, is this our future?Jane: I don’t think that VR is going to be the alternative to reality in that kind of really holistic waythat Ready Player One imagines. I think augmented reality is a much more likely future andthat VR will be more often used for, kind of, short-term immersions. I love VR. For example,it’s being used in hospice care for people who still have bucket list items but they’re dying. VRfor kind of reliving past experiences when we get this really immersive 360 footage and youcan kind of immerse yourself in things that you’ve experienced in the past.I just don’t buy the vision of Ready Player One. I just don’t see that that’s what people want.Kind of going back to research, my PhD research methodology was largely ethnography, ofreally trying to understand what drives people, and sit with the communities, and sit withindividuals, and look for patterns that help explain how a society might evolve when you seea lot of the same thing bubbling up as a motivation and desire in different communities. Andso I just don’t buy Ready Player One as a vision.I think it’s going to be augmented. If you look at what happened with Pokemon Go and howthey were able to get almost a billion users in just a few months, no product has ever scaledas quickly, including the wheel; more humans used Pokemon Go faster than anything that’s 19ever been invented. I think that gives us a better glimpse into what the future of gaming willbe like. People like Pokemon Go because you could still see the world, and you could still haveface to face contact with other people, and you could be physically active, which feels good,and get fresh air and all of that. So, that’s my feeling about Ready Player One. I don’t thinkwe’re headed towards that future. I’d love to see like, Ready Player Two should be about theaugmented reality version of that world and it might be a better one.Aside: I asked Jane if she watched Russian Doll on Netflix, in which Natasha Lyonne is agame designer. Jane said she didn’t watch it because it might just feel like work to her andjust stress her out. Not unlike Fortnite, it’s kind of a birthday party, oh wait… [clip fromRussian Doll: “I am not a cock-a-roach”]Alie: Last two questions if we have a second. Is that cool? The thing that you hate the most aboutvideo games or your work? The shittiest thing about what you do, most annoying… can beanything.Jane: Oh, god. The most annoying thing is… I hate the shame around gaming that is perpetuated bythe media and to some extent by anxious parents. It makes me crazy. I think we need to stopshaming people for loving games because we’ve loved games since we were human beings.Some of the oldest artifacts in the world are game boards and game dice, and we need to stopcreating unnecessary shame around this because it hurts people and it affects their self-imagein really damaging long-term ways. That is the most annoying thing about games is theshaming and the media has a big role to play in it and we need to stop it. [clip from 1982,reporter says: “Video games! They seem to have captured America’s imagination… and itspocket change, as well.”]Alie: That’s legit. What is your favorite thing about video games or about what you do?Jane: I mean my favorite thing is… I love discovering a new game with my husband, still. We’vebeen together since 2000, so almost 20 years now. And one of the first things we did togetherwas play an adventure game called Grim Fandango, one player, LucasArts, browser-basedgame, you explore a world together. And we spent a few weeks playing it together and I still…I love when a new game comes out, whether it’s Gone Home game or Fortnite and we can sitand experience it together. We have these memorable moments in our history.When we found Portal, when we found Braid, when we found World of Warcraft. I really lovedeveloping a skill with him together and having that novelty and that exploration andcuriosity. There’s so many positive emotions that we feel when we play and when you canfeel them with someone you love, it’s really powerful. And so I’m always excited when wehave time and opportunity to discover and you game together. [clip of Lana Del Rey singing,“open up a beer, take it over here and play a video game”]Alie: Now I’m going to have to learn League of Legends and download Tetris.Jane: Yes. Good. Victory.Alie: Thank you so much for doing this. I’m so glad I finally got to talk to you. I feel like I’ve justtoed the line of creepy. I’m like, “Hi, it’s me again. Hi Guys. Hi.”Jane: Oh no. And I wish that I had known that you would interview people on a bench at LAX, wecould have done this a long time ago because that that is something that I often find myselfsitting on a bench there. [classic video game theme music fades up as voices fade down]It’s that guy in your video editing class, who chews so much gum you’re actually worriedabout him. Alie Ward back with another episode of Ologies. So this episode, I’m just, I’m going to saythis up top just to get it out of the way, it’s out of this world. Okay? I said it. It’s out of this world.Now, we’re going to start by talking about the passions that lead to a career in extraterrestrial aliensearches, as well as lay down some foundations on missions in our solar system, and then we’ll getto what could live where. But before to we get to alive things on distant space bodies, let’s thanksome earthlings. Thank you to all the people who make the podcast possible onPatreon.com/Ologies, all my buddies there; to all the folks sporting Ologies swag fromOlogiesMerch.com; thank to all the folks who are rating (and making sure you’re subscribed!) andleaving reviews for me to peruse, like a semi-creep, such as for example, one left by AnonymousEpidemiologist this week who said,More years of grad school than I like to admit tends to hamper my ability to talk about myresearch without being boring, condescending, inaccurate, or worse – all three. I love thispodcast because it helps me figure out how to talk about my own work in a way that is truebut (hopefully) relatable.I think a lot of folks listening probably related to that. So Boom! There you go.Okay, astrobiology. Let’s get to it. Once called exobiology, but let’s consult the Greek, shall we? Soastro comes from the word for star and biology has its roots in the verb to live, so what is out there,living on those ding dang stars, what’s on the planets? That’s the big question. Is anything alive outthere, what are the odds, is it big, is it small, is it cooler than us? To get some answers, we’ll consulta professional. Over the course of 11 months and 27 gentle desperate emails from me, this ologistkindly obliged and the resulting interview is… I was literally about to say stellar. I’m not going… Iswear that was an accident.But it was a stellar interview. He’s such a great dude. He has been a researcher at the SETI Institute(Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that was founded by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, he’s aNational Geographic Explorer who has trekked the arctic and down to the depths of the sea (youmay have seen him in James Cameron’s Aliens of the Deep) and is currently the deputy chief scientistfor solar system exploration at NASA'S Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Sidenote:the opinions he expressed herein are his own, and not those of JPL or NASA. When you’re in chargeof looking for space aliens for NASA, you gotta toss out some disclaimers.He stopped by last week after work and we settled in for an evening talk about icy moons, spacedrills, tiiiiiiny extraterrestrials, sci-fi movies, extremophile tardigrades, subsurface oceans,squirrels, ghosts, (Okay, I brought up the ghosts, sorry), various voyages made by NASA spacecraftand essentially what is lurking in the great darkness of the universe. And does it want to kill us? Somake some space in your brain for the brilliant and wonderful astrobiologist, Dr. Kevin Peter Hand.2----------Dr. Kevin Peter Hand: H-A-N-D.Alie Ward: Okay. That's what I thought. But just in case it was “Hond” I neversaid it aloud. I thought I'd ask. Now, you are an astrobiologist?Kevin: Correct.Alie: When you toss that out at parties, do people know what that means?Kevin: No, because I don't toss it out at parties.Alie: Okay. That's one way to avoid that. What exactly does it mean?Kevin: It's a very good question. Many different ways to answer it, but simply put, astrobiologyis the study of the living universe. That's it in a nutshell.Alie: The study of the living universe.Kevin: Correct.Alie: So this is excluding rocks, air...Kevin: Well, keep going and we'll come back to some of that.Alie: Rocks, air, light, uh… cars… minerals?Kevin: So what's important about it being the study of the living universe is that oftentimeswhen people think about astrobiology, they say, you know, okay, this is the search forlife beyond Earth. And that's correct. That's certainly part of astrobiology. But what'salso a very central task for biology is the study of the origin, evolution, and future of lifeon Earth. Where did we come from? Where are we going? How did life originate? Andso, when you think about the living universe, of course right now, all we know of is lifeon Earth, we have yet to find even a little speck of life beyond Earth. But based on whatwe know from life on Earth and based on what we know about the other major sciences,physics, chemistry, geology, we can make the prediction that if the conditions are right,life should potentially arise beyond Earth.Aside: To be an interplanetary alien hunter, it helps to have a background that’s abit interdisciplinary. Kevin, Dr. Hand, got his bachelor’s from Dartmouth in physics, witha minor in astronomy, and studied some psychology in there as well; then went on toget a master’s at Stanford in mechanical engineering with a focus on robots, and hecontinued on at Stanford for a PhD, and his dissertation was titled “On the physics andchemistry of the ice shell and subsurface ocean of Europa.” It used Galileo spacecraftmagnetometer data. More on that later. Now, the abstract for Kevin’s dissertation uses 3the term halophilic organisms, and yes I looked that shit up and halophilic means “I loveme some salt” in science talk. So next time you single-handedly finish off the onion dip ata party, don’t be ashamed. Just say, “I’m a halophile.” Just own it, my salty bitches.Alie: How did you start to get into this field, were you more of an astro nerd, or a biologynerd, or like an alien nerd? What was your history?Kevin: I don't know. I'm a bit of an intellectual platypus in that I studied physics, andastronomy, and psychology in undergrad. Part of the rationale for the psychology was,well let's say we do get a signal from extraterrestrial intelligence; how do we, with ourfive senses, our senses that evolved under the conditions that planet Earth haspresented us with... But from a captivation standpoint, my curiosity and my obsessionwith this question started at a young age and just looking up at the night sky,Alie: Did you see ET, did you see Alien? There's no lack of aliens in pop culture. What's yourflavor? What's your flavor of alien entertainment?Kevin: Well, yeah, that's a broad question. So to your question of ET, as a young child, I grew upin a small town in Vermont and so the night sky captivated my imagination early on. It'shard to grow up under a clear night sky and not wonder what could be out there. So thatcoupled with Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, both the TV series and books, and some great scienceteachers early on. Those were all big influences.[clip from Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, episode 8: “The cosmos is rich beyond measure. The totalnumber of stars in the universe is larger than all the grains of sand on all the beaches onthe planet Earth.”]And then, yeah, ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Not only did I watch ET, but I alsowas ET for Halloween.Alie: Nice! How many years in a row?Kevin: Still going. Yeah. I haven't stopped, Alie, nope.Alie: It’s a tradition.Kevin: As a kid, my mom sewed an ET outfit for me and oh, I just lived in that thing.Alie: Yeah, that's the best. I can just imagine. They're like, “Kevin, it's February.” “Shut upmom!”Kevin: “Not taking it off!”Aside: So when looking for alien life, real quick, let’s get some stats out of the way.The Big Bang happened approximately 13.8 billion years ago (for more on that, see thetwo parter with cosmologist Dr. Katie Mack.) And Earth has been around for 4.5 billionyears and there’s evidence that life began on our planet at least 3.7 billion years ago, 4maybe even over 4 billion years ago. Now, we are one itsy bitsy teeny weeny tiny tinypale blue dot in the cosmos, but we know there are a lot of grains of sand out there. Howmany could have life?This is where you just grab an envelope, and flip it over because it’s time for the DrakeEquation. Frank Drake, he’s a round-faced man of 88 who looks like he could play agrandpa in an oatmeal commercial. He’s one of the founders of SETI, and in their veryfirst meeting in 1961 he busted out the Drake Equation, posing that the number ofcivilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible is based on –ready? A whole bunch of math!Here we go – the rate of star formation, the fraction of those stars that even haveplanets, the number of planets per star in a habitable zone, and then the fraction thatactually do develop life, then the fraction of those planets that have intelligent life orcivilization, the fraction of those civilizations that make technology that cancommunicate their own existence into the universe, times the length of time they’rebeaming their “heeeyyy” into the cosmos.So, this Drake Equation can come up with different outcomes that vary widelydepending on your estimations for those factors but overwhelmingly, at the very most,our chances of being alone are 30%, based on some calculations last summer by someOxford astrobiologists which included someone name Anders Sandburg, not to beconfused with Brooklyn 99’s Andy Samberg. [Andy Samberg sings: “Welcome to the SpaceOlympics, the year 3022…”]Anyway, that back of envelope deduction is called a Fermi problem. This was namedafter the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, who’s known for those equations like ‘Howmany piano tuners are there in Chicago?’ First you gotta figure out how many people arein Chicago, how many people have pianos, how many people need tuners, blah blah blahblah blah. Also, Fermi famously uttered what is now known as Fermi’s Paradox, whendiscussing astrobiology over a summer luncheon in 1950. Discussing the seemingabsence of aliens, he asked, informally, “Where is everybody?” [“Where is everybody?”repeat with echo, then a kind of echoey collage of these bad boys:Star Trek’s Captain KirkBuffy the Vampire Slayer’s momRandall from This isMarge Gunderson from FargoLillian Kaushtupper from The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]Where is everybody, Fermi’s Paradox, has become one of the smartest stupid questionsever asked. Now speaking of those questions, back to Kevin. When Kevin was anundergrad, he interned at the NASA Ames Research Center and he went to see his heroFrank Drake give a talk. I love this story….Kevin: I was obsessed with this stuff since I was a little kid. I got to see Frank Drake give a talkand afterward, with a lot of trepidation I said, “Dr. Drake, um, I just had a little question 5for ya. It's probably crazy, et cetera.” and I said, “Yeah, so if we think about life on Earth,um, what do you think is going to be the next tool-using communicating organism?” Helooked at me, and said, “That's not a crazy question. It's obviously going to be squirrelsand raccoons.” [laughs] MIND BLOWN! And he continued, he explained his rationalewhich is quite sound, which is that those creatures are coexisting with us right now andthey are problem-solving.Alie: Oh my god, this is going to delight my dad who has now constructed four squirrelhouses on his property. It's like I am welcoming the next species.Kevin: 100% and I like Frank's logic and… it's a fond memory that I have of my first interactionwith a living, breathing scientist and, and to some extent having my, crazy obsessionvalidated by his like, “No, great question! Raccoons and squirrels.”Alie: The BEST! Oh my god.Aside: So, ask smart people stupid questions. Because they’re great questions. Alsohide your wallet from raccoons and don’t tell any of your secrets to squirrels. (Dad.)Now, in his work, Kevin has traveled to all sorts of biomes but he says if you have thetravel bug, you don’t have to do astrobiology specifically to have fieldwork adventures:kinda any Earth science will get you out and about and also, there’s a real need for folkswho want to study geobiology, which is the study of microbes that eat rocks. Anyway, heloves to bop around for science.Kevin: I grew up doing a lot of skiing, climbing, mountaineering, various things, and I've got toget out and see planet Earth. Exploring planet Earth is part of what grounds me, centersme, connects me back with the night sky, and helps reignite that curiosity and thatpassion for exploration and discovery. And so I feel very fortunate that I've been able tohave some research programs where I've gone to Antarctica, made dives insubmersibles to some hydrothermal vents in our ocean, gone up to the Arctic andexplored icy environments up there. Yeah. So it's been amazing going to those places.Alie: Now, what is a day in the life of an astrobiologist like? What does your work look like?Kevin: There's many different layers to that. I'm a scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratoryand part of the job of scientists at JPL is not only to do their own research and to publishpapers, publish or perish, et cetera et cetera, write proposals and get in that hamsterwheel of research. But we also are very engaged with the formulation andimplementation of missions; missions to all sorts of different places. Small objects, bigobjects, nearby objects, far away objects. And for me, what that means is a focus onworlds in our solar system that could harbor life.Alie: Ooh [Alie doing her best theremin imitation] Sorry, mouth theremin over here, couldn’thelp it. [actual quiet, low pitched theremin]Kevin: I focus most of my time, both from a research standpoint and a mission standpoint onJupiter's moon Europa. And to a slightly lesser extent, Saturn's moon Enceladus.6Alie: Why are we looking at moons so much rather than the planets?Kevin: This has been one of the big game changers in astrobiology. I think people probablyappreciate that an amazing revolution has happened in our understanding of planetsexisting beyond our own solar system. This goes back to the early 1990s when the firstexoplanets were discovered. Fast forward to today and we've got both ground-basedtelescopic observations and spacecraft observations, Kepler being the most recentexample, that have discovered thousands of exoplanets. So I think people are, for themost part, pretty familiar with the exoplanet revolution in the prospect for potentiallyhabitable worlds.Aside: Okay, in case you’re like, “Remind me what Kepler was all about again?” Thisis a space telescope that NASA launched in 2009 and it flew around to determine thepercentage of Earth-like planets out there. It weighed about 2,300 pounds and I did abunch of comparisons size-wise and it was about as big as a HumVee. It scooted aroundtaking dope-ass photos, observing 530,506 stars. It discovered 2,662 exoplanets, andafter nine years – way beyond its expected lifetime – Kepler ran out of fuel.Last fall, in 2018, it was deactivated with a “Good night” command sent from MissionControl. It’s now just kicking it in space, millions of miles away, orbiting the sun, but itsdata helped astrobiologists conclude that there may be 11 billion Earth-like planetsorbiting sun-like stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Eleven billion planets, in the Milky Waygalaxy, a lot like Earth. Wha?!Also, it was named after Johann Kepler, who in the 1600s was a contemporary of TychoBrahe, the Danish astronomer who not only had a beer guzzling drunk pet moose thatlived in his castle, but also had a metal nose after a sword fighting incident and wholater died after his bladder exploded because he was too polite to go potty at a fancydinner party. For more on that, see the Selenology moon episode. But anyway, Keplerchanged the game in helping discover so many planets that could harbor life.Kevin: The other big game changer in my opinion, has been what I like to call sort of a newGoldilocks.Alie: Ooh. I think I see where this is going.Kevin: In the early days of astronomy and planetary science and astrobiology, back in the 60s,70s and 80s, when planetary scientists, astronomers, and exobiologists thought aboutwhat it takes for a world to be habitable, that framework was largely based on our Earthbiases. Wherever we look and find liquid water on Earth, we generally find life.Therefore, you need liquid water for life. And in order for a planet to harbor liquidwater, you've got to have liquid water on the surface in contact with a nice thickatmosphere.And for a planet to be able to sustain those kinds of conditions, you have to be at just theright distance from your parent star so that you're not too hot or not too cold. If you'retoo close to your parent star like Venus is, then you're too hot, and you probably boiled 7off any ocean that you once had. If you're too far away like Mars, maybe some of thewater froze out, you lost much of your water to space. But if you're at the Earth-Sundistance, then you're in that sort of Goldilocks sweet spot. [male voice with plenty ofvocal fry reads from Goldilocks: “And it was neither too hot nor too cold; it was just right.”]And you can have liquid water on the surface of your planet. And potentially it's off tothe races from a biology standpoint. That Goldilocks scenario has kind of been theparadigm. What we've learned in the past few decades, and this was largely informed bythe Voyager spacecraft, and then the Galileo spacecraft, and then the Cassini spacecraftthat went into the outer solar system…Aside: Let’s do a rapid rundown of these spacecrafts for your next pub triviavictory:Voyager 1 & 2 are a set of twin spacecrafts launched in 1977. They explored all the giantplanets of our outer solar system. We’re talkin’ Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune; 48of their moons; plus a bunch of planetary rings and some magnetic fields. As ofNovember 5th, 2018, both are now exploring interstellar space, between 11 and 13billion miles away. NASA/JPL’s website has a constantly updated ticker of their location,which is kind of like Find My Friends but for 40-year-old very famous and respectedspacecraft.Now, Galileo was launched 1989, it got to Jupiter in 1995, and orbited the Jovian (akaJupiterian) system. It did 11 flybys of Jupiter’s moon Europa during this outer spacestint. It went from 1989 to 2003.Now, Cassini was launched in 1997. This was all about Saturn, and it entered Saturn’sorbit in 2004 and did two flybys of Venus, saw a cool asteroid, checked out Jupiter, andit also deployed a lander on Titan, which is one of Saturn’s moons, in 2005, and then wecrashed and burned it on purpose in September 2017.Okay, so moons. Europa is one of Jupiter’s. Titan is one of Saturn’s. If you already knewthat, awesome. Here’s something you may not know: In Scotland, it is illegal to walk apig on a leash.Kevin: ... is that these moons of the outer solar system are presenting us with a new Goldilocksscenario. It's a Goldilocks scenario where the energy to maintain and sustain liquidwater comes not from the energy of your parent star, but rather from the energy oftides, the tug and pull that these moons experience as they go around their gas giants ortheir ice giants. The Jovian system, the moons of Jupiter, are great example of this. Thereare four large moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Io does not have an ocean. Iodoesn't really have any water. Io orbits Jupiter and Io is tugged to such a great degreethat it is the most volcanically active body in our solar system – more volcanically activethan the earth. There are volcanoes erupting on Io right now.Alie: Oh, that's cool.8Kevin: Yeah. It's just a beautiful, beautiful gem of a world and it really does kind of look like agemstone when you look at these pictures.Alie: My god! It’s a lava party happening so far away.Kevin: It is, break out the popcorn and just watch.Alie: Spring break on Io!Kevin: And so, in this new Goldilocks paradigm, Io is kind of like Venus. It's got too much tidalenergy. It's too close. Venus is too close, too warm. Io has got too much tidal activity.Let's go to the further up, furthest out of the large moons: Callisto. We think it does havean ocean trapped beneath a very thick ice shell. But Callisto has very little tidal energydissipation going on in it. So in that scenario, Callisto is kind of like Mars. It maybedoesn't have quite enough energy to really make it an ocean that we could explore andthink could sustain life today. But in the middle, we've got Europa and Ganymede.Europa in particular we think occupies this new Goldilocks sweet spot where it's gotjust the right amount of tidal energy dissipation so as to sustain a global salty liquidwater ocean that's 100 kilometers or 60 miles in depth.Alie: Oh my god.Kevin: Yeah, that's the right response.Alie: How deep are our oceans?Kevin: It's about ten times as deep as our oceans.Alie: Holy smokes! The octopods they must have.Kevin: So in the Mariana trench we're about seven miles deep, 11 kilometers down. Europa’socean is 10 times as deep.Aside: Our oceans are seven or so miles deep, but where did the water come from?Kevin says there are two sources: Water from the rocks from which Earth itself formedand then there’s what they call water that’s exotic in its delivery, so coming from cometsor asteroids. This is like Postmates but a dirty ball of frozen space ocean. Ding dong! I’llget it!Kevin: Water elsewhere in the solar system was delivered to the earth. And when it comes tofinding water elsewhere, we now know that it exists not just on Earth but also on ourmoon and these various asteroids, comets, the moons of the outer solar system, in thepermafrost of Mars. There's a lot of water out there. I should be clear, when I say water,I'm not differentiating for the most part, I'm referring to water in ice form, right? Whenwe get to Europa and the ocean worlds, there we are talking about water in the liquidphase.9Alie: Slushy sloshy waters, what a lot of scientists call it, just in case you need to use that in ameeting.Aside: So there’s plenty of water on Jupiter’s moon Europa, both in ice and liquidform. And it’s deeeep. Could extraterrestrials be lurking in those deep dark waters?Kevin: Europa’s small, it's about the size of our moon. Europa has about one seventh of theearth's gravity. So when you do the math, the pressure within Europa’s ocean, it'scomparable to the pressure found within the deepest trenches of our ocean. And sowhen we think about, “Well, you know, could life survive within Europa’s ocean?”, wecan actually do the experiment and look at places on planet Earth where the conditionsare comparable and say, “Oh wow, life found a way in that environment that hasparameters similar to Europa’s ocean or Enceladus’s ocean,” and so on and so forth.[clip from Jurassic Park: founder John Hammond, “Life will find a way, as you once soeloquently put it”]And we can make that sort of biological plausibility connection.Aside: Kevin says that they analyze magnetometer data to figure out what’screating the gravity fields on those worlds and with a lot of whiteboard numbercrunching came to the conclusion that Europa is encrusted in ice with liquid, salty waterbelow it. But how thick is that magic shell of ice? Most of his colleagues would say, “Oh,like 20 kilometers thick,” but he’s in the minority and thinks it’s quite a bit thinner,perhaps less than 10 kilometers thick.So when do we get to bore into it like an icy coconut? Well, NASA is planning to launchthe orbiting space probe – that’s called the Europa Clipper – in about 2022, and that’sgonna take a bunch of sassy photos and determine some chemical composition, settingthe stage for a chilly, icy Europa landing by 2030. What do we call this lander? Well,Kevin kicked around the nickname Europa Landing Probe for Surface Astrobiology orELSA.[clip from Frozen: Elsa sings, “The cold never bothered me anyway]How will they bust through this ice? This isn’t a crème brûlée. At JPL they’re prototypingthese robotic arms and drills and saws and sampling systems, and some of the oceanicdiving technology that they’re tinkering with has a win-win bonus: because it’s makingwaves in our own undersea exploration for this little planet we call Earth.Alie: And now, Europa, is that where we're really looking in terms of searching for somethingalive? Is that really where… All eyes are kind of on Europa?Kevin: Well, I love to highlight three prime ocean world candidates – Europa, Enceladus andTitan. Let me talk about Titan briefly first and we can come back to it. Titan is just anamazing world with this atmosphere in liquid methane, ethane, lakes carving out its icy 10surface and there's a liquid water ocean beneath its ice crust. And from the standpointof astrobiology, Titan is my favorite place to go and look for weird life.Aside: [theremin style “Haaaay”]Kevin: And what I mean by weird life is life unlike life as we know it. Life as we know it is basedon liquid water as the solvent, the substance in which the chemical reactions of life takeplace, and those chemical reactions and the building blocks are of course based oncarbon. We are a carbon and water-based life form. On Titan life would potentially alsobe carbon based, but the solvent might be liquid methane and ethane in those lakes thatwe see on Titan.Alie: Oh my god.Kevin: Could the business of life get done? Could life originate? Is there a weird life form thatcould arise in those lakes and seas? I don’t know, but I'd sure love to get there andexplore. And then Titan could of course, within its liquid water ocean beneath its icyshell, harbor water and carbon-based life similar to what we know and love here onEarth.Alie: How flammable is it there? Like if you’re made of methane and ethane...Kevin: Can you start Titan on fire? The short answer is no because, in order to light somethingon fire, what do you need?Alie: Oxygen.Kevin: Yes. And Titan's atmosphere has basically no oxygen. And that actually is one of thelimiting factors for me when I think about the feasibility life on Titan.Aside: Okay so back to general habitability. Kevin says liquid water is one of thekeystones. What else is on our intergalactic shopping list?Kevin: The other keystones for life are that you need the building blocks, the stuff that life ismade of, the bricks and mortar. For us, that's carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, asmattering of some 54 elements from the periodic table. And then the third, kind of,lesser appreciated keystone is: life needs energy. It needs a power source. It needssomething that can sustain the growth, and reproduction, and the maintenance of life.Technically we call that the ‘redox gradients’ that life harnesses. You bring together areductant, a compound that likes to give up electrons, with an oxidant that likes toaccept electrons. And for us, we Homo sapiens, that redox reaction is eat somecarbohydrates, eat some food, and breathe in oxygen. And then we do a slow burn in ourstomachs. We're a glorified campfire, and so we're doing a slow burn with our redoxchemistry, inside our bodies.Aside: So next time you’re eating fistfuls of cookie dough, just holler, “I’mredoxing!” Microbes, however, can vary quite a bit and have all kinds of metabolic 11pathways. So by studying how they do it at the bottom of trenches, and in the arctic, andnext to volcanoes we can try to determine how those little bebehs on other planets andmoons might go about their business of eating, and farting, and pooping, and mating, asit were. Now, on some moons, that may be easier to envision than on others, Kevinexplains.Kevin: And I think that for Enceladus and Europa, there probably is some redox chemistry, areductant-oxygen coupling that microbes could harness potentially quite easily. OnTitan, the chemical story there for redox pairing is a little more complicated than… Butwe’ve got to go. We've got to explore. We've got to get out there and just see, becausebiology doesn't care what our hypotheses are, it's just going to… if it can take hold itwill.Alie: And do you think in terms of alien life… Well, number one, let me ask this: Is it correct tocall alien life, alien life? Extraterrestrials? I mean, aren't we aliens as soon as we go toEuropa? So why are they the aliens? What's the proper terminology?Kevin: [laughs]Yes, frame of reference is important in all of these endeavors. If you're anintelligent octopus on Europa and our spacecraft lands there, then to them, we of courseare the aliens, right?Alie: Isn't it weird that we're aliens to someone else right now?Kevin: I love it. Let's just hope we play that Close Encounters music, bom, bom. [iconic five-notemotif from Close Encounters]Alie: And so do you think that when we find life...Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's dive into that a little bit more, but go ahead and saywhen.Alie: Do you think we will find teeny tiny critters or do you think we'll find crazy, translucentmammoths? What do you think we might find?Kevin: A lot to kind of unpack in there.Alie: I know.Kevin: But first let's change that when to if, and that's important, because both outcomes areincredibly profound. I certainly am excited about the prospect of discovering lifeelsewhere. And that's in part because, at a more philosophical and human level, andtaking off my science brain, biology is beautiful. I love lifeforms and seeing how lifeworks. I'm excited by the prospect of biology being out there and different ecosystems,different planets. So I do hope it is a when, but there again, the universe doesn't carewhat we want. 12It could be that life and the origin of life is a singularity. It's only occurred here on Earth.And we are the first and only instance of it. And so if we do go out and explore and wedon't find life elsewhere, that also is pretty profound because that means that life israre. And it also puts an even bigger onus on us to take care of the only life we know. Weof course have to do that even if we do discover life elsewhere. But…Alie: But isn't it kind of like if you're looking for your cell phone and you're like, “Well, Ichecked my purse, it's not there. My cell phone doesn't exist.” And meanwhile, you'relike, “Your cell phone could be anywhere!” Like if we go check places… there's an infinitenumber of places we would have to check.Kevin: 100%. You'll almost never prove a no result. Right. But let's come back to the other partof your question. Were we to find it, would it be small, would it be large, microbial, morecomplex? And this helps me sort of triangulate on one of the aspects of the explorationof ocean worlds like Europa, Enceladus, and Titan that I think is particularly important.And that is that I'm really motivated by the prospect of finding what we call extant lifeas opposed to extinct life. In other words, life that is alive today, life that we could seeand study and understand how it works.And the reason for that is because I'm, in large part, interested in the question of: is theorigin of life easy or hard? Is there a second origin of life in our own backyard here inthe solar system? And the reason for that is because if we discover life in our ownbackyard, if we discover a second origin of life, one that was not seeded by life on Earth,that means that the origin of life is probably easy. Life arises wherever the conditionsare right, and we potentially live in a biological universe. So, looking out at all thoseexoplanets and everything and saying, “Okay, there's a decent chance that since wefound two independent instances of life in our own solar system, the origin of lifeprobably proceeds in many different places.”Aside: So, we’re looking for life in our backyard, i.e. our own solar system, becauseif it arose on its own it would prove that life might be easy, and the universe might befilled with critters. And if it’s still alive, or extant, as opposed to fossilized, we could findout if the building blocks and genetic code involving DNA, and RNA, and the wholebusiness of ATP is, as Kevin says: not the only game in town. Is there another systembesides DNA and RNA? This is like asking, are there other restaurants in yourneighborhood? Are they doing good business? Are they busy? Also, are they pizza placesor it is something totally different, like acai bowls? Now, would Kevin care about, say, ashuttered and abandoned restaurant, like for example, extinct life on Mars?Kevin: I love Mars. I do some work on Mars, um…Alie: I'm sensing there's going to be a ‘however’ or a ‘but’ coming up, like you're breaking upwith Mars right now. Mars, I love you, but...Kevin: Mars is absolutely fantastic. There could be extant life on Mars in the subsurface of Marsand I hope we explore Mars in that context. But right now, our Mars explorationprogram is primarily focused on the past habitability of Mars. And that's for very good 13reason. You look at the geologic and geochemical history of Mars, and we see that threeand a half billion years ago, it had flowing water, rivers, lakes, perhaps even vast oceans,that would have been potentially very Earthlike and great places for life as we know it tohave existed and thrived.Aside: Buuuuuuut? [repeated, distorted to low pitch] Buuuuut?Kevin: Now, today for example, the Mars Curiosity rover is making its way up Mount Sharp inGale Crater, and tomorrow it could turn a corner and see stromatolites. Stromatolitesare textures in rocks that can often be traced back to microbial mats, microbes that haveworked in a consortia and perhaps lived three and a half billion years ago and leftbehind their, sort of, microbial fossil. That would be astonishing! That would be a gamechanger. Like, we'd be jumping up and down. I'd be super excited about that.But there are some limitations. We can't drill into a stromatolite on Mars and search forDNA. We can't do that on planet Earth. DNA, the large biomolecules of life, do not lastlong in the rock record. So then we find ourselves at a crossroads. Are thesestromatolites from a rock on Mars, are they evidence of an independent origin of life onMars billions of years ago? Or are they evidence of life on Earth that was transported toMars, hitchhiked on some ejecta from an asteroid impact, which then seeded life onMars or vice versa? Or was life on Earth seeded by this ancient stromatolite life form onMars and then came here? Earth and Mars have got a long-standing relationship oftrading material.Alie: Let's say, turn a corner, they find a dancing Martian, and it's like, “Surprise! I waswaiting for you to get here. Where have you been?” It's got maybe a CamelBak full ofwater. It's good. Do you think the government would tell us? How soon before, like, a layperson would know?Kevin: Now you're trying to get the real secrets out of me, Alie!Aside: Listen, I’m asking the questions I know that you have. I know you’rewondering this!Alie: But like how soon would that come out, because that would be something that wouldrock every society on Earth, to find out that there are aliens. Right? People would freakout.Kevin: If it was a little marching Martian. Yes. That would freak everybody out. Absolutely. Butlet's be clear, there's historical precedent for exactly this. The ALH84001 meteorite? TheMars meteorite. The Allan Hills meteorite, that landed in Antarctica, and was studied,and could be determined to have come from Mars back in the late ‘90s. And this actuallyhelped catalyze and then initiate much of the current field of astrobiology. Back in thelate ‘90s, there was a big press release and publications about a set of evidence fromstudies of that asteroid, or that meteorite, that have pointed to past life on Mars.Alie: Holy smokes!14Kevin: Yep. Bill Clinton got up and said, “Hey, look at this! How amazing is this?”[clip from YouTube video, President Bill Clinton: “This discovery is confirmed. It will surelybe one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered.”]Kevin: Great job, NASA! And it was incredibly exciting for NASA and the community. Nowgranted, that was a meteorite that landed on Earth. It wasn't a little Martian waving toCuriosity, but even that Martian meteorite created a tremendous amount of excitement.Fast forward to today... And just to make sure that I put a cap on the Mars meteoritestory, most scientists who studied that meteorite think that probably what was seen inthat meteorite was contamination from organics on Earth and potentially microbes onEarth.Alie: Dangit. [Price is Right loser horns]Kevin: Back to your question, if a spacecraft visiting another world such as the spacecraft onMars, or a spacecraft going to Europa, or a spacecraft going to Enceladus or Titan, if itdid find obvious evidence… if biology on those worlds was very generous and madeitself readily apparent, that would just be phenomenal! I hope that everybody would bethrilled and excited. I often get asked, “Well, what then? What good is that? Why shouldwe be spending money on this?”It's like, yeah, that discovery, it's not going to change the way you make your coffee inthe morning. It's not going to shorten your commute. But it really would mark thebeginning of a new understanding, a new revolution in how we think about biology, thescience of biology and the stuff that is us, the phenomenon of life, our very phenomenon.And it's also very exciting in terms of the time in which we live. Galileo couldn't send aspacecraft to Mars to search for evidence of life on Mars, or to Europa, or Enceladus, orTitan, or any of these other places. For the first time in the history of humanity, we havethe tools and technology to do this last great experiment to see whether or not biologyand the phenomenon of life works beyond Earth. So let's get it done. You know, I'd loveto get out there.Aside: So when you think of aaaallliens, just slow your roll. Start small. Maybe thinkof some goofy little blorp bleep microbes instead of, you know, what we all think aboutwhen we talk extraterrestrials: [sped up and mouse-pitched] Why are they alwaysnaked?Alie: Why do you think we have such iconic imagery of these grey aliens with big heads?Where do you think these kind of stories are coming from? Because when we expect tosee aliens, why do you think we expect to see these particular visions?Kevin: Yeah. I don't have a good succinct answer to that. I think really at the heart of it revealssome of our own anthropocentric bias. I'm a tremendous fan of what Arrival did inthinking about life forms that would evolve in much different environments. But I think15the whole phenomenon of aliens, UFOs, et cetera, that kind of stuff, it is interesting.Historically if you look at William James, the varieties of religious experience...Aside: Dr. William James was a Victorian era psychologist who believed in ghostsand telepathy, but who thought that religious experiences can come in all shapes andsizes, from what I gather. Now, this dead psychologist Dr. William James is not to beconfused with the alive ufolgist Dr. William J… Birnes, who is the editor of UFO Magazineand believes that, like an influencer wielding Facetune, NASA airbrushesextraterrestrials out of photos all the time. Anyway, theories have been simmering forcenturies.Kevin: … and the different kinds of experience people had centuries ago that they ascribed todivine intervention, et cetera, et cetera. I think some of those same psychologicalphenomenon also inform the experiences that people have when they think that they'veexperienced something with alien lifeforms, abductions, and all those things. I'm by nomeans a specialist in that. But there again, my interest in psychology has sent me downthose roads many times.Aside: How many people in the US believe in aliens? A 2017 poll showed thatnearly half did, but a slim 16% had reported seeing a UFO. Now, among the believers:Kesha, Nick Jonas, that lady from The Nanny, Kacey Musgraves, Russell Crowe, KendallJenner, and Demi Lovato, who, if nothing else, has admirable conviction.[a very earnest Demi Lovato on Late Night with Seth Meyers: “I believe that there couldpossibly be mermaids, which is actually an alien species that lives in parts of the IndianOcean which we have never explored before as human beings.”]And also Tom Cruise, but, duh. So now Kevin, remember, was a researcher at SETI,listening for signals. Now, I found one very sketchy article claiming that a bunch ofastronauts have reported that the skies above us are just a traffic jam of flying saucersand there’s an alien space station on the moon, but even supposing all of that is true,how would we communicate? Charades?Alie: When it comes to trying to, say, read signals from other planets, other civilizations, howdo we know that we will have the right antenna to pick it up?Kevin: We don't, and so it's a great question. And my friends and colleagues at the SETIInstitute obsess over that kind of question. Even within the frequency space of our radiosearch, there's still so much to explore. Frank Drake, and Jill Tarter, and Seth Shostak,and Dan Wertheimer and others have focused in, throughout the years, on particularwavelengths, where the cosmos itself is quiet and it would make for a good broadcastand transmission in the radio part of the spectrum. But then another colleague of mine,Andrew Howard – who's now at Caltech – and his advisor at Harvard, Paul Horowitz,they were some big innovators on optical SETI.If you think about an advanced civilization… Think about the center of the Milky WayGalaxy. I hope the center of the Milky Way galaxy is like… Well, okay, let's put this in 16context. We are in the boondocks of the Milky Way. We're eight and a half kiloparsecsout. Suffice to say that's a long ways out from the galactic bulge.Aside: That’s right. The densely packed cluster of stars at the center of a spiralgalaxy is called a galactic bulge. Someone please go as one for Halloween. It’s March. It’snot too late to get started on a luminous, starry codpiece and some twinkling, spirallyarms.Kevin: I hope that the center of the galaxy is teeming with life and we've got advancedcivilizations in there. They're darting back and forth in there. There's a galactic internet,the modern version of what Carl Sagan used to like to call the Encyclopedia Galactica. Ihope that is happening right now in the center of our galaxy.Those civilizations would probably communicate with laser beams, with optical beamsdirected star to star, planet to planet, spacecraft to spacecraft, et cetera. It's just moreefficient to send transmissions that way. And so one of the ways that SETI researchersare now looking for signals from advanced civilizations is looking for those nanosecondpulses in the, sort of, visible part of the light spectrum, which so far, nothing but there'sstill so much to search.Alie: There could be aliens sending lasergrams right now? Like, “Party! Party at my moontonight!”Kevin: Exactly.Alie: Okay. I'm going to pose a theory. You can use this in a paper if you want to. It's fine. Justcredit me. But what if dark matter, dark energy is just full of ghosts and aliens.Kevin: Yup. That's, that's beyond my pay grade. [laughs]Alie: We don't know exactly what it is… What if it’s lousy with ghosts and aliens?Kevin: Right. Yes. And to that I say: we are the 4%. Right. Everything that we see, we know andlove is 4% of the known universe. And actually I think it's closer to 1% when youactually consider the particles with which we interact.Alie: If you're going to use it in a TED talk, it's fine. Just put a slide that says thank you.Okay. Are you ready for some Patreon questions?Kevin: Sure!Aside: But before we get to listener questions from Patreon, a quick word from oursponsors, who have allowed me to raise the pay of the folks who help me make Ologiesand also let me donate to a cause of the Ologist’s choosing. This week. Dr. Kevin PeterHand chose to support the work of Traveling Telescope. This is a cause started by SusanMarubona and her husband Chu and colleagues, to share astronomy with schoolkids 17and the general public in Kenya. They say they, “regularly visit both government andprivate schools, and expose students to a variety of astronomy tools and concepts.Giving the students practical, hands-on experience with astronomy is important if weare to inspire young people to be the scientists of tomorrow.” So that is TravelingTelescope and there will be a link in the show notes if you want to know more aboutthem.Now, an additional donation this week was made to Vermont’s Manchester RescueSquad in memory of Peter Hand, Kevin’s father, who passed away last summer. TheManchester Rescue Squad provides 24 hour/365 paramedic-level emergency care viapaid staff and volunteers. They also do CPR and First Aid classes. So on behalf of all theOlogites, our heart goes out to the Hands.[Ad Break]All right, your questions.Alie: Patreon questions. We got a gazillion.Kevin: I’ll do what I can.Alie: It's kind of a lightning round. Shoot from the hip. I categorized them as best I could.Okay. Jasmine Wells, Vincent, Madi Worker and Mike Marlow all want to know: As afirm believer of other forms of life, what's the most probable planet for alien life to existon? Like, what are the most likely places? Europa, Titan?Kevin: Mars is fantastic. Mars is still a wonderful place to look for evidence of past life andpotentially life that's alive today. We'll just have to dig a lot deeper. So I put Mars,Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. And when it comes to the search for extant life, I reallyprioritize Europa and Enceladus for extant life similar to life as we know it. And then ifwe go one layer deeper, I prioritize Europa over Enceladus for a couple of differentreasons.Europa, we have good reason to predict, has had an ocean for the history of the solarsystem. So, it's an ocean that's been around for a while. Enceladus, there's still somequestion marks. The reason Saturn has rings is because some sort of collision, some sortof impact event happened in the neighborhood of the moons of Saturn in the past tens tohundreds of millions of years ago.Aside: Remember Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons? Kevin says that Saturn hashad some draaaama in the last tens of billions of years.Kevin: So did Enceladus form from that? Is its ocean relatively young? We don't know.Alie: Will those rings glom together to form moons eventually?18Kevin: Well, a bunch of it will go into Saturn, and a bunch of it will sort of drift in the otherdirection further out, and stuff will continue to glom onto the existing moons. And soyeah, it's going to continue to be a bit of a pinball game out there in the Saturniansystem.Alie: So many people had the same question and I'm going to say all of their names right now.Elizabeth Gabel, Xuan Wei, Renee Coley, Mads Clement, Moses Bibi, Devon Robertson,Dionne Dabelow, Anthony Stull ...Aside: Also Lani Bouwer, Nathan Ahlgrim, Theodore Vician, Zineera Seth, SarahClark, Jack Gavin, Jordan Werme, Lauren Paul, Erica Kane and...Alie: Tone Rossow all asked: Is there already non-carbon-based life on Earth? What is thepossibility of extraterrestrial non-carbon-based life? Could it be silicon-based? Is thatpossible? What would that look like?Kevin: It's a great question, one that I definitely ponder, one that I don't necessarily have agood answer to. What we know of life so far is that life needs a good balance betweenlarger information molecules that can, you know, store the software. For us that's DNAobviously. You need those molecules to be made of elements that can bond together andare stable, but you don't want those molecules to be too stable because you got to tearthem apart and translate them and figure out what they're saying. And then the RNAand the worker bees of life as we know it, has to go off and build the proteins and makethe business of life.So from a feasibility of life using other things like silicon, et cetera, every time I go downthis road, it's like, gosh darn it. Carbon is just such a good element for, not just bondingwith itself and bonding with other elements and forming long molecules, it's also reallygood, albeit, at temperatures and pressures that are found here on Earth and, frankly,many of the other planets. It's also really good at forming molecules that occupy thatnice sweet spot of ‘you can be large and stable but not so stable that you can't be brokenapart and replicated or metabolized and stuff’.And all you gotta do is look at the rocks on Earth. The rocks on Earth are made of stringsof silicon. The silicates, the silicon link to four oxygen atoms and then various metalsbounded in there. You know, if silicon-based life could have evolved on Earth, it hadplenty of opportunity. So water and carbon-based life, it's a pretty darn good solution.Using the word solution appropriately.Alie: [laughs] A rock-solid pun there. [ba-dum-TSH!]Kevin: But I would love nothing more than to go to a world like Titan or see some bigmothership in the sky that comes down with silicon-based life. And keep in mind ofcourse that silicon-based life could be the future of life as we know it. When we thinkabout our mushy bags of water and carbon, a silicon-based life that we then create andadvance could obviously have a much greater staying power galactically than thecarbon-and water-based life.19Aside: So that’s like a [slowed down, distorted] maaaybe?Kevin: It's a great question and I love to think about it. But every time I go down the rabbit holeof chemical feasibility, carbon pops its head up, “Oh yeah, you think you can beat me?”[laughs]Alie: Carbon’s like, “Yeah, I got this in the bag.”Kevin: Exactly. I think that's exciting to see that your audience is interested in that question.Alie: Other people had questions about the oceans. Trying to settle the debate, Oceana Rhyseasks: Are deep sea creatures aliens? I think they are. And also are we looking at thedeep sea to provide any clues of what could exist on other planets?Kevin: Great questions. The first one is, as alien as they are - and I've gotten to see some ofthem up close - and as astonishing and beautiful and bizarre as they are, they are verywell connected into our tree of life. They are based on DNA and RNA in the ATPparadigm, with proteins, et cetera. So yeah, they are not different from life as we knowit.Are we looking at our own oceans to see whether or not our search for life elsewherecan be informed by life that works in these deep ocean environments? The answer is,absolutely. And it's something that I'm very passionate about and I've been fortunate tobe able to take part in some of that exploration and science.The depths of our trenches, the Mariana Trench, the New Britain Trench, the JapanTrench, all these places that are in what we call the Hadal Depths, deeper than sixkilometers down in our own ocean. Those environments are incredibly poorly explored.There's so much great work yet to be done. And from an astrobiology standpoint, theyoffer a great bridge for learning about the environmental conditions that could affect thehabitability of these distant worlds. It's entirely plausible that we could go to a worldlike Europa or Enceladus and discover that it has the right liquid water, chemicalconditions, et cetera. It is “habitable” but not inhabited. And that could be because theorigin of life is a bottleneck. The origin of life could be quite hard. So, going to these deepocean environments, going to places on Earth that serve as analogs for the conditionsthat we might find elsewhere is part of NASA's astrobiology program.Alie: All right. I'm going to keep blazing through these. Ready? Sophia Garbos, great question:Do you think ‘they’ have been here and left? What are the chances? Have aliens beenhere and bounced?Kevin: I don't know. If they came and went, they haven't left so much as a paperclip. And as ascientist I need hard evidence. So as much as I have read anecdotes and [DJ airhorns tothe tune of X-Files theme] want to believe, to use the X-Files… At the end of the day,gimme an alien paperclip or as they say, “Bring back a fork from the mothership.”20[clip from The Little Mermaid. Ariel hands Scuttle the seagull a fork: “What is it?” she asksin wonder. “It’s a dinglehopper!” he replies]Alie: That brings me to someone... Two people had the same question. Sophie Cousineau andHeather Shaver wanted to know: Are you more of a Mulder or a Scully? Are you in theMulder fan cult?Kevin: I just, yeah. I'm the hybridized love child of the two of them.Alie: Both of their DNAs combined into a carbon-based waterbag known as you. Justin Griggsand Kacie Wight, first time question askers, wanted to know: What's the coolest gadgetwe currently have? And if you were given unlimited funds, what kind of imaging orradio equipment would you use?Kevin: Well that's a really interesting question. Layered into that question is that when wethink about the search for life elsewhere and actually doing those experiments… andthis is what I spend much of my day’s doing. I'm the pre-project scientist for the EuropaLander mission concept. This is a mission that is far from green lit. Our team ofscientists and engineers has been working on this for many years. NASA currently has amission going to Jupiter to study Europa. That's the Europa Clipper mission. It's amission that will fly by Europa and do remote sensing, look as it makes those flybys, totake images, do spectroscopy, do ice-penetrating radar studies, it’s an absolutelyamazing mission and the data is going to be incredible.I'm a co-investigator on that mission. And hopefully someday following on that mission,we can put a landed vehicle on the surface to dig up some material and look directly forsigns of life, use a microscope to look for morphologic indicators, little cells if they exist.Use things like mass spectrometry or infrared or Raman spectroscopy, to look fororganics and other things.And so to your listener's question, in the biotech world here on Earth, we've made tonsof progress in sequencing DNA, and 23andMe, and all this stuff. But when I think about apayload for exploring a world like Europa, we can't use DNA-based analytical systemsbecause then we might miss life even if it's carbon- and water-based. It may well not beDNA-based. It would be really interesting if it was because that would set the stage forsome evolutionary debates and convergence versus contingency and DNA arisingindependently more than once.Aside: I think what this means is, would DNA appearing in extraterrestrialorganisms be total chance, or developed because circumstances kind of steeredevolution toward that efficient coding formation again? Who the hell knows, people?Literally no one. At least on this planet… Well, maybe Kesha knows. [Kesha, her voicesped up to chipmunk velocity, sings: ‘’Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna dieyoung”]Kevin: But we certainly don't want our instrumentation and our measurements to require thatlife form to be based on DNA.21Alie: Right. It's like taking a VCR somewhere. Yeah. They got laser discs.Kevin: Great. Great analogy to do that. Exactly. Yeah. And that's important to appreciate with alot of the biotech, they're feeding into that instrumentation, our primers that latch ontoDNA in different ways. And so, yeah, it's like a VCR.Alie: You got a thumb drive in an eight track. What the hell you gonna do???Kevin: Exactly.Alie: A lot of people, including Lauren Murray, Sarah Clark, Timothy Dykes, Joe O'Bannon,Jane Joy, Jenni Hoover, Jeffrey Katz, all kind of wanted to know, in Jeffrey Katz’s words:Do you think intelligent aliens would look somewhat like us? As we evolved, somethings seemed efficient, like bilateral symmetry for extremities, to use to manipulatetools. Are they going to look like us?Kevin: Instead of answering the question, will alien life look like us, I like to do the experimentof what if we re-ran life on Earth again, would we end up with Homo sapiens? You canlook at different convergent and contingent events in evolutionary history. Obviouslyone that's great to examine is the impact event that extinguished the dinosaurs. What ifthat didn't happen? Would the dinosaurs have evolved into intelligent communicatingcreatures with useful thumbs and all that? And Star Trek certainly has examined thosekinds of scenarios.I think there's a case to be made that early on in the evolution of intelligence, if you donot figure out how to use tools, and how to build shelters, and how to propagateinformation beyond the single generational timescale. In other words, the printingpress, the Internet and all of these things. If you don't develop that relatively quickly,you will become extinct just by the nature of the fact that the cosmos is full of hazards.And eventually a large impact event will wipe you out. [a female voice very politely says“Kaboom” and “No thank you”]Kevin: Fast forward to us and now clearly we are at an inflection point.Alie: Yes!Kevin: We're messing up the home planet. Climate change is going gangbusters and planetEarth is saying, “Hey, we're going to shut down this subsystem.” Our life support systemis being challenged by our own existence. Coupled with that, we could still have animpact from outer space that wipes us out. And so in my opinion, the clock is ticking onus to get some real intelligence and learn how to be a longer-lived species.If we re-ran the clock, would you end up with bilateral symmetry? I think yes. Wouldyou end up with eyes? I think yes. You can look at the evolution of eyes and it's occurredsome 50 or more times in different organisms on Earth. Obviously, photo sensing makesa lot of sense. The senses that we have, smell and taste, are variations on chemicalsensors, and that's very useful. I get intrigued by some of the sensory modalities that are 22not as ubiquitous; sensing the polarization of light as bees do; sensing magnetic fields;echo location as obviously bats, and dolphins, and other creatures do. Is there a world inwhich those sensory modalities become more prevalent in the primary biologicalparadigm of a planet, perhaps?Alie: Ooh, yeah. Who knows what an ultrasound antenna would look like?Kevin: Well, and that in part goes to Arrival, and the way in which those creaturescommunicated through sound and the circular, timeless inkblots.Aside: From ink blots to… the Great Filter. Several listeners, including DionneDabelow, Tyler Q, Donald McLeod, Christopher Barley, and Katie Boyd, asked about theGreat Filter, which is the notion that the reason we’ve got radio silence fromextraterrestrials is that our kind of advanced civilizations are either a one off, just us, orthey die out before they're capable of communicating with one another. Kevin says thatif we make it through our own population growth and carelessness with the planet andaren’t just randomly boned by a space rock, there is the prospect of finding anothercivilization if a signal is out there. But, he says, on the flip side:Kevin: I'm sure many of your listeners have probably read The Three Body Problem and thattrilogy, which is a fantastic trilogy and the second book called The Dark Forest, whichreally gets into the question of, do you actually want to reach out and make contact? Isthat a safe thing to do? And I think that's a very important question to ponder. From atransmission standpoint, do you really want to transmit? I don't think I have a clearanswer right now. I've got thoughts on both. Yes and no for transmitting, but short ofthat we can certainly do a heck of a lot more listening. That is something that I advocatefor and hope we do more of.Aside: So it’s like texting your ex versus just lurking on their Twitter late at night.[drunk sounding female voice slurs “I read it!”]Alie: A few people asked, Christopher Barley, Lale Stefkova, and first-time question-askerRebecca Leigh Richardson: Does the Fermi Paradox make you sad?Kevin: The Fermi Paradox make me sad? Like where are they and why haven't we found themyet? Yeah. In some ways it does. To the extent that it makes your listener sad, Isympathize. But, people like Jill Tarter and the folks up at the SETI Institute serve asgreat inspiration. And when we talk to them about this stuff, I was like, “Well, we just…we really have not listened to enough. We haven't looked.” We know where to look. Wejust have not yet had time or the computing power to really search the haystack for theneedle. So we've got to keep searching.Alie: Keep working. You're employed forever. Okay, one last question from listeners. Greatquestion, asked by Joe Porfido as well as Chris Baumann, Danny Kang, Jenny Kovacic: Inyour opinion, did the tardigrade come from outer space? What's the deal withtardigrades? Should we send them to Mars? Let’s talk tardies.23Kevin: Tardigrades are those little water bears. They are curious little creatures. And they are,again, DNA-based, RNA-based. We can fit them into the tree of life on Earth very well. Sothey make sense. That said, they sure are curious little creatures, aren't they?Aside: A tardigrade, by the way, is a teeny tiny micro animal that looks like if afuton cushion had 8 stumpy little legs and then a vacuum for a face. They’re 530 millionyears old at least and they’ve been everywhere, from the Antarctic to the deep sea tovolcanoes and they can survive, like, a decade without any water, and crazytemperatures, and space radiation. If you soak a piece of moss in water and you lookunder a low power microscope, you might be able to spot one! But yeah, Kevin says,[snarky voice] “Sorry, y’all, they’re Earthlings.”Alie: Last two questions I always ask: what is something that is the shittiest part of your job,the thing that you dislike the most about what you do or about alien life or maybe someflimflam that you'd like to debunk, some myths that irk you? What gets your goat whenit comes to astrobiology? So annoying.Kevin: Honestly the thing that that comes to mind of course as a scientist, the ubiquitousanswer is, we hate writing proposals, begging for money, getting rejected. That's justpart of the life cycle of a scientist across the board. That's not specific to astrobiology. Iguess the sad part is for all of the exciting stuff that we discussed here today, boy, I wishwe could just get going with it. It is through the generosity, and dedication, andexcitement of the taxpayer who makes NASA and all of this stuff possible. So if you wantto see us move faster, just keep on being interested in this stuff and express it to yourvarious folks who help make the high-level decisions that are well beyond my pay grade.Alie: Tweet about NASA. That’s what we gotta do.Kevin: And the search for life and astrobiology.Alie: What about your favorite thing about astrobiology or your job, the best?Kevin: I've got a lot of great colleagues and we love brainstorming, forcing each other to thinkout of the box. I have a position at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, an amazinginstitution that is a pioneer in the field of ocean exploration. And I go there and I visitcolleagues like Chris German, Julie Hoover and others. And we just have a blast forcingeach other to think out of the box about how to explore planet Earth, and understandlife on Earth, and how to apply that to worlds and wonders beyond Earth.So that kind of intellectual popping the popcorn is a lot of fun. And at JPL, I get to do thatwith engineers. I'm just a silly scientist with crazy ideas. I can't do anything without theengineers who figure out how to actually implement the ideas of myself and my fellowcolleagues. They're the ones who are actually getting these missions done and makingsure that when they fly by or orbit or land on a distant world, we get those bits back thatcan revolutionize our understanding of how the universe works.24Alie: If someone wanted to be an astrobiologist, what would you tell them? Where do theystart?Kevin: It's a great question. In the field of astrobiology today, there's biologists, chemists,geologists, geochemists, oceanographers… my own background, physics and astronomyand geological environmental sciences. I also did a masters in robotics. It takes all kindsto get this sort of - well, let me use a few buzz words; interdisciplinary,multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary - kind of research done. And so what I tell studentsand folks interested is, within the framework of sciences that feed into astrobiology,follow your passion - biology, geology, physics, astronomy, et cetera et cetera -chemistry, and enjoy that fundamental research and then extend and bridge it intoastrobiology.Alie: Smart. That's just the sound of so many people changing their majors right now. Thankyou for studying aliens.Kevin: Thanks for having me here to talk about aliens.it’s that person who almost accidentally took your latte when it came ready at the coffeeshop and then made that age-old dad joke, “Heh, see what happens when I don’t have my coffee,”Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. So, this is a subject that absolutely zero peoplehave asked me to do, which is why I’m doing it. I also want to note right up top, I loved doing thisinterview, I hated making this episode. I cried several times just writing it, researching it. Todestress, I Googled pictures of ferrets who have blackheads on their tails because that’s apparentlya thing. Did you know that was a thing? Anyway, it was gross, but it was a welcome diversioncomparatively.But the topic and the work of this episode are so important. What this ologist is doing is saving livesand rebuilding ones that have been torn to tatters, so if this is your first-ever episode of Ologies,just, warning: this one’s not funny. Like, probably at all. All the other ones have weird sound effectsand jokes about turtle dicks, and knowledge plus some buffoonery. This one’s a bit serious.I’m skipping the usual business. Thank you for your reviews, I read them all. Thank you to all thepatrons who support the podcast. We’re going straight in.So, victimology. Yes, it is an ology. It’s just not one that you hear about much. Etymologists thinkthat ‘victim’ comes from the Latin word for ‘occasion’, and initially it meant “a living creature killedand offered as a sacrifice to God or to supernatural powers.” In the 1600s and 1700s, the meaningof ‘victim’ morphed into someone who was just killed, or hurt, or oppressed.So victimology is the study of the psychological effects and the experience of victims of crime. Soyou might think, “How is that not criminology?” And just like all cacti are succulents, not allsucculents are cacti, victimology is part of criminology, but criminology itself looks at the crime. Itlooks at the causes and the consequences, the management, looks at the criminal acts. The word‘crime’ comes from the root word for judgment. And often we see a headline, a mugshot, maybesome kind of stoic courtroom plea, or some closed-circuit TV frames, even, unfathomably,livestreamed footage of a bloodbath. There’s plenty of information on killers and there’s a thirst toknow why they do what they do and how we can avoid their surprise attack, the fate of maybelanding in their crosshairs.But what about the fallen? What about the survivors? What about the people we see only maybe insome smiling photo that was grabbed off their Instagram? Or whose stories are never told becausethey’re kept as secrets for decades? That’s what victimology looks at. Who gets hurt? Why? Andwhat can help them?A little context. In 2017, a criminal justice major posted a photo from a textbook written by thisologist, and it inspired the Vox essay entitled, victoriously, “I’m the professor who made BrockTurner the ‘textbook definition’ of a rapist.” That’s right. Next to a paragraph defining rape is BrockTurner’s mugshot, detailing his actions and his shockingly short three-month prison sentence. Andat the end of the article, this ologist’s bio mentioned she was the previous year’s recipient of theBonnie S. Fisher Victimology Career Award from the Division of Victimology in the AmericanSociety of Criminology. And immediately I added her to my spreadsheet of dream guests. So a yearlater, on a trip to Colorado, we met up in my hotel.2Now, I did this interview months ago and I’ve been holding it because I try to space out the heavierepisodes. This, without a doubt, is the heaviest. It makes the surgical oncology and apocalypseepisodes seem just like an afternoon game of checkers.And people love true crime. But does anyone want to hear about true trauma, and true recovery,and true advocacy? I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe by the time we’re done hearing about thisprofessor’s work, you might be applying to transfer to her school. But, content warning, of course:we discuss sexual violence, abuse, homicide, trauma, in her utmost informed and respectful way,but it can be hard to hear. We settled in to talk about the media distortions of crime victims, theunexpected path to her PhD, the glories of math and stats, statistics on all kinds of different groups,and who’s getting hurt, and what to do to help them.So breathe deep, and get ready for the real scoop with professor, researcher, author, speaker, andVictimologist, Dr. Callie Rennison.----------Dr. Callie Rennison: Is that okay?Alie Ward: Yeah, no, that’s great. And so you are a victimologist.Callie: Yes.Alie: How long have you been a victimologist?Callie: Oh gosh, it’s probably been, at this point, about 20 years. I got into it, like a lot of things inmy life, I stumbled into it accidentally and then found I loved it. So, I started when I went tothe Department of Justice and started working with a big data set that deals withvictimization and it’s where I learned everything, and started answering questions, anddigging, and being curious.Alie: And can you describe what the difference is between criminology and victimology?Because I hadn’t heard of victimology until I started doing some research and found you,and I was like, “Whaaat is this? Tell me everything.”Callie: Right. Well, I wouldn’t say they’re different as much as that it’s a subset of criminology, sodepending on who I’m talking to, I might tell them I’m a criminologist or that I’m avictimologist. And all that means is that I’m looking at criminal offending incidents,interaction with the criminal justice system. My focus is more on the person who’s beenvictimized, not on the offender. Like, a really common interaction I’ll have is somebody willgo, “Oh, you’re a criminologist, like CSI?” and, “Oh, my favorite serial killer is this person” –which I think’s a little weird, you should not have a favorite serial killer – and then I’ll tellthem, “No, I’m really focused not on the offender, I’m focused on the people who areharmed.”Alie: Right. I feel like that is very unique these days in terms of the way that we interact withcrime.Callie: Right, right.Alie: Can you tell me a little bit about your background that led you to criminal justice?Callie: Yeah. Again, accidents, stumbling in the dark. My PhD is in political science, and I wasdrawn to that because of the quantitative elements of it, gathering data, analyzing data,answering questions, and when I graduated with my PhD, I ended up taking a job at theDepartment of Justice, dealing with victimization, and I had… I’ve never… To this day, I’venever taken a class [laughs] in criminology or victimology, but I started answering, I think, 3questions that normal people have. I mean, I was raised in Texas, and there was a certainidea about how we saw crimes, offenders, and if people thought about victims, what theythought about victims. And so, I just started answering basic questions, thinking I knew theanswer, and what I pretty much found is everything I thought I knew was wrong.[“Surprise!”]Alie: Really?Callie: Yes. So I wanted to write reports, hopefully for other people like me, to understand who ismore likely to be victimized. When I give talks, a lot of times I start with a pop quiz and I’llput up ten true/false questions and most people get them all wrong.Alie: What kind of questions? And what kinds of things really shocked you when you starteddigging into it?Callie: Oh, I think… I mean, I held onto a lot of stereotypes, like who’s victimized more? Well, olderpeople, clearly. That’s not true. And who’s victimized more? Well, women, clearly. Andthat’s also not true. Specific types of violence, yes, women are more likely to experience, butoverall violence? No. That’s men. I’d see something written about young, black, urbanmales, for example, and it’s always written about their offenses, but very little writtenabout the fact that they’re victimized at some of the highest rates. And so that was a part ofwhat I wanted to do with my work is to bring this to people’s attention, about who is beingvictimized? And that’s what I continue to try to do.Alie: Why do you think that we are focused on certain victims and not others? As a culture, atleast, as a media culture?Callie: It’s our culture, and I think it’s still messed up and it’s still dominated by a lot of incorrectstereotypes. I mean, one of the things that I always think about is blaming the victim, andyou’ll hear a lot of people say, “Don’t blame the victim.” And I agree, don’t blame the victim.But let’s not kid ourselves either. We blame the victim a lot. We blame young black menwho are killed for doing nothing, except being black, walking down the street. But if youblame, say, a white, beautiful person for being harmed, then people really get upset.So I wish as a society we would start viewing all victims the same. These are all people whoare, like, violently attacked and it wasn’t their fault at all, and I wish we could have thatcompassion for all types of people, regardless of age, or race, or ethnicity, or other types oflifestyle, but we’re just not there as a society yet.Aside: So, quick aside. The field of victimology came about in the 1940s/1950s as a wayto study how victims partly brought this shit on themselves, and one article I read said thatthe pioneers in the field back then – who, by total coincidence, I’m sure, were all white men(like, what are the odds of that?) – they were just kickin’ around theories about how peoplewho suffered wounds and losses brought it on themselves by, say, having an alive body tokill.Now, women were sometimes held responsible for misunderstandings that evolved intosexual assaults. Now, these theories, thank god, began to be dismantled in the 1970s.Victimology became less about blaming people and more about crime prevention, victimsadvocacy, recovery.And as long as we’re here looking at time capsules of historical and modern-day horrors,let’s have a look at that definition of rape. So, before 2012, the FBI defined rape as “thecarnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.” So in the eyes of the law, until a 4few years ago, it was penises only, and men couldn’t be raped. Now, in 2013, the FBIexpanded that, removed the word “forcibly,” because, hello, drugged, date rape, etc., and itnow reads – and this is not easy to hear; it shouldn’t be – it reads, “The penetration, nomatter how slight, of the vagina or anus, with any body part or object, or oral penetrationby a sex organ of another person, without consent of the victim.”Now, in communicating how vital it is that all 50 states recognize and adhere to thisexpanded definition, Callie has noted historically, rape has been treated as a crime againsta man’s property, his women. It initially was never considered a crime against the actualperson who was the victim.Over time, the definition of rape has expanded to include marital rape, non-consensualpenetration between married individuals, and Callie says that it was only in the 1970s thatmarital rape exceptions were removed from the law. So we put human beings on the moon,we had color television sets, and disco, and Camaros, and yet there was nothing illegalabout raping your spouse.Callie notes that the laser focus on women as victims sexually is also tragically neglectful.Callie: And almost like we have to – and this is super crude – but protect the vagina at all costs.When we look at violence against women, it’s so often focused on, say, rape and sexualassault and intimate partner violence, which is really important, because that’s beenignored and continues to be, I think, minimized. But women are also robbed, they’reassaulted, they’re shot, and they’re killed. I’d like for us to do a better job at looking at thefull person, no matter who they are.Alie: Was there anything in particular that drew you to this? Did you have family that were incriminal justice, did you see friends victimized at all?Callie: You know, at the time I would say no, but it’s very interesting, the household I was raised inwas very rules-oriented, and I have a brother and a sister, and I think we’ve all continued tobe very rules-oriented and, you know, right and wrong. My brother is an FBI agent, he gotinto it after I did. At the same time, we were kind of on different paths, so our paths crossprofessionally every now and then.And as far as families, I mean, I don’t know that you could talk to anybody who doesn’thave some of this in their families, especially intimate partner violence. You know, thatclearly has happened in my family. Not with my immediate family, but with thegrandparent level and cousins. You know, when you’re dealing with rape and sexualassault, you can’t throw a rock without hitting somebody who’s experienced that. So, yeah,I think it’s all around us and I think a part of it is – and especially as I’ve gotten older – I’mtired of us pretending it doesn’t happen, making the people who experience it kind of keepquiet and internalize blame and shame, and I think we need to say, “This happens a lot, thevictims aren’t to blame. We should be able to speak up without being worried about howpeople perceive us.”Aside: Quick side note: according to stats from the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, over 10 million people yearly experience some form of intimate partnerviolence. Now, if there’s any good news, it’s that a 2014 study using the Bureau of CriminalJustice statistics showed that violent victimization by intimate partner violence was down,significantly, from 2005. And from 1993 to 2017, the rate of violent victimization in generaldeclined 74%. Although there was a slight uptick the past two years.5But getting back to Callie’s history. Her academic path took her from a bachelor’s inpsychology and two masters’ in sociology and political science to a PhD in political science.It’s far from the tailoring career that she once considered.Alie: A dressmaker?Callie: A dressmaker. Thank god, I’d be totally unemployed. both laugh]Alie: And so, going to your scholastic background, were your family, were they PhDs, were theyacademics at all?Callie: No, not at all. My dad dropped out of high school and went into the Navy, my mom didfinish high school. And while my parents encouraged us to go to college, the fact is, if youhaven’t gone, you don’t really get it. How do you do it? How do you choose it? How do youknow what to take? And I had no intention to go to college. I graduated high school early,walked away, saying, “I will never write another paper again as long as I live.” And Iremember the exact date and where I was when I thought that.Aside: She says it was December 14, 1981, her last day of high school. She was walkingthrough the parking lot and thought, “I will never write another paper as long as I live.” Shelater joked that the universe must’ve had some other plans for her, because:Callie: Pretty soon, I realized I wanted to take some math classes, because in high school girlswere pointed toward non-math things, like home ec – which was a waste of time for me –so I wanted to take some math and I wanted to take some Spanish classes, so I went to thecommunity college and ended up getting a community college degree. And then I ended upin bachelor’s, and then just kind of stumbled into a master’s, and another, and a PhD.But I really think an important point and something that I think about a lot when I dealwith students today is that even in college, I don’t think I “got it.” I didn’t get that I couldstudy something that I loved and could make a career out of. I thought I was getting adegree that then would help me in my job since I worked my way through college, and Iknow it sounds bizarre, but it made sense then. And as I was getting ready to complete mybachelor’s degree, one of my professors, a sociology professor at the University of Houston– his name’s Jon Lorence and he’s still there – asked me, “What are you going to do withyour degree?” And I said, as people in my position would say, “Well, I’ll try to get a betterjob.” And he said, “You would be wasting your talents if you didn’t consider graduateschool.” angelic choir]And it really was, I’d never even considered it. I don’t think I really understood it existed.And that simple question made me think, “Oh, maybe I could do this.” And so I signed up fora master’s and, I mean, that led me on my way. And it truly is – in my intro book, Iacknowledge this, and I dedicate the book to somebody who totally changed the trajectoryof my life – and it’s something that I hope I can do to some of my students when I recognizegreat talent or curiosity.I mean, the smartest people don’t finish school, the most curious do and the most tenaciousdo, so I hope that I can do that to some students, too. I think if you follow what you love, ittakes you to where you need to be. So that’s certainly been my case.Alie: Did you ever think you would be Dr. Rennison?Callie: No. Mm-mm.Alie: laughs] Really?6Callie: Never. Never! And you know, it’s fine when people call me Dr. Rennison, but I’m a prettycasual, comfortable person. If you guys could see me, you’d know that. both laugh]Aside: Dr. Rennison, by the way, has a very easy way about her. She’s so casual and sowarm. She arrived in comfortable, Colorado fleece, her long hair loose, and about heracademic and career path, she advised anyone with a passion and a curiosity to put theirnose to the grindstone, get busy, work hard, and they can do it, too.Alie: And what is your day-to-day work like as a victimologist? Are you digging into data, are yougiving talks, are you teaching, are you doing interviews? What is that job like?Callie: Yes. both laugh]Alie: All of the above?Callie: So many things. Every day is really very different. I’ll get people sometimes say, “Hey, whatday is a good day of the week to do something?” and I’m like, “It is different every singleweek.” I might be working with students on theses or dissertations, I might be preparingfor a talk, I might be writing a book chapter, putting together a couple more books. Sodoing a lot of writing, dealing with data, doing analysis…yeah. It is all over the place. That Ican switch gears every day and address deadlines is something that I thrive under.Alie: When people look at victims of certain types of violence or certain types of assault, do youfind that certain victims all, kind of, respond the same way depending on what they’ve beenthrough?Callie: No, I think there’s a little bit of a stereotype about that, too, which I wish we could breakup.Aside: She notes the myth and a misconception that:Callie: “All rape victims need to be completely devastated, sobbing, and acting that way,” when, infact, a lot are not. And so if they’re not, people start doubting them, and that’s not right. Agreat analogy I heard many years ago that I repeated is that it’s like going to a funeral. Yougo to a funeral, and you’ve got the widest variety of responses. Your crazy uncle’s overthere laughing, this one’s over here sobbing, that one over there is, you know, looking attheir phone. Everybody handles it really differently and I think we have to get better as asociety at realizing that so that when somebody’s not responding in the way we think theyshould, that doesn’t mean that we should doubt their experience. It’s just how they have todeal with it.I think some people are impacted more deeply or differently than others, but it doesn’tmean that, “Oh, well it was no big deal to them.” It’s violence, right? We don’t have thesesorts of questions when you take a big population of people who have been hit over thehead with a weapon. We’re not doubting some of them. But when it comes to some types ofviolence, and again that’s like violence women predominantly experience, there’s a lotmore doubt wrapped around it. I think society keeps forgetting that this isn’t, say, sex gonebad or a relationship gone bad. This is violence. Somebody was violently attacked. Period.Alie: Do you think that people of color and women do tend to get doubted more than otherswhen it comes to being victims of crime?Callie: Absolutely. The criminal justice system, although it is a lot better than it used to be and Ithink it’s continuing to make strides to get better, yeah, there are really big problems withthis, and this has kind of been my big deal this last year, doing a lot of talks about rape and 7sexual assault, is that we have got to believe people. I love the Me Too movement becauseit’s giving people the opportunity to step up and say, “Me, too,” where the criminal justicesystem has failed them.The CJ system is very different for people of color compared to whites, and it’s different formen and for women. There’s zero doubt. Zero doubt.Aside: According to a 2017 study on violence victimizations that excluded homicides,men and women were statistically about even, but people of color had higher instances ofbeing victims. And though we tend to hear more about white women being victims ofhomicide, according to one long-ranging report, spanning 1980 to 2008, white womenwere 35 times less likely to be the victims of a homicide than a young black man. But thosejust aren’t the stories we hear about.And according to several studies, what draws us to some narratives is a build of tensionand a release, in a safe environment, and the desire to learn how to escape or prevent asituation we might find ourselves in. So what happens, by the way, with such an activenews cycle and social media, when we do hear about violence inflicted on others? Howmuch keeps us rightfully aware and how much is too much?Alie: How do you feel about people maybe absorbing the traumas that they hear about and beingaffected by other people’s victimization and trauma? How are people compartmentalizingthat, or how should we, or should we not compartmentalize that?Callie: Yeah, no, that’s a great question. Definitely… Even the positive elements of Me Too arehurting some people, right? Hearing a lot of these things said in public might be triggeringcertain people. And the way that they’ve handled their experience or that they’ve been ableto tuck it away and learn to live with it, having people at the highest offices of this nationsaying certain things, and then seeing a large population – a disturbingly large proportionof our population being okay with it, and somehow thinking it’s a joke – that’s reallyharmful to people who have lived through this sort of violence.I wish we could be a little more sensitive to it. And this isn’t about being a snowflake, right?This is about people who’ve gone through really terrible events and we need to think aboutthat. And before you make it a joke… I mean, we don’t go to a party and make a joke aboutsuicide. Chances are, somebody at that party has had a family member who’s done this.Sexual violence, intimate partner violence – and I mean for men and women because it’snot like only women experience this – we have to be a little bit more sensitive to thosetraumas.Aside: Now remember, until 2013, the FBI didn’t acknowledge that men could even beraped. And in the 2011 National Gender Discrimination Survey, transgender and gendernon-conforming people reported higher rates of harassment, physical assault, and sexualviolence in a variety of settings.Now, a 2018 report found that of 22 transgender people killed in the United States thatyear, the vast majority were young transgender women of color, which is why, over time,factors like representation and inclusion literally saves lives. So what can help someonefeel safer and what can help someone heal?Alie: When it comes to being victims of a crime or feeling just victimized in general, have yourstudies revealed anything about what can prevent someone from being in a situationwhere they might be vulnerable or help someone heal from a situation where they’ve feltpreyed upon?8Callie: Yeah, I mean, some of the work I’ve done… but it’s a large body of work, I’m just like a littledrip in the bucket. And yeah, I mean, we know a lot of things. One of the things that I do alot of talking about has to do with initial disclosures. We know – and I’m just going to takesexual violence again as an example – that when people are sexually victimized, they dogenerally tell somebody. Do they tell the police? Not so often. This last year, I think thenumber was 22% of rapes and sexual assaults were reported to the police. This is notwhere people generally go.But they’ll go to, say, a friend, or a family member, and how that first person responds tothat disclosure is key to how that person deals with it and what they do from there on. If Icame to somebody and said, “I’ve been sexually victimized,” and they’re like, “Are you sure?Maybe it was a misunderstanding,” or – and these are all things I’ve heard people say –“Well, you know, you’re single, what did you expect?” Those are really terrible. And whatthe person who’s been victimized internalizes is, “Never tell anybody else about this.” Andthen they’re left to deal with it on their own.And while some people can deal with this on their own, I find that a lot of other peoplecan’t, and that’s why we know that some of the responses to this can be PTSD, or eatingdisorders, or depression and suicide, in some cases. I think people have to be really carefulthat when somebody comes to you and discloses any sort of victimization, to stop, to listen,to say things like, “You didn’t deserve this. How can I help you? Thank you for trusting me.”That’s what we need to get better as a society at doing. And I think we’re getting there, butwe have a long way to go.Aside: Callie says that if someone discloses, a good strategy is to acknowledge it, toaccept it, and to let them know they’re not to blame for it, and to find out what they want todo, but don’t try to take control. Let the person who’s gone through it drive the boat, shesays, on the next step. Just be there to help and support. And the next question, I feel likeshe must get a lot, so I asked it.Alie: And what about preventing yourself from becoming a victim? I feel like that’s… sighs] I hatethinking about that because you don’t have control a lot. I mean, I myself was mugged bytwo guys with knives in my 20s. It was obviously a very surprising event. “That’s anunderstatement.”]And it impacted me greatly for years, in ways that I didn’t even fully, really understand.And I did some things in the moment that helped my survival, but in terms of preventing it,I was walking down the street in the middle of the day. But when it comes to crimestatistics or victim statistics, is there… Do people ask you that? Like, “What can I do so thisdoesn’t happen?” And there an answer to that?Callie: Yeah, that’s another really great question. And that’s kind of where we’ve been focused fora long time and now we’re seeing a really great shift to more, like, “Don’t be rapey. This isthe bigger problem. Don’t be rapey and then rape doesn’t happen.” Things like that. But it isreally true. We do a lot of things in all of our lives to try to minimize bad things happening,so there are certain things that we can do, but can you make yourself victim-proof?Absolutely not. Absolutely not. You know, you see people who are victimized when they’remonths old, and elderly people, and people who are at home, and people who are out. Imean, women are more likely to be victimized in their own homes than anywhere else.So, there’s nothing you can do to make yourself totally safe, but I think that just thinkingabout it, trying not to put yourself in situations that could possibly be dangerous. But again, 9if somebody’s victimized, then the last thing I want to do is say, “Well, you know, youprobably shouldn’t have done that.” That’s not true. Because people who commit offenses,they’re not dumb. And one of the things I’ll talk to a lot of students about is, they’resurprised to find out sexual violence rarely occurs with a weapon. It’s about 7%-ish, it’ssingle digits, which is shocking because if you watch television, they all have knives, youknow? That’s pretty uncommon in reality.But I’ll ask students, “What is it that offenders use?” And the answer is confidence andtrust. And they’ll do something like, “Hey, let’s run up to my room and get something,” andonce you’re alone, then there’s trouble. So, no, you can’t really totally protect yourself, but Ialso don’t want people to think, “Oh my gosh, I’m doomed every day.” Just be aware of yoursurroundings. The same things you do to try not to be robbed, or not to be swindled, orsomething. It’s sort of the same thing.Alie: And what about for African American men? What do you think systemically could change toprevent them from being victims of crime?Callie: Yeah, that’s super tough. I mean, one of the things that we know in the field of victimologyis one of the key characteristics that increases risk of victimization is income,socioeconomic status. Poor people are victimized at far, far higher rates than people withmore resources. So, it’d be nice if I could say, “Be richer,” but that’s not that easy, as weknow. It’s just really challenging.I don’t know. It’s easy to say, “If you hang around people who are committing offenses, yourrisk of being offended against is greater,” but when we’re in a neighborhood, when wedon’t have the opportunity to move or leave, or we’re around certain people, our risk ishigher. I don’t feel like I have a good answer, I’m sad to say.I mean, education is one of those things tied to victimization risk. It’s income, it’s education.This is when I talk to kids at community colleges and just say, “You have to go on and getyour degree.” There’s a lot of talk these last couple of years about degrees not beingimportant and I could not disagree more. They are important. And for anything, yourvictimization risk goes down. Education matters. It opens doors. It gives you opportunities.Alie: And in those communities where there is violent crime against people of color, do you findthat reporting also goes down, or is there less reporting if it might be within a community,or if it might be, maybe, violence that someone they’re familiar with?Callie: Yeah, it’s really wild when you look at the numbers, because it’s very complex. Forexample, one of the things that shocked me most when I got into the field is seeing thatwhen there’s violence committed against African Americans, it’s actually more likely to bereported to the police than when it’s committed against white people. That makes no senseto me. And I still am trying to figure this out.And some people say, “Well, it’s the avenue they have to make it stop, so they might makecalls.” But I think too, given some interactions in the CJ system and people of color, they’regoing to be less likely to contact the police. We saw this happen, actually, with domesticviolence, things when we had mandatory reporting. It used to be that you called the police,somebody would get arrested, sometimes nobody would and that was wrong. But nowpolice might come and then there’s a mandatory arrest, and so what have we found? That alot of women, especially, won’t call the police, because they might very well be the oneswho got arrested, and that’s a problem.10Alie: It’s also what we’re seeing with the Black Lives Matter movement and violence againstpeople of color, knowing that they are more likely to experience violence but also morelikely to endure repercussions maybe of a criminal justice system that is weighed againstthem. It’s like, what do you do?Callie: Right. Yeah. I don’t know. I mean, there’s a great book that was written years ago, lookingat gangs in the Chicago area, and I thought one of the cool elements of this book was that itdidn’t only focus on gangs as the bad things they did (and certainly gangs do bad things).But also because the criminal justice system had abandoned this complete area, it’s almostlike this little microcosm society, so the gang took on the policing parts of it. So, I thinksometimes you get some of that that happens in some smaller areas, where, “Yes, maybewe don’t call the police, but we’ll take care of it ourselves,” which ends up looking like moreviolence sometimes. But I mean, we have to do what we have to do, and I think, again,blaming a group for doing something like that when structures of greater society haveabandoned them, that’s not really fair. That’s not fair to do to them.Alie: Of course not.Callie: I was also going to mention too, one of the – and I wish I had many more hours in the day,but – looking at Asian Americans and their victimization rates. Their numbers, year afteryear after year, they’re really low. I mean, really, really low.And one of the things my data can’t capture is the influence of, say, culture. So the questionis, “Is it really that low, or is there something culturally about this community – and ofcourse this is a large generalization – that they really won’t call the police and report it, oreven tell a field rep who’s gathering data about it?” We can gather the data as good as wecan, but then there are cultural elements about who’s going to tell us what about that andhow much does that drive these different rates. It’s an interesting puzzle.Alie: Right. I mean, if you were trying to quantify car crashes or butterflies, that data would be somuch more straightforward, but because it depends on divulging really painful informationthat has repercussions, that’s got to be so frustrating for you.Callie: I mean, you probably know people who’ve been victimized who’ve never told the police.Maybe you’re the only person they’ve ever told. I’ve definitely – there are people that haveexperienced things who’ve never revealed, that never will reveal it. I find it interestingsometimes people criticize the research, because, you know, “Well, you can’t possiblycapture it all.” You’re absolutely right. And the only way I could actually do that would bepretty unethical, right? Like, sodium pentothal and make them talk. laughs] That’s notgoing to happen. The best we can do is try to establish some rapport, ask questions in asensitive way, and deal with it.But there are still going to be people who are like, “Nope, not sharing,” especially, I think,there’s some generational elements of it, right? You look at some senior citizens, I knowsome that I see experiencing intimate partner violence and they won’t do anything about itbecause their fear of not being a couple is far greater than their fear of being abused. It’s sotragic. And I think younger people are a little less likely to tolerate that. We’ve done a goodjob about educating and letting people know that, “No, people don’t get to hit you, orbelittle you, or entrap you by hiding your money,” things like that.So it is still really scary, and it’s still scary the first time anybody discloses, right? How isthat person going to respond? Is it worth it? I don’t know. Again, I really love the Me Toomovement for the people who choose to say something, that they can say it and see an 11entire world saying, “Yes, me too,” and they realize they’re not alone, and they’re not theonly ones, and they weren’t to blame. I just think it’s one of the most positive movements.Aside: So, side note. While the hashtag #MeToo began trending in October of 2017following Harvey Weinstein’s sexual abuse allegations, the Me Too movement actuallystarted over ten years earlier by Bronx-born political activist Tarana Burke, and she says,“The Me Too movement started in the deepest, darkest place in my soul.” She was workingin a youth camp and a young girl named Heaven pulled her aside and began to disclose toher horrifying abuse done by her mother’s boyfriend, and Tarana felt unequipped to handlethe disclosure. She shuffled her off to another worker, and she’s written that she will neverforget the look on that young girl’s face. She says, “I’ll never forget the look, because I thinkabout her all the time. The shock of being rejected, the pain of opening a wound, only tohave it abruptly forced closed again. It was all on her face.” She says, “I couldn’t even bringmyself to whisper, ‘Me, too.’”Now the Justice Department statistics show that around 40% of Black women report beingthe victims of coercive sexual contact before the age of consent, but for every Black womanwho reports her rape, it suggested that at least 15 do not. Tarana Burke now runs Just BeInc., which is a youth organization focused on the health, well-being, and wholeness ofyoung women of color, and she was named Time’s Person of the Year in 2017 for beinginstrumental as a silence breaker.Alie: Do you find in your life that a lot of people confide in you?Callie: Oh gosh, yeah. I have a girlfriend, and we’ll travel sometimes, and some of the early travels,I finally realized I had to say something because people would be like, “What do you do?”“I’m a criminologist, I’m a researcher, I’m a victimologist, I look at a lot of violence againstwomen” – I look at a lot of things but violence against women gets a lot more attention. Andimmediately, total strangers will tell me about rapes they’ve experienced or domesticviolence they’ve experienced, or are experiencing. And I realized a recent trip to Arizonawith my friend, she’s not accustomed to this and I finally had to say, “Hey, I apologize. Thisis, like, my every day.”Every time you teach a class, you’re going to get multiple disclosures. It’s a part of it. Whichis a kind of interesting thing about my work, the reality in my work, my research, we do thebest we can to measure this stuff, right? We have estimates of rape and sexual assault, orintimate partner violence, or robbery, or any of these things. But they’re the best estimateswe have. But in reality, I often say, “Find me somebody, especially a woman aged 50, whohasn’t experienced sexual harassment and sexual assault.” It’s unusual. It is ubiquitous, nomatter what the rates say. The rates are as good as we can do, but they’re imperfect.Alie: How do you handle those disclosures? Do you feel like you’re pretty well equipped, or doyou compartmentalize, or do you ever just have a day where you’re like, “Whew, I’ve got alot on my shoulders”?Callie: Kind of the same thing, listening to them because they… I think they found somebody theythink is safe to disclose to, so they can unload this, you know? And the most recent one wasa woman – I’m going to guess she was 70 years old – and we came together in a completelydifferent context, and I got the feeling she’d never told anybody about this, and some of thishappened when she was a child. So I listen and do exactly what I said earlier, in terms of,you know, “Thanks for trusting me with this,” and, “You didn’t deserve that,” and, “I’m 12really sorry you’ve had to live with that.” And then, depending on the situation, I’ll oftensay, “Do you want some resources? I can get you some information for some resources.”There’s a lot of 1-800 numbers and other things, and today with the internet, it’s prettyeasy to find a good resource. But I just want to make sure that they don’t need more thanjust to talk about it, and I’ll sit and talk about it. But it is fascinating. And people in my field,they’ll all tell you the same thing, that they do it. You know, you’re on a plane and the nextthing you know, you’ve got somebody disclosing and things like that, and I think I’m prettygood at it – probably I should knock on wood. I’ll leave today and get a disclosure thatreally jacks me up or something. laughs] Because it can happen, yeah.Aside: I asked Callie about resources that would be like first aid for victims and shementioned that there are 800 numbers suited to different situations, so I looked and on theDepartment of Justice’s website, I found a list including Childhelp National Child AbuseHotline, National Domestic Violence Hotline, National Runaway Safeline, National HumanTrafficking Hotline, Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN), and I’ll put a link tothese and others in the show notes.Callie: I have a lot of bizarre beliefs, but one of them is, age 30, we should all be required to go seea counselor or psychologist, because we can all benefit from it, laughs] and there should beno shame in that either, right? But to go to talk to somebody, and to get it out, and workthrough stuff, I think’s really key.What I totally believe is that carrying it inside of us all this time is never beneficial. It’snever beneficial. Ever. So we’ve got to be able to get it out and have people hear us, havepeople help us, and learn to be okay, you know, with all of it.Alie: And why do you think victims blame themselves? Do you think that we or they are trying tomake sense of what has happened and trying to put the control back in their own hands?Why do we find ways to say, “I must have invited this. This must be my fault somehow”?Callie: You know, that might be a part of it for some, but I think it’s because society blames them.You tell certain people, or you hear judges say things on the stand about, “What were youwearing? Why were you out? Why were you alone? How much did you have to drink?” So Ithink, unfortunately, society’s first response is always a very blaming sort of deal and thenit’s internalized.What I see a lot of is, I think, people trying to make themselves feel safe, right? If I say – andthis is not something I personally would say – “Well, I would never have worn a skirt likethat,” I think that’s the person thinking, “Well, I can prevent it from happening to me. Youweren’t smart enough to do that.” And that’s just wrong, because there’s some greatexhibits that go around – I think last time I heard about it was in Kansas – where all it is arethe clothes that sexual assault and rape victims were wearing when they were assaulted.And, you know, they’re up on the wall, and what do you see? You see sweatpants, you seepajamas, you see all kinds of things. So this notion that what you wear brought it on is justwrong. But I think society still will say that.Aside: This exhibit, by the way, is called, “What Wear You Wearing?” created by thedirector of Kansas University’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Education Center, JenBrockman, and Dr. Mary A. Wyandt-Hiebert of a rape education center. Now, next to onecasual outfit is a story of a survivor, who says, “I missed a couple of days of work after ithappened. When I told my boss, she asked me this question: ‘What were you wearing?’ And 13I said, ‘A t-shirt and jeans, bitch. What do you wear to a basketball game?’ And I walked outand never came back.”Callie says that people internalize these judgments and we’ve got to just keep fighting backagainst that and call them out because nobody has asked to be victimized, she says. Nobody.Callie also told me that she taught a criminal justice course titled, “Murder in America,” andshe says that it was admittedly named that way to draw students to take it, but her secretgoal was to make sure none of them left with a favorite serial killer anymore.Callie: I mean, reading the details, and making it very clear that there are victims, right? It’s not allabout this weirdo, it’s about victims who were skinned, and tortured, and I mean, justawful. And you could talk to a few of my students who to this day can’t eat a pot roastbecause of a particular movie that I showed them. laughs] But I was very happy to knowthat when they left, they got it. It’s like, walking around with a shirt with Ed Gein on it, orTed Bundy, that’s not cool. They killed and tortured people.From a criminal justice/criminology standpoint, in terms of universities and gettingmajors, it’s very beneficial, because everybody wants to be a CSI investigator or forensicscientist, so it’s great to get… maybe it sends people to college and they learn neat things.But, yeah, it’s gross. It’s awful. These are human beings. They have mothers and fathers,these people have sisters and brothers, and you know, they might’ve been the person tocure cancer and all of that’s lost. But they’re not deemed as valuable somehow. It is really,really disturbing.Something that I’ve been trying to figure out the best way to say it, okay, so you’ve gotpeople who are, like, really obsessed, and the serial killers and what they do, and theyknow everything about them. Their victims are people. And I try to frame it as somebodywho's been torturing animals, they keep taking kittens and skinning them and makingthis… And very quickly, people will be like, “Oh my god, that is horrible.” So why is it we cansee the horror of it when we’re dealing with animals – and yay, I’m glad we can – but whenit comes to people-victims, it’s different.Aside: Apart from the obvious post-traumatic stress disorder, there are so many moreinsidious and lasting effects of violence and victimization, on not just the person whoexperienced it, but those around them, too. Fallout from violence can be multigenerational,can be very emotional, and can also be practical and financial.Callie: If you have somebody in your family who was maybe murdered, you can also get thatassistance, which is needed, because a lot of times, say, a parent is murdered, people losejobs, homes get foreclosed, just all kinds of terrible things. So it tries to help bridge it, butit’s definitely not enough. I’m sure you could talk to anybody who’s been through that andsay, “Yeah, it was a drop in the bucket. It was useful, but I need so much more.”Alie: And now, what kind of people do you find are drawn to study victimology, as opposed tomaybe just criminology, or what people are drawn to this subset? What are they passionateabout?Callie: I’ve never been asked that question. It’s really good, so I’m trying to do this scan of all thepeople I work with who I think… I mean, I think one thing clearly they all have in common,even if there’s some disagreements about part of it, I think kind of what I’ve said is just thispassion for people who’ve been victimized and taking care of them. I mean, the history ofthe criminal justice system is one that we didn’t really even include victims in.Alie: OOF!14Aside: I’m sorry for my guttural groans here.Callie: They were treated… and I’ve got an introduction to criminal justice textbook, and I talkabout this. At best, they were treated as a witness. They were never treated as anythingmore than that, and that’s changed over the last few decades. Is it great? No. But we’reheaded in the right direction. So I think a lot of people who are just passionate about takingcare of people who’ve been harmed and caring about it. And a lot of these people who workin this area have experienced it themselves or have very close family members who have,but not all. So I think it’s just compassionate people who want to make a difference andwant to make it better.I mean, when my grandma was younger and in not-the-best-situation in her marriage, shehad nowhere to go. As a woman, how’s she going to leave with children? How’s she going toown a home, get a job, get a credit card, or do anything? She had to just live with it.Aside: Just a quick reminder that up until 1974, it was perfectly legal to deny a woman acredit card unless she was married and could have her husband cosign. 1974. That erawhen raping your wife was also still plenty legal.So if anyone’s ever tempted to ask, “Why didn’t they just leave?”, we are barely in an erawhen the law would even allow women that independence and authority over their ownlife, their own finances, their own body, and we’re barely in an era when men are evenconsidered a victim of some of these traumas.Callie: And I’d like us to see that that doesn’t happen anymore, that if somebody’s in a badsituation that they have the ability to get out of it. And I think that’s what everybody – thatwould probably be the one universal part of it.Alie: Is being able to get out of a bad situation.Callie: Right, right. Like, who wouldn’t want that? And it’s kind of neat to see, too, that even in mycareer, taking on and recognizing problems that have always been around – let’s say sextrafficking is a great one, or human trafficking more generally – that this is something thathappens, it happens in this nation, trying to get people to recognize it, to understand whyit’s bad. Again, why is that important? Well, it’s not good to enslave people. And reallyworking toward changing that.But I will say this, there aren’t enough victimologists. I would hope that we could get morepeople to go to school, and to study this, and to get engaged, whether they’re out asadvocates, or in the CJ system with this good frame of mind, or becoming researchers, weneed it. A group that I’ve done several pieces on, but I get frustrated that it won’t gettraction, is American Indians. And their rates of victimization are the highest. They blowAfrican American rates of victimization out of the water. They’re incredibly high.This is where somebody will usually go, “Yeah, well, tribal lands are problematic.” This isn’ton tribal lands. These are people who self-identify and are throughout society, and theirrates are astronomically higher, and there’s so little being done about it. I mean, there arepeople out there working super hard and passionately, but there’s only so many of us. So Ikeep hoping, you know, it’s like, I need some people to grow up and become victimologistsand that be their focus because it’s a lot of low-hanging fruit, and research, and answers,and help that can be done. I think there’s lots of groups like that, too.Aside: I looked into this, and it’s gutting how much higher the rates of victimization are.In the 2017 Bureau of Justice statistics, rates for what’s defined as serious violent 15victimization, i.e. rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, the instance ofvictimization for those identifying as Indigenous populations – Alaska Natives, NativeHawaiians, other Pacific Islanders – is over twice that for other groups.There are two hashtags, #IndigenousWomenRise and #IdleNoMore, that seek to raiseawareness about victimization in these groups, and artist Jaime Black has helmed a newSmithsonian exhibit called the REDress Project and it features 35 red dresses hangingoutdoors, bright, they’re stark against these bare winter trees, they’re blowing in the wind,getting soaked by rain against this Washington, DC, backdrop. So if you happen to be inWashington, DC, have a pop over, take a look at that. And when it comes to governmentauthority, what can be done about victimization?Alie: How do you think we can change the way that police officers are trained, or they’re…laughs] you’re like, whew – so that they are interacting with victims to be more helpful?Callie: Yeah, I have some strong feelings about this. And I know… Listen, I am not a police basher. Iam not. Are there bad policemen? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, there are. But I think one of theproblems is what draws people toward policing. And again, I’m going to go to the media.And I’m going to go to the – and I know this is like really an old people movie now, studentsdon’t know what it is anymore – but like Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood growling: “Now youknow why they call me Dirty Harry.”] Or this “cops kicking people’s heads in.” That’s notwhat policing’s about, and it’s never been about that. But if that’s what’s drawing peopleinto policing, those are the wrong people.There’s a man named August Vollmer who back in the late 1800s and early 1900s – I wouldfangirl him if he was here, he’s dead, though – but he’s the father of American policing. Andback then, he started the first criminal justice college at Berkeley. He started the AmericanSociety of Criminology. He said police officers need to be trained, and they need to betrained as social workers. Because the fact of the matter is that while sometimes physicalstrength is a part of policing, a lot of it is social work, it’s communication, it’s de-escalation,it’s working with and understanding people, and I don’t think there’s enough of that stillhappening.Aside: Callie says that she would love to see the requirement that police officers hadmore training, or maybe a degree in sociology, criminology, victimology. So now, switchinggears, what about people who aren’t victims, but play them?Alie: When it comes to power and abuses of power, how are you reacting to the wrong peopleplaying the victim, or using a manipulation to be like, “I’m being victimized”? clip from TheOffice: Michael Scott, “This is like the Blair Witch Hunt Project.”] both laugh]How do you as a victimologist deal with seeing the role of victim being twisted and abusedlike that?Callie: That’s really cool because one of the… A lot of times when people ask me what I do, I don’tsay ‘victimologist’, because the response I too frequently get is, “Oh my gosh, everybody’s avictim these days. Wah, wah, wah.” And my response when that’s happened is, like, “Iknow, those people who are murdered and raped, they are big babies.” Because it has beenco-opted by a group that I don’t really understand the need to be that. And it minimizes thetrue violence and victimization that victims have experienced.Aside: Callie says that despite the nature of her work, she likes to believe that there areno bad people, just people who do bad things. But she concedes there may be a few 16exceptions. Now, in terms of how people cope with the aftermath of a violent event, shesays different people handle it very differently. She has a girlfriend, she explained:Callie: Her name is Jennifer Schuett, I talk about her in my book, she’s been in the news a little bit.When she was eight, she was abducted from her room, and raped, and nearly decapitated,and left for dead in a field.Alie: Oh my god.Callie: Twenty years, cold case, and it was finally solved. And Jennifer’s really remarkable in thather way of dealing with it is that she’s a speaker, she talks about her victimization, talksabout being a survivor, and in fact, she would probably slug me in the arm for saying‘victim’, because that is a sensitive issue, victim versus survivor. And I use victim because Ideal with people who are killed, as well – I can’t call them survivors. And Jennifer handles itin a really cool way and I admire her way, but, man, it is not everybody’s way.Other people, to call them out and say, “Can you talk about your victimization?” would bethe worst thing I could do. I think everybody has to go at their own speed, their own time,and their own way, and maybe never forgive, or maybe forgive. I mean, there’s certainthings in my life that I don’t know that I would forgive, but have just learned to live with,and I don’t let it eat me, or something, and I imagine that’s true for a lot of people.Alie: When it comes to victims and survivors, there’s more than just the person who experiencedthe act. I mean, there are… it’s multigenerational. If you’ve got someone who has beenmurdered, their children, their grandchildren who never met them, are going to beaffected, right?Callie: Right, and even just if, I mean, there’s some research that shows, say there’s a rape that’shappened, that a lot of times – or even the murder of a child – that that marriage ends indivorce, that there are other consequences that happen that are pretty big and prettydamming. You know, secondary victim – if you were to see your boyfriend assaulted orsomething, how traumatic that would be, even if nobody laid a hand on you. The secondaryvictimization is very real, and that’s why in the intro book I’m part of, I say somethingabout, “Nobody is untouched by crime.” At a minimum, we as taxpayers are paying moneyto fund a huge criminal justice system. But just personally, everybody’s been touched.Alie: And do you think that the criminal justice system is doing enough to prevent furthercrimes, or do you think it’s just super fucked? Like, our prison system, is it making thingsworse, is it making anything better?Callie: Yeah, I think it’s pretty super fucked.Alie: Okay. both laugh]Callie: I mean, we need to do more on the front end, right? We need to do more about economics,we need to do more about education, we need to do more about opportunities. And thiswhole “pull yourself up by the bootstraps,” yeah, that sounds really nice, but if you’re livingin a city that has no businesses, and no public transportation, and a crappy educationsystem, that’s way more challenging versus somebody who is born to wealth, and privilege,and all these things. We’re running really different races. So I think the criminal justicesystem is far more reactive than proactive, and it would be nice to take a lot of that moneyand put it on the front end to try to prevent offending and victimization.I mean, the prison complex is dreadful and the new administration is privatizing prisonsagain. We were actually moving away from that. The state of Kentucky had completely 17gotten rid of their contracts, and everybody’s moving back toward it again. Why? Because itreduces crime? No. It doesn’t reduce crime. We know it doesn’t. It doesn’t help anythingexcept it enriches people who benefit from that. It’s the worst.Alie: agonized sigh] That’s devastating.Callie: It’s just sacrificing people for money and it makes me sick.Alie: So where can we get a dose of hope? How can we make things better? What can we do onthe front end? I mean, I know that we know that men are victimized as much if not morethan women. Probably more perpetrators… male?Callie: Absolutely.Alie: What can we do for the dudes so that they don’t lose their minds and victimize people?Like, what’s going wrong there?Callie: I think there’s a lot of ideas. You know, is it testosterone, is it psychology, is it culture? Andit’s probably a little bit of all of that. Again, that’s not totally my area. But I think that wehave to hold people accountable when they’re doing stuff, but I think we also have to teachthem, right? It’s big change we’ve seen over the last few years about rape. What constitutesrape? This definition’s changed over time. Somebody who maybe thinks rape can’t happenbetween married people, has to involve a penis and a vagina, they might be engaged inbehavior they think’s totally okay when in fact it’s not, it’s rape, and you’ll go to prison forit. Well, you should go to prison for it, often don’t.Aside: Brace yourself for some grim math. According to RAINN, out of 1,000 rapes, only230 get reported to police, 46 of those lead to arrests, nine are prosecuted, and less thanfive of 1,000 rapes lead to incarceration. So out of 1,000 rapes, 995 rapists walk free. ButCallie offers another grain of hope.Callie: One of the neat things that I’ve seen happen over the last few years is some of the work thatI’ve done that’s gotten a little more press dealing with rape and sexual assault, sexualharassment. It used to be that I’d get emails, and some of them would be pretty hateful, andit always had the “hope you get raped” email –Alie: Oh my god!Callie: I know, I’m just like, “Oh, another one! Put it in the folder!” And I don’t see that as much.But a really promising change that I do see is that men are writing, and they’re writing tosay thanks, and they’re writing, “I’m glad we’re looking at this.” And so, I’m seeing it shift alittle bit and I always try to really acknowledge the fact that men experience this stuff, too.It’s very easy to focus on women because, from the numbers we have, they experience it athigher rates, but I also think there’s a lot of good reasons that men don’t want to comeforward.If a man’s been sexually assaulted, or he’s been raped, he even faces a few additionalhurdles than women do, right? A woman comes forward, you’re going to get blamed andshamed, possibly, not believed; where a man, he’s going to have his masculinity questionedor his sexuality questioned, and that’s really harmful. We shouldn’t do that. And I won’t besurprised someday, maybe when I’m on my deathbed if I get a lot more years, that thosenumbers equal out a little bit and we see that men feel more free to come forward and say,“I was raped. I was raped when I was six,” or here in school, or in a sports deal. It happens,and I think that they’re kept quiet from the patriarchy and this toxic masculinity stuff, thatwe’re not fully letting them be the full people they are, they don’t have to prove their 18manliness by harming other people, things like that. That would be a fabulous change. Itwould benefit everybody. It would be great.Alie: Can we do a rapid-fire round?Callie: Oh, goody!Alie: Do you have a minute?Callie: I have all day.Aside: Okay, before we get to Patreon questions, a quick few messages from sponsors ofthe show who help make Ologies possible and who definitely make it possible for us todonate to a charity of the ologist’s choosing each week. Now, instead of one, though, we’regoing to do more than one. I think we’re going to do five charities this week.First up is a donation to RAINN.org, which is the nation’s largest anti-sexual violenceorganization. RAINN created and operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline and carriesout programs to prevent sexual violence, to help survivors, and to ensure that perpetratorsare brought to justice.Next, a donation will be made to Tarana Burke’s Just Be Inc., which is a youth organizationfocused on the health, well-being, and wholeness of young women of color. They say, “Inthe face of media, music, and pop culture that increasingly diminished the importance,worth, and esteem of girls and women, particularly women of color, our organization dealsspecifically with the range of issues teen and preteen girls are faced with daily. Ourprograms center around empowerment and guidance for girls as they grow and begin todefine themselves.”We’ll also be sending a donation to CommonJustice.org, whose mission is to develop andadvance solutions to violence that transformed the lives of those harmed and foster racialequity without relying on incarceration.Also, a donation goes to IWGIA.org. They are a global human rights organization dedicatedto promoting, protecting, and defending Indigenous peoples’ rights.And one more, on a personal note. My boyfriend never got a chance to meet his maternalgrandmother. She was murdered when his mom was just twelve years old and that loss isvery present in their family’s lives. And his mom, Christine Mason, grew up to be a speakerand an author, a total badass, a victim’s advocate. She wrote a book about her experiencecalled Indivisible and she’s on the board of an organization called GRIP, Guiding Rage intoPower, which works with offenders in the California state prison system, and she is avictim-offender liaison.Again, her book is called Indivisible and I want to thank Christine Mason and their familyfor giving me much better insight on the ripple effects of violence and changing the way Iprocess stories like their family’s and even my own narrative. So another donation will begoing to Guiding Rage into Power.And one of the things that brings Callie great joy is parrots, and she recently lost her parrotDale, and I know she works with AllParrotsResuce.org, so we’re going to be sending them adonation, as well.Okay, so here are some sponsors who are making those donations and this podcastpossible…Ad Break] 19All right, and now, your questions.Alie: So Tyler Q wants to know: Are there any truly victimless crimes?Callie: I don’t think so. I absolutely don’t think so. Right now, we’re talking about some whitecollar crimes and people go, “That’s victimless.” No, it’s not! People lost stock money,people lost jobs. So, no. Coming to prostitution – and this is a really interesting place,because there’s a camp that says adult women can make these choices, if they want to be aprostitute or not, and I do agree with that. However, where do adult prostitutes comefrom? Often sex-trafficked children. And so if you’re a sex-trafficked child, your ability tomaybe go on other paths of life has been cut off, so then I struggle with it.So, no, I personally don’t think so, and even if you want to broaden the definition more, say,even that secondary victimization, maybe the individual involved in something is like, “It’snot hurting me,” but how does it affect a spouse or a child or something? So, no, I don’tthink there are any victimless crimes.Alie: Jennifer Dorset wants to know: I’m interested in the trauma portion of being victimizedand how that can be passed on generationally – think Holocaust, slavery, or even justmigration or political upheaval. Do these things affect future generations in a way that’sbeyond just a culture?Callie: Oh my god, that’s such a great question.Alie: I know, Jennifer Dorset!Callie: I wish, Jennifer, I was a smarter person than I am. laughs] Well, other than culture, I thinkabsolutely so. Even some things I’ve read about alcoholics, right? So, say your parent’s analcoholic. The way you’re raised is different, and there are problems, but then even if thechild of an alcoholic has children, there are consequences there. So I think it’s culture butit’s also some socialization and maybe some fears and things like that. My best guess, beingas smart as I am, I think so. That’s a fabulous question. I hope she’s in graduate school andpursuing a degree so she can get out there and help us. laughs]Alie: as if over a PA announcement: “Jennifer Dorset, you have been called to action.”] RachelCasha wants to know: What can we do to stop the criminal from receiving what seems to bepraise and glory as well as the media spotlight while the victims and survivors get verylittle attention, and sometimes even blame?Callie: I feel exactly the same way. In my intro book, I talk a lot about the role of the media, and I’mnot a media basher either. I wish the media would focus more on the victim and theconsequences of that, and their children. And, yeah, we might show a picture of somebodyand say, “And they left behind three kids,” but let’s hear more and let’s talk about what wecan do more versus focusing on the offender. So I wish the media would get involved withit more.Aside: Callie noted that when she writes with her colleague, Mary Dodge, that they reallytry to establish the importance of the victims’ experiences. So victimology has come a longway since its finger-pointy, 1940s beginnings.Alie: Anna McDavid and Maria Kumro both wanted to know more a little bit about why victimblaming is a cultural epidemic, and what’s the best way to change victim blaming?Callie: My guess kind of goes back to what I said earlier. I think for a lot of people, if they feel theycan blame the victim for what happened to them, then they can falsely protect themselves 20from being victimized. I think that’s a large part of it, which is just not true at all. And I haveseen people who have engaged in victim-blaming and then I’ve seen them go throughvictimization, and they struggle almost more because they have to come to grips with theirbeliefs and to understand, “I was really wrong and have done this damage, too.”I think we just have to keep talking about it, keep being supportive, if somebody comes toyou, saying the right thing, getting them help, and saying it. “You are not to blame for this,you did not deserve this.” I don’t care if you are in a tiny skirt and high heels and a sparklybra, you don’t deserve to be victimized. Any of it.Aside: She said just try your best to be supportive and empathetic like you would be to afriend who might be grieving a death.Callie: It will never be the same. Restorative justice kind of talks about this, which is a great wayto look at some of these things, that we’re going to try to restore the victim. I love that idea,but I also realize there’s no restoration, it’s never going to be the same, it’s going to bedifferent, and how do you go through life with this different world? It’s still got good things,but it’s different. I hope that makes sense.Alie: It does. Alyssa Bean and Joyclyn Vincent both had kind of similar questions off that note:How often does revenge and justice help, and does the prominence of vigilantism andrevenge fantasy in pop culture have an impact on how real victims think of their situation?Do we see too much of people getting revenge and we think, “Ah, that’s what’s going to helpme”?Callie: Maybe so. And I mean, I’ll even admit on some things in my life where I’ve got some prettyfantastic revenge fantasies. “Vengeance.”]But I’m not going to engage in that. For some people, it might make it feel better, but I don’tthink for most of us it will. I don’t think so. But I think you can think about it all you want.laughs] If that’s helping you, then do that, but you’ve got to find another healthy way todeal with it, too.Aside: This next question made such an important point and I’m so glad that you askedit, my dear friend.Alie: This is an interesting question from the Lorax, a.k.a. Forrest S. It says: In cases where anactual trauma is not present, what are the most common ways that PTSD can arise? And hesays: Personally, growing up gay in a conservative Christian household has led me to quitea battle with PTSD-like symptoms. In non-trauma-based PTSD, what are some of thetherapies that have led to the most promising results?So, if someone maybe doesn’t consider themselves a victim, because actual trauma wasn’tpresent, is there still trauma if you’ve, say, grown up in a household that you didn’t feelaccepted you?Callie: I would say to think about how you’re defining trauma. If you’re just thinking about thephysical attack, okay, maybe there wasn’t a physical attack, but let’s look at domesticviolence or intimate partner violence. There’s the physical part of it, but there’s theemotional, there’s the psychological, and there are some people that can tell you some ofthe psychological and emotional abuse is worse than some of the physical. I don’t want tosay one’s better or one’s, you know, whatever, because they’re all terrible, so I would saythere is still trauma there. And again, PTSD isn’t my big area, but… I don’t know, I wouldsay think a little bit more about it and broaden his idea about what trauma is, and that, 21yeah, that is trauma. Not being accepted, being in a household where your parents didn’twant you, or accept you, or like you – that’s awful. Does it get worse than that? I don’tknow. That’s pretty terrible. So… I’m sorry.Alie: And I imagine in terms of victim statistics, the LGBTQ community has got to be staggering.Are there certain resources or ways you’ve seen that get any better, any worse?Callie: There’s a lot more attention getting drawn there. And let me say this, too: It’s not thatvictimologists haven’t thought about it, but it’s a data issue. You have to get enough data towork with to do things, and it’s hard. We don’t have a master list of the LGBTQ community,and over recent years, more and more people are more comfortable coming out. When I didthe sexual misconduct survey at my university, you had the option to note that, and manypeople identified in different ways, but there wasn’t enough data to do much with it.The research that’s out there does show that this group does experience victimization incertain ways at higher rates because people see them as out groups or bullied, so they doface some specific things. Imagine being a transgender woman who’s been raped, and thenhaving to deal with the criminal justice system and hospital. Nobody can tell me they’regoing to have the exact same experience as somebody who’s not transgender. So yeah, Ithink there’s a whole lot of additional hurdles and issues that they’re going to confront, andthere are more and more places that are popping up to help.And maybe Forrest doesn’t want to call it trauma, and that’s okay. I think that as a victim orsurvivor, you can call it whatever you want. I think people working in the field, the criminaljustice system, need to call it by specific definitions, but as that victim or survivor, if callingit trauma is really uncomfortable, don’t do that. But I also wouldn’t want somebody tothink, “Well, I didn’t really experience anything, so I don’t know why I’m going throughPTSD.” Yeah, that’s a terrible experience, you did experience that, and I would acknowledgeit. Again, it’s not all about physical, at all.Alie: You mentioned the word ‘bully’, and that’s the first time that word has come up in thisinterview, which led me to think about the way that we look at bullying in schools. I feellike when I was going through schools, if you got bullied, it was like, you’re shit outta luckand there wasn’t really anyone to go to, but I feel like we’re becoming much more aware ofbullying.Is bullying getting worse? Are we getting better at calling it out? And what do you think isthe best way for kinder-victims who are maybe getting shit on at school?Callie: I don’t know about the numbers. I think it would probably be this sort of situation thatwe’re calling it out more and recognizing it, so if there were… My particular data doesn’tfocus on bullying specifically, but it probably looks like it’s gone up, but that’s more ofrecognizing and disclosing, and I am glad schools are dealing with it.When I just think back on my own personal experiences – so these are just anecdotes – isthat the bullies that I know came from families that bully. So this is the one where you findthe parent is… this is where they’re learning this behavior. And I think sometimes thebullies don’t know other ways to interact, and this isn’t to minimize what they’ve done, butI am glad schools are taking care of kids who are being bullied, because… The same thing, Icould remember back in school, they’d put us in this big hall called the Mall before they’dlet us into classes. Every morning it was the same scenario, same kid being bullied by thesame bully, and everyone just sat around and looked at it. It was almost just normal.Whereas today I hope that that gets called out.22Aside: Some statistics show that because of increased attention to bullying, the rates maybe going down. Now if you have a little one who’s getting bullied at school or is having ahard time, having a hard time making friends maybe, look into the app Sit With Us. It wascreated a few years ago by a then-young teenager Natalie Hampton. It’s been downloadedlike 100,000 times. It helps kids find a table at school to sit at, and they can specify theirinterests and find nice, cool, welcoming buddies. Again, it’s called Sit With Us, and I ampersonally hoping that Natalie wins a Nobel Peace Prize or something.Alie: Bader AlShawaf, John Worster, and Jessica Oster all kind of asked: When someone disclosesthat they’ve been a victim, what’s the best way that we can be supportive without scaringthem away or pushing them off?Callie: I think just thanking them for trusting you, not to question. Listen. It’s going to be listeningfirst. “Thank you for trusting me with this. What can I do to help you? How can I supportyou? Can I help you find resources?”Do not ask who they were out with. There are things that, although well intentioned, comeacross as blaming. And also not trying to pull control away from them, because again ifyou’ve been a victim of violence, that’s one of the things people talk about, is “I had nocontrol.” So really, you say the words and it doesn’t sound like much, but when you’re inthat experience, it’s really terrible, so the last thing that person needs – unless they say it –is for you to go like, “We are going to do A, B, and C,” because you have now taken controlaway from them again. So I think being sensitive about that, and at least my experience is alot of just listening. People want to share and they want to get it out and process it, solistening and being supportive is key. And then, want resources? Let’s go find some.Alie: That’s great advice. Maybe ice cream.Callie: Yeah, ice cream is never a bad idea. laughs]Alie: Aki wants to know: Is there any truth to victims of abuse as children seeking similar abuseas adults? And Tyler and Rebecca Stefulj both ask: Why do people in abusive relationshipsoften struggle to end the relationship, and people who essentially have been abused at onepoint in their life continuing to be abused or not being able to leave or feeling like they canleave?Callie: I see that as, kind of, two different things. There is some evidence of people who maybe hadbeen abused as children end up in relationships where they’re being abused, and again, I’mgoing to leave that to psychologists. But there’s a little bit of ‘what we’re familiar with’,right? When you’re a child in a household and you’re being abused, sometimes kids don’teven know that that’s wrong. That’s just what it is. That’s normal. And so that’s comfortableand normal, and then, it sounds kinda strange, and then they find a relationship that’scomfortable and normal. And then maybe they realize differently.I did some work with Kristin Carbone-Lopez, who was at the University of Missouri-St.Louis (she’s since moved on), and we were looking at the movement from abusiverelationship, to non-abusive relationship, to no relationship, and we found evidence of a lotof people who were in abusive relationships did move to no relationships, so it doeshappen.Why doesn’t it happen all the time? It’s a resource structural issue. A few things: Say I am ina bad relationship, and I’m being abused, and there’s a shelter down the street, but youknow what, the shelter doesn’t take pets. There’s no way I’m leaving my pets behind. Orthey don’t take male children. Or “He’s going to know where I am.” Or, “If I miss one more 23day at work, I’m going to lose my job.” There are a lot of things like that. Or he’s kept… andI’m using he/she because I’m using myself as an example; this does go both ways. But ifthey have all the control of the money and you have nothing, and they don’t give you a cellphone, it’s not as easy as it seems.Another thing that I think victims, survivors, recognize is that that period between leavingand getting free is the time most people are killed. Watching a true crime show, forexample, you see a woman who ends up murdered and in the beginning, I’m like, “Herhusband did it,” and everyone’s like, “How did you know?” I’m like, “Because that’s usuallywho did it.” And that’s why. So it isn’t just so easy as like, “I’m fed up, I’m getting in my carand driving away and starting over.”Any of us, I would challenge any of us to say, I want you to go today, gather what’s mostimportant to you today, and leave and start a new life. Now do that when you’ve gotsomebody who might kill you for doing that. It’s just not easy. So, advocates are so greatand more and more shelters are available, and we’re learning about the need to be able totake pets or children, and jobs, but it’s still incredibly hard. I think it’s almost like howanybody got out is pretty awesome. It’s amazing. But I just can’t even imagine what it takes.But I hope people try if they feel it’s the right thing to do and it’s a safe thing to do. But it’snot easy.Alie: I’ll look up some resources for that, too, and put them in.Aside: I found a great article on a site about, of all things, frugality, calledFemmeFrugality.com, and they wrote up a great list. For example: If you call 211, it willconnect you with a local chapter of a United Way and often they have special services forthose who are going through domestic violence. They might even have special fundsspecifically to help victims get out. The site also recommended Soroptimist. That can helpwith job training, and may also have financial grants. The National Coalition AgainstDomestic Violence can offer basic financial education. If you’re just needing to establishindependence, you aren’t sure where to start on your own, the National Domestic ViolenceHotline is there to chat about everything from finances to an actual exit plan, and I’ll put alink to this post from FemmeFrugality.com up at AlieWard.com/Ologies/Victimology.There’ll be a link to that in the show notes.And encouragingly, nearly 20% of intimate partner violence survivors did receiveassistance from a victim service agency, so help is out there.Alie: Heather Hutchison asks: I live in Parkland, Florida, and although my kids had alreadygraduated from MSD, I know that they were deeply affected by the recent shooting there, aswas I and a lot of the community. How can you cope with the effects of something you werenot directly involved with?Callie: That’s a really great question. I’m going to answer it in kind of a weird way, and I’m goingto go back to the media here. The media has done, I think, a big disservice to the public interms of school violence. Research is clear: schools are safer than non-schools. Kids are farless likely to be victimized at a school than away from a school. Same with colleges. We talkabout campus violence all the time. It’s not campus violence we’re talking about, we’retalking about violence against college students that happens predominantly off-campus.And I think sloppy use of words and highlighting these really rare, although terrible,terrible events, has led to people being really afraid of colleges and schools. And I give talkson college student victimization, I always have somebody come to me and say, “We’re not 24sending our daughter to college anymore because it’s not safe. We’re going to keep herhere at home.” And to me, that’s the worst outcome ever. I’ve written several pieces, andthey’re in journals, and I know people don’t read journals and stuff, but I’m trying to get itout there a little bit more, for people to understand the true risks.Again, can you ever be totally risk-free? No. But I’m telling you that risk of victimization isfar less at school, whether at the college level or K through 12. It’s scary to think that it’s soclose to home. It’s scary to think it could have been your child that’s killed. I don’t knowthat we can take that away, though.Alie: But also the media does do a bit of a good job of making us –Callie: Afraid!Alie: – feel that things are scary and that there’s danger everywhere.Callie: Right. As I try to tell my students, the media – and again, I love the media in many ways –but there are certain things. They have a job. Their job is to deliver viewers to advertisers.And how do you do that? You do that by keeping them coming back. And how do you keepcoming back? Scary stuff. And I’m not saying that I’m not prone to it. Oh my gosh. Iremember one time I went on a trip and, again, I don’t have a TV at my house and so I wasso excited in the hotel room, and I turned on the television and I’m watching the WeatherChannel, how pathetic. clip from 22 Jump Street: Jonah Hill, “Do you like… weather?”]And I’m watching it and it’s like, “Oh my gosh, it’s like Armageddon back home, my god!” SoI get on the phone and I call back home and I’m like, “Is it okay there? Because it reallylooks like it’s just all coming apart.” And they’re like, “Yeah, it’s totally fine.” I’m like, damnit! They got me! And it did. I continued to go back just to make sure things were fine, andthat’s what it’s about. It’s not about educating us generally – this podcast being theexception. laughs] “Well, I try.”]Callie: But it’s about returning viewers to advertisers and that’s a way we know is effective.Alie: Keep ‘em scared.Callie: Yep.Alie: Claire Biddiscombe, Emily Fiori, and Kayla Pugh asked: Is there a better, moreencompassing term for survivor? What are your thoughts on the use of the term survivorinstead of victim?We touched on that. I mean, there are victims who do not survive. For those that do, isthere a preferred terminology?Callie: I see it differently. I see some people who say, “I am a victim. Do not call me a survivor.”And I see people who are like, “I am a survivor, do not call me a victim,” and they find beingcalled a victim is disempowering. They survived. As a victimologist, if I’m talking about myresearch, I deal with people who are murdered and not murdered, and I tend to use theword victim. So again, I try to be sensitive, depending on if I’m talking to a particularperson, to use the term that they prefer, but I mean no disrespect if I say victim versussurvivor. But yeah, there’s no agreement in the field about it, although I would say there’smore use of survivor than not.Alie: Kay had a great question: How are victims who don’t trust the system to help them – likegender-based violence, survivors, people of color, undocumented folks – expected to heal?So what do you recommend for, maybe, victims who don’t trust the system to help them?25Callie: I’m not sure that the system is good for healing most anybody. Maybe seeing as good ofjustice as can come from it, possibly? But I think for getting healing, you’ve got to useanother system, and it’s going to be counseling, or psychology, or volunteering, orwhatever in your specific situation is good for you, which feeds your soul and helps to healyou. But, man, I don’t see the criminal justice system as a place to go to get healed, sadly.Can they point you to resources? Yeah, they can do that, too. And then the CJ system now,generally, you should have access to a victim advocate if you’re navigating the system, butit doesn’t make it easy. It’s still hard. It’s still really challenging.Alie: So it’s like two different things, like going to a tire shop for a sandwich.Callie: That’s how I kinda see it, right? Yeah.Alie: Okay. That’s good to know.And Katie Chavez and Keith T both had questions about either being trained to become apolice officer or being a correctional officer, and they say: As a correctional officer, people Isupervise often use their victimization to justify their crimes and minimize their offenses.How can I invoke empathy from them about their victims?Callie: That’s a really tough one. I’ve been in some discussions this last year about the differencein terms like rape and sexual assault, and one of the reasons I’m very passionate aboutusing the word rape when we’re talking about a penetration – any orifice, any object,without consent – is for a few reasons. One, to call that sexual assault for many victims,survivors, it minimizes it, because when you say sexual assault to a lot of people, theyenvision a butt grab, which is a sexual assault, but that’s very different than a rape.I want to use the word ‘rape’ because it acknowledges the actual violence that occurred tothat victim, but it also forces the offender to not be able to hide behind, “I only sexuallyassaulted her,” which is heard a lot. It kind of goes to this point that offenders need tounderstand the damage they did to another human, an autonomous human being that theyhurt, and that can be very hard. There’s groups out there that work with offenders, or, say,sexual offenders who are trying to go through a re-entry, and that’s a part of the goal, is tomake them acknowledge it.Aside: Callie says that just booting an offender off-campus or incarcerating someonelikely won’t solve the problem. They may go on to do it again, just to different people. Andthis is why therapy for violent individuals benefits more than just the offender.Callie: Punishment has its place, but making sure they don’t go do that again is far moreimportant, and this goes back to our prison discussion earlier. Throwing people in prisonconstantly is A) a taxpayer drain, it pulls away from education and other important socialservices, and… I mean, punishing isn’t enough. Teaching people to do differently and givingthem the ability to do differently is far more important. Our country’s not there yet. We liketo punish. We still do.Aside: Let’s lighten things up with a very stupid question.Alie: I always ask this one, too: Are there any movies or any TV shows with victimologists thatyou’re like, “You do a good job,” or you’re like, “That. Is. Ridiculous. That’s not how itworks”?Callie: Since I don’t have a TV, I don’t see. I think all of the things on the TV shows, they createthese positions that don’t exist. I mean, we see students who come all the time going, “I 26wanna be a CSI investigator!” Well, nobody is going to crime scenes, then going into the lab,and looking in micro… you know, nobody is doing all that, that’s many, many roles. So Ithink, overall, they’re pretty unrealistic. But I will also throw in the caveat that since I don’thave a TV, I don’t know a lot about what’s going on anymore. laughs]Alie: There needs to be a new show that’s just about victimology, that just deals with victims’stories.And what’s the hardest thing about your job? What just sucks the most, what’s difficult,what’s hard to work through?Callie: The hardest thing, honestly, is not enough time. There’s just not enough time. I hadsomebody who met me for coffee yesterday because they want me to help on a reallyimportant project and I said yes, of course, and then I’m overcommitted, and I’m so busy,and that’s the hardest part of it.So I’m like dead serious when I’m saying that I hope people out there are listening, thinkingabout, “What do I want to do with my life? I want to make a difference.” Go out there,become a criminologist, victimologist, and help us. We need so many more people, sopeople like me aren’t trying to do it all. Because I can’t. I can’t do it all. And all the othervictimologists out there, I think, are equally really just working like crazy, because we careand we want to see change. And it can happen, but we need more of us. Time, if you cangive me time, that would be great. laughs]Aside: If anyone has discovered a quantum wormhole that allows us to have more timein a day, just please do holler.Alie: What’s your favorite thing about your job? What’s the most rewarding, most fulfilling?What keeps you going?Callie: I love research because it really is an adventure. Research done right is asking a question,gathering data, and answering it. This notion that research is having an answer and tryingto find data to support it, that’s not research. That is not a researcher and that’s notresearch. But I love to ask a question and then answer it with the best data I can find,because the answer often is surprising, and the answer always raises other questions. Andit’s so cool.To me, I actually envision it’s like seeing a bunch of trees and heading into these treeswithout a path, and wondering where it takes you, and it always takes you somewhere, andit’s like, “Wow, this is so cool.” And research is that way to me. I like that. And I also like thefact that if I am like, “Oh, I want to focus on such-and-such now,” I can do that. I mean, isthere a better job than that? laughs]Alie: Just getting to be curious, ask questions, find the answer, and then help people along theway.Callie: Absolutely.Alie: What a job. I love this call to action, that if you’re interested in this, start looking intovictimology as a career.Callie: Absolutely. I mean, I so, so, so, so mean it. And it’s something anybody can do. Have somecuriosity. I do statistics, some people are like, “Oh my god, that’s so scary.” Come take mystatistics course, it is not scary. It’s not scary. You’re doing this already, you’re just notusing the language we use. And I do love to teach stats – that’s like the super-nerd that I am 27– and I teach it really well, because it’s not about math, it’s about language and it’s aboutanswering questions, and here’s the tools to do it. And many of my students are placed inanalyst positions around, some in other cities. I love that. And they all come in, some ofthem crying, even before the semester begins because they’re so stressed, and they end upgoing like, “Wow, I can do this and I love it.” Every single person’s capable of it. And weneed you!Alie: Thank you so much for being on.Callie: Well, thanks for asking, this was super fun.it’s the lady in front of you at the checkout with 26 items, who doesn’t realize she’s in theexpress lane, and is fully oblivious to your glares, Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies.So, congrats for not skipping this one. You did it. If it’s on auto-play and you’re like, “NOOoOooOoO,don’t play the scorpion one.” It’s too late, bitch. It’s playing. You’re in this now. Don’t press stop.Don’t! This one is amazing. I promise there are facts in this episode that you will drop inconversation and it will make you un-fucking-forgettable.Okay, first, really quick, thank you patrons for making this show possible via Patreon.com/Ologies.For as little as a dollar a month, you can submit questions to the ologists. And buckle the hell up,because I’m about to record like 10 episodes in the next few weeks. There are so many questionsyou can submit, so hop on board. Thank you to everyone in Ologies merch, available atAlieWard.com and for tagging #OlogiesMerch so I can repost it on Mondays.Also, thanks to everyone who makes sure that they are subscribed and leaves a rating and a review.You know I read them, and I pick a fresh one each week. This one, Erica Paddopof [phonetic] says:I’ve always loved science and learning about the crazy world we live in, but I bought into theidea that scientists were all super brainy people in lab coats who preferred sterile labs todealing with normal people. Where did I get that idea from?! Not only do I love all of theOlogies subjects, but each ologist is so gosh darn down to earth, and knowledgeable, andexcited, and someone I would love to nerd out with over a beer. This podcast fills the role of theScholastic Book Fair from my nerdy elementary school days.Erica Paddopof, thank you for reminding me of the soft cover paradise that was the Scholastic BookFair.Okay, scorpiology. Hell to the yes. This is a real ology. It’s a subset of arachnology, arachnids.‘Scorpion’ comes from the Greek - are you ready for this? - for scorpion! Okay, that is not somethingthat made me say, “Oh my god.”This ologist, I met under very, very weird circumstances. Two years ago, in a dusty field, in themiddle of nowhere, at a festival for Burning Man-types, where we were both speaking on a panelabout science. We were a little wide-eyed and just kind of sussing things out. I dug her immediately,I wanted her on for so long.Scheduling was difficult, but she was in LA for a 500 Queer Scientists conference and to accept the2019 Walt Westman Award for her support that she provides LGBTQ people in STEM. This is wherewe’re going to throw in some airhorns. I think we need some airhorns for that. [DJ airhorns to anEDM rave beat]Now, I went to her hotel, just giddily, and I asked her one million questions. We covered: mythsabout scorpions; what big pinchers mean; movie magic; how lethal are these critters; where is theirbutt?; do they make out with each other?; parables about scorpions; glow-in-the-dark magic;getting stung; and also why hiding under a rock is beneficial for some insects but can be verydifficult for people, emotionally. So bust out your blacklight, keep your ears on alert, for STEMadvocate, science communicator, researcher, expedition leader, and curator at the CaliforniaAcademy of Sciences, Scorpiologist, Dr. Lauren Esposito.2----------Alie Ward: Okay, so you are… I looked this up. You’re an arachnologist, but I saw thatthere is a subset, that is scorpiology.Dr. Lauren Esposito: There is.Alie: [high pitched squeal]Lauren: I’m, technically-speaking, a scorpiologist. But I’ve been trying to broaden my horizons andbe an arachnologist and study more kinds of arachnids aside from scorpions. So, I’m abudding arachnologist, let’s say, and an accomplished scorpiologist.Alie: Your business card should say, ‘Accomplished Scorpiologist’. Now I met you a couple yearsago, in the deserts, at a festival, a Symbiosis Festival.Lauren: Yeah, I was, like, shellshocked, I think, when I met you. I was like, “I don’t know what’sgoing on. There’s so many people and I’m pretty sure they’re all high on drugs.”Alie: [laughs] There were so few pants and shirts worn.Lauren: I remember, in the middle… Was it the middle of our panel? I gave another little talk so Ican’t remember which one it was, but a fully-naked guy just walked into the tent, and hewas so high, and he just walked up to the front of the stage and was standing theremesmerized, fully-naked. [clip of a hippie meditation circle]Alie: It was one of the stranger places that we’ve communicated science.Lauren: But it’s good right? You gotta get it in there whenever you can.Alie: If you’ve got a captive audience, talk to them about scorpions! I remember meeting youand you told me you were a scorpion expert, and I was like, “How many scorpion expertsare there?” And you were like, “Not many.” And I have bragged about you so many times,where I have said, “I met a scorpion expert! There’s like 10 in the world!” How manypeople study scorpions with the depth that you do?Lauren: There’s definitely not many of us. And I would say, like, people who have a PhD inscorpions? A dozen at most.Alie: Oh my god! Are you ever in the same room?Lauren: Hmm, rarely. Scorpion biologists are kind of like scorpions, not really particularly keen onmeeting each other. Slightly combative, but incredibly intelligent and persistent. I mean,present company included, I guess.Alie: What drew you to scorpions?Lauren: This is such a complicated question. Like, nothing really. It was kind of like serendipity. Igrew up in the desert southwest, so I saw scorpions certainly as a kid, but I wasn’tparticularly intrigued or wanting to dedicate my life to the study of these animals. But Iwas super into nature. And I loved turning over all the pavers in my mom’s garden andlooking for cockroaches, and earwigs, and stuff. Which she didn’t love, and especiallydidn’t love when I brought them inside alive. But my mom’s a biologist and eventually shetaught me to make a killing jar so instead of bringing her live cockroaches, I would bringher euthanized cockroaches.Alie: What is a killing jar? Is it just a cotton ball with ethanol?Lauren: Cotton ball with fingernail polish remover in an old peanut butter jar.3Alie: Oh my god. A killing jar sounds so much more…Lauren: Grotesque and morbid.Alie: Yeah!Lauren: Like, “Here, take this killing jar, daughter, and take it out into the garden.” But it’seuthanasia, it’s a humane way of quickly euthanizing insects. So, my mom taught me howto make one of these and I would collect insects from the garden and make an insectcollection in old egg cartons.Alie: Cool!Lauren: But then I grew up and forgot that I liked that stuff because I was a teenager and wasmostly into doing what teenagers do.Alie: [jokingly] Causing trouble? Causing raucous?Lauren: Yeah, like rabble rousing.Alie: Getting on people’s lawns, turning up the music too loud?Lauren: Yeah, like toilet papering and those kinds of things. [laughs] And then halfway throughcollege, I took an entomology class, and was like, “Oh my god, I love this.” And then Iapplied for a summer internship at the American Museum of Natural History, not knowingthat it was going to be an internship studying scorpions. Which it was. And I got it, and Ishowed up, and they dumped me into the lap of a new curator at the American Museum,Lorenzo Prendini, who would later become my PhD advisor.Aside: So, she and this new curator spent the summer figuring out a research system, andthen for newbie, Lauren, the New York City subway system probably. When the internshipwas over, she realized she loved science, but she didn’t want to go into medical school likeshe thought. She’d rather be outdoors and studying nature. So she thought, “Graduateschool!” So she contacted her curator from the internship and he said, “Yo, come back! Getyour PhD working with me and these fricken scorps! So sick!” And she was like, “Toight!” Ithink that was the convo.Lauren: Move to New York and do a PhD? Absolutely, I’ll do that!Alie: Are there even scorpions in New York?Lauren: There are no scorpions in New York.Alie: I didn’t think so.Lauren: None at all. There’s a museum full of probably the world’s greatest collection of scorpions,but certainly no living scorpions. But the good news is you can hop on a plane from NewYork to just about anywhere in the world relatively quickly, and I did. It was scorpions ordie.Alie: I feel like scorpions do have a high-stakes reputation, pretty much like that.Lauren: I think scorpions, even more so than spiders, everyone’s like, “They’re definitely going tokill you. Any encounter will be lethal for you. For sure.”Alie: Yeah, if you see a scorpion from six feet away, [humorous hyperbole] you will drop deadlater that day, even if you have no contact.4Lauren: [picking up the joke] It’s gonna jump across the room and go flying. Wings are gonna comeout of its body and it will try to kill you no matter what. [“They are ruthless, secretive, andhighly organized.”]Aside: They are not. We will address this later.Alie: Now, at what point when you were studying them did you say, “Holy shit these are cool!”?Lauren: You know it started when I was doing that undergraduate internship and I realized, like,“Man, scorpions are amazing for so many reasons.”Aside: Hooooooo boy howdy. Get ready for this. Oh hot damn. Here we go. Here we go.Lauren: One: They were the first terrestrial arthropod predators. So, before anything else was onland, scorpions came on land, these little beasts. They weren’t little then; the ancestors ofscorpions were like a meter long. They were huge.Alie: Three feet?!Lauren: Three feet. Yeah, maybe even bigger, maybe five in some cases.Alie: Holy shit! What? That’s crazy!Lauren: And they were these underwater marine predators and they were, like, ruling the oceansat the time. And some people have hypothesized that because we found these ancienttrackways alongside rivers, of scorpions… their little footprints embedded in rock… well, itwas mud that turned into rock over time. They’ve hypothesized that they actually becameamphibious and were coming up on the land to eat spawning fish. Like grizzlies, you knowhow grizzlies come in the river to eat the spawning fish? They were doing the same thing,but they were like the size of grizzlies, but they were scorpion ancestors. [ominous voice:“When it comes to scorpions, the bigger the better!”]Alie: Oh my god. I’m literally having vertigo. I can’t… Just imagining a scorpion the size of akiddie pool. Like an alligator!Lauren: Basically like an alligator, they were called eurypterids, ancestors of scorpions. Andeventually the gills that they had to breathe underwater were internalized and thatallowed them to live on land. So the scorpions of today, they basically look identical to thescorpions of 450 million years ago. They’ve been on Earth forever, so we can ask all kindsof questions about what happened on Earth in the last 450 million years by trying tounderstand the evolutionary history of scorpions.Alie: And so how do you think they got littler and littler?Lauren: The main driving factor behind why insects and arachnids are not as big as they used tobe, as big as the fossils we find, is because the oxygen percentage in the air, in theatmosphere. Because scorpions, and spiders, and insects, all basically passively respire.They don’t have lungs where they’re breathing in and out. And they don’t have closedcirculatory systems, they just have blood that gets pumped around by a heart that’s openin their body. And so the rate at which oxygen can get to all their tissues that they need forwalking around, and moving, and eating, and doing all of the things, is limited by howmuch the concentration of oxygen there is in the air. And over time, the oxygenconcentration has gone down.Aside: So, Lauren explained that when life started coming on land and there were moreand more air-breathing critters, the carbon dioxide output increased and the oxygen levelswent down. So, when you have less fuel, you downsize. So, think of trading in a Hummer 5for a Fiat, but slowly, as a result of evolution and all of your relatives dying off before you.Okay, so apart from the last 450 million years of history, where can we find scorpions?Alie: So where do scorpions live? Clearly not in New York City.Lauren: They live basically everywhere that there’s not major freezes for long parts of the year. Soimagine a place [“Scorpions, in your underwear.”] and there are probably scorpions there.They’re not in Antarctica because there’s really nothing aside from penguins, and things inthe ocean, and bacteria. They’re also not in the Arctic because it’s cold and there's snow onthe ground all year round. But they are in places like the Alps; you wouldn’t expect them inthe alps. Or the upper reaches of the Andes like in Argentina, there are scorpions.My real area of specialty is the neo-tropics, so I go to the Caribbean, Central America,South America. But I’ve been to places like islands off the coast of equatorial Africa,southeast Asia. I don’t know, I’ve been all over the world looking for those little buggers.At the point when I decided to do a PhD, I think that was part of the intrigue for me. Thepotential to travel the world doing science, incorporating two things that I love, which istraveling and science.But you know what’s kind of funny, is that recently I remembered this thing that happenedto me when I was a kid. It was in the 6th grade, and I had a homeroom teacher who gaveus this assignment. The assignment was to write an essay about what you want to dowhen you grew up. Pretty straightforward, right? I feel that happens all the time in school.But I was so upset about it because I didn’t know what I wanted to be.I remember crying at home over this assignment because it was so frustrating for me that Ihad to write and know at this age of 11 what I should do when I grow up. I knew lots ofthings that I didn’t want to do, but I didn’t know what I did want to do. And eventually, Isettled on… I wasn’t sure, but I knew I either wanted to be a rocket scientist or a hobo. AndI mean hobo in the sense of train traveling, seeing-the-world hobo.Alie: [laughs] Yeah! Just freewheelin’.Aside: Quick aside to learn ya on some hobo facts, cool? Cool. The word hobo is ofunknown origin, but it may be from homeward bound, or it may be from homeless boy, orfrom hoe-boy, meaning a farmhand who would travel, riding the rails, looking for jobs. CanI just tell you a little more about hobos? Okay, great.They had specialized lingo, such as for example: to ‘flip’ meant to board a moving train; amulligan is a type of community stew created by several hobos combining whatever foodthey had into one big pot; a jungle was a big hobo camp; and to ‘catch the westbound’meant to die.Is that not poetry? Catching the westbound. Also, they made a code of conduct for hobos atthe National Hobo Convention in 1889 and the code of conduct is legit. Starting with:1. Decide your own life. Don’t let another person run or rule you.2. When in town, always respect the local law and officials. Try to be a gentleman at alltimes. (Sexist, but a good rule.)3. Don’t take advantage of someone who is in a vulnerable situation; locals, or otherhobos.4. Always try to find work even if temporary. And always seek out jobs nobody wants.6They also had codes of conduct to stay clean and report anyone who harms children. Weshould all be as decent as hobos. Also, they had these symbols they would leave to guideother hobos. This led me to a webpage for the National Cryptologic Museum in Maryland,which yes, I now have to do a cryptology episode so bad. So, in closing, hobos are clean,kindly, respectful folks who travel for work and see the land. So for Lauren, it was eitherthat or be a rocket scientist.Lauren: I feel like I hit that intersection. I’m doing science. I’m using technological tools likegenetics and genomics and at the same time traveling the world. I’m like exactly at themiddle of rocket scientist and hobo. Nailed it!Alie: So, tell me a little bit about the basic structure of a scorpion. What are we dealing with?Because I feel like they’ve got crab in the front, snake face in the back with the venom.Lauren: They’ve got the business in the back. It’s like a mullet, right? Scorpions, like all arachnids,have two primary body parts. They have the prosoma which is the head, and opisthosomawhich is the body. So, picture a spider, they have two main chunks. But scorpions have alittle extra business, which is the tail. And the prosoma and the opisthosoma are kind offused, so there’s not a real delineation between the head and the body.Then up in the front they have two pairs of appendages. They have chelicerae, which arethe mouth parts, like the chewing mouthparts they use to basically to rip up meats [Frenchaccent: “It is raw meat.”] before they get it down their gullet. And then they have claws thatthey use mostly for grabbing onto prey. In some scorpions they just use the claws to grabtheir prey. They don’t ever actually need to sting them because they have these big chunkyclaws. Picture the big black Emperor scorpions you see in the movies all the time. Theyhave these huge claws up front, and they almost never use their tail, and their venom’s notvery toxic.But other scorpions have these really slender, thin claws and they really just use those formanipulating prey items, and mostly use the tail and really powerful super toxic venomfor disabling their prey and escaping their predators. [Joker from Batman: “Stabby,stabby!”]Claws in the front, tail in the back, and at the very end of the tail is the stinger. The stingerlooks like a bulb, like a lightbulb, and at the end of that is a hypodermic needle. Inside ofthe bulb is a layer of secretory cells, cells that secrete toxins, surrounded by muscle thatallows them to squeeze those toxins out of the cells and into the hypodermic needle thatthey use to inject into their prey.Aside: So, their venom bulb is kind of like those squirty things you would jam into yourear hole to flush out funky chunks, only it’s a nerve toxin, made by DNA that they probablyhad for something else but evolved it to become venom. So, what is in this exactly?Lauren: So, the really crazy thing is that their venom is not just one thing. It’s actually a complexcocktail of all sorts of different components. They have things like antimicrobials in there,enzymes that break open tissue and help them digest. And they also have these complexneuropeptides. Neuropeptides are basically things that when they interact with yournervous system, they tell your nerves to either send a signal when they’re not supposed tobe sending a signal or they inhibit the transmission of signals between cells.Aside: Neuropeptides, by-the-by, are chains of amino acids that form these protein-likemolecules that your nervous system uses to communicate. The neuropeptides bind toreceptors and activate a bunch of events inside a neuron. The neuropeptides in venom can 7jack that system by cutting off the neurons from talking to each other or sending signalswhen they shouldn’t be talking. So, venom is like when someone grabs your phone andstarts DMing people it shouldn’t. Or withholding a text from your boss. Okay, what ifyou’re a cricket and you don’t have a boss or a phone?Alie: Oooh, what does it do if you’re prey?Lauren: If you’re prey, what it might do is disable you, keep you from moving, send you into aseizure, really just incapacitate you very quickly so you can be eaten and make babyscorpions with the energy you get from your prey. But if you’re a predator, what it does issends pain signals to your brain, telling your brain that you’re on fire [man screaming: “Ohmy god! We’re having a fire… sale.”] when you’re really not. And that pause, that signalinterruption, caused by the scorpion venom allows the scorpions a moment to escapewhile the predator is reacting to the signal that it’s forcing its body to send itself.Alie: What types of scorpions have venom that is powerful enough to, say, incapacitate a dog ora human? How much do they get a bad rap?Lauren: Yeah, well they get a bad rap overall. So far we’ve discovered about 2,500 species ofscorpions give or take, and about 25 of those are a concern for a healthy human. And youknow, there’s maybe a dozen or two more that are a concern for people that have acompromised immune system, or are elderly, or very young. The majority of scorpions…Less than 10% of all scorpions are something really dangerous that we need to be worriedabout. That being said, all scorpions do have a stinger and they can jab it into your body.And they can inject things that are in their venom, but oftentimes those things are moremild than a bee sting or a wasp sting.Alie: Oh, okay! What happens if you do get stung by a scorpion? Has that ever happened to you?Lauren: It happened one time. For a long time, I got to say no. I’m a professional, I takeprecautions.Alie: [teases] Suit of armor.Lauren: But, like a year ago now, almost exactly one year ago, I was at this event and I was passingscorpions around that I had found in the forest to little children for them to hold. [Alie: “Asone does…”] And I was passing a scorpion from one child to another and it got grumpy, likeI think it had had too many grubby kid hands on it, and it stung me. And I was almostconfused when it was stinging me. I was like, “What are you doing?!” Because I’d handledthese kinds of scorpions many, many times. It’s a scorpion called the Pacific Forestscorpion. We have them all throughout the Bay Area and northward.And I was like, “What are you doing? What is happening? This is not normal!” Then myfinger kind of throbbed for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and it felt like if I had jammed athumbtack in my finger. Like if you jam a thumbtack into your finger, it would throb. Butthere were no long-term consequences.Let me step back and say there are two major groups of scorpions. There’s a group calledthe Buthid scorpions. It’s one of the oldest lineages of scorpions and it also has thegreatest number of species compared to all of the other lineages. And those ones all makeneurotoxins that affect mammals. So, they make neurotoxins that interact with ournervous system.8Aside: Again, these are the Buthids. I looked everywhere to see where the name Buthidcomes from and I think it’s from the Greek for ox or cow because their stings were thoughtto be real cow killers. Again, Buthids.Lauren: And so, all of those have a more painful sting, or the ones that are potentially lethal tohumans belong to that group, the Buthids. And all the other scorpions are non-Buthids, allthe other groups of scorpions. And all of those guys typically don’t make neurotoxins thataffect mammal nervous systems.Aside: Considering the reputation of scorpions, they do carry some dramatic names, likethe Black Spitting Thick Tailed Scorpion, or like the Man-Killer, or Deathstalker. Thesekind of sound like 1970s carnival rides. So bitchin’!PS, when I googled ‘scorpions with cool names’, I pulled up an article entitled, no joke,from a baby blog, “10 Fierce Baby Names for Your Scorpio.” Given that I’m a Scorpio, I hadto read it. And among the suggestions for your autumn infant, who will undoubtedly causedrama, are the names Crispin, Evening, Steel, and Nyx. Not unlike scorpion venom itself,this article caused some involuntary sweating and gagging.Lauren: But scientific names are dreamt up by the scientists that first recognized that species asbeing a new species.Alie: Have you gotten to name any?Lauren: I have, yeah!Alie: What?!Lauren: Yeah, we discover new scorpions all the time. There’s like maybe 50 or so added a year toour knowledge.Alie: How do you decide how to name them?Lauren: Well, different people have different approaches. And a name is really somethingconsidered something ‘in honor of’, so if you use a person or a thing, you’re naming it inhonor of that person or thing. Oftentimes people take the approach of naming it somethingthat describes its physical attributes, so the name has Latin words for slender, or pale, oryellow, or whatever. Other people use names that come from Indigenous languages wherethey’re found, which is one of the methods I like to use because I feel like it’s honoring theplace where the scorpion is from and integrating the Indigenous knowledge.Alie: That’s great! Ask me how many species I’ve discovered.Lauren: How many?Alie: None!Lauren: Oh, well we could fix that if you want.Alie: Can I come to the desert and turn over some rocks and be like, “Do we know this guyyet?!”Lauren: My favorite place is the tropical jungle, so you can come to the tropical jungle and do that.Alie: Oh my god, sign me up. Large luggage, put me in it. When you’re discovering scorpions, Iunderstand that there are blacklights involved.Lauren: There are, yeah.9Alie: Tell me everything about why they fluoresce under blacklights. Every time I see it I feellike I’m looking at a Bob Marley poster and I’m on drugs and in college. [stoner voice: “Thatis so trippy.”]Lauren: You might be. So, all scorpions fluoresce. It’s a trait universal to scorpions. Whatfluorescence means is that there’s a pigment in the exoskeleton of scorpions, it’sembedded in there. It’s called coumarin.Aside: Side note: coumarin is often found in plants, and according to this Wikipediaprose, “It has a sweet odor resembling the scent of newly mown hay.” It’s also found incassia cinnamon, in fake vanilla, and in perfumes. Oh, and it makes venomous arthropodsglow like ravers. Also PS, I never did drugs in college. I was a straight-edge goth with like 5jobs and a bunch of science lab homework. But my roommates owned a 6-foot bong, so Iobserved a lot of blacklight staring. Anyways, coumarin.Lauren: What it does is take in light waves, just from ambient light, and it excites those light wavesand it projects them back at a higher wavelength. That’s what causes the fluorescence. It’snot a reflection, it’s actually like an excitation of light beams. So, they all fluoresce thisbright, neon, toxic-sludge green under an ultraviolet light. We don’t really know why theyhave this feature.There’re a few possibilities. One, it’s just a byproduct of how their exoskeleton forms, likethe process in which they form their exoskeleton creates a fluorescence. Or, alternatively,it has a function that’s helpful for them. There’re a few possibilities. One thing that’s beenproposed is that it’s a whole-body light detection system, so it allows them to detect whenthere’s light. I think it could very well be, but also they have eyes, so typically they can seeif there’s light outside, or not. It could be another function as well.The other functions that have been thought up are that it’s a way to tell other animals thatthey’re dangerous. Like bees are black and yellow; black and yellow is a sign that they’redangerous. Scorpions are active at night, and at night colors don’t show up very well.Things that are active at night can’t see very well in color. Many things that are doingthings at night have evolved greater UV capabilities. Flowers that bloom at night have a UVpattern that attracts pollinators.So, scorpions that are active at night might want a UV pattern to say, “Hey wait! I’mdangerous and you should stay away from me.” Like a warning color. Or they’re actuallytrying to mimic something else like a flower and attract things so they can eat them. Sothose are all of the possibilities.Alie: Do you think that their ancient ancestors that were ginormous could fluoresce?Lauren: Well, a geologist mentioned there are some really well-preserved fossils that preservedcuticle and the cuticle fluoresces.Alie: Oh my god!Aside: So, side note: this is due to their glowing hyaline layer in their exoskeleton. Also,did you know that horseshoe crabs also glow under UV light? And so do proteins in humansaliva, sweat, urine, and semen, just in case you like checking hotels rooms for secretions.Alie: How many blacklight flashlights do you have?Lauren: You know what, I go through them like candy. I can’t even keep track of them 90% of thetime. But I do have 2 that are really nice ones that I spent a lot of money buying from a 10company that, like, crafts them. And those ones are my babies. I know where they are at alltimes.Alie: If someone wanted to go out and look for critters at night, do you think getting a blacklight and just checking things out?Lauren: Yeah, in some place they sell them at Home Depot and you can go on a scorpion hunt. Thetrick is to go out at night because, one, you can’t really see anything with a blacklightduring the day because the blacklight isn’t a bright wavelength of light so it gets washedout by daylight. And two, scorpions are nocturnal so they’re active at night, not during theday.Aside: And in case you’re looking for a blacklight bug hunt or a Guess That Splatter Game[squishy splat] in your hotel, you can get a UV flashlight for around $10. But then, I wasreally curious as to how much a really good one costs. I searched on Amazon the highest tolowest price. There’s one on there that's a 400-watt ultraviolet LED emitter, it’s $6,000!Then they jump down to a couple hundred.Also, at this point, we talked a little bit about zodiac signs for Scorpios. It’s like, “Okay, ifyou’re born in a certain time of the year, there’s a little connect-the-dots with some stars,it really could have been anything.” Sure, does the constellation look a little bit like ascorpion? Maybe. It also looks kind of like a Bissell steam cleaner. So, who knows. Insteadof a Scorpio, I could have just been a carpet cleaner.Alie: Now, what about scorpions in movies or pop culture? Is there any movie that really does agood job with scorpions or one that really gets your goat?Lauren: You know, the problem I have with movies and scorpions is that they’re always veryinaccurate. Like, why in every single movie does it have to be the emperor scorpion?Emperor scorpions are from tropical Africa. They most definitely do not live in deserts.There are definitely no black scorpions living in a white sandy desert. That doesn’t exist.They want to blend in with their environment, they’re not trying to stand out like black onwhite background. So, why? Why? I just don’t understand it. Can they consult with abiologist and figure out what the appropriate-colored species is for the place that they’reshooting?Alie: Are emperor scorpions easier to handle?Lauren: Yeah, they’re really common in the pet trade. And for that reason they are the onlyscorpions that’s considered threatened or endangered because they have been overharvested for the pet trade, because of all of those movies.Aside: Some researchers think that scorpion venom may have cancer-fighting propertiesor could be used to develop anti-inflammatory drugs. It’s reported that a gallon ofscorpion venom is worth - are you ready - 39 million dollars! $39,000,000!! A year or twoago, there was a get-rich-quick scheme that started to spread in the Middle East tocountries like Iran, and it was just promising a fortune to anyone who could poach, orraise, and milk scorpions of their venom. But it turned out to be a total bust. So, labs arenot interested in amateur venom milkers.What are they gonna do with all these scorpions now? I guess just release them, they’resaying. Or perhaps, sell them as food. Scorpions can be like eating tiny land lobsters. Butbefore you fasten a postage stamp-sized tiny plastic bib, Dr. Esposito says that most 11scorpions don’t even reach sexual maturity until the age of 5 or 6, so she gets a little sadthinking about crunching and munching them.Lauren: They can live to be 25.Alie: Yeah, lay off the scorpions.Lauren: Yeah, lay off of them. And the other crazy thing about scorpions that I was struck by whenI first learned about them, is that the moms give birth to live babies.Alie: That was my next question! I’ve seen a picture of scorpions that just have a backpack fullof baby scorpions. What is happening there??Lauren: The courtship starts by what we call a pas de deux. They actually dance. They do like aballroom dance. They're actually quite refined animals. So, the males approach the femalesand grab onto her hand, they face her and grab on to her hands. And they do this danceback and forth where he leads her back and forth. And he does this thing called cheliceralmassage, which means he touches her mouth parts with his mouth parts. It’s basically likescorpion kissing.Sometimes, in some species, the male will sting the female in a particular place on thebody. And we don’t know what they’re doing. They’re probably injecting some sort ofpheromone or some kind of slight, very mild sedative to keep them from getting eatenbecause usually they’re generally smaller. And if he does the dance well, she likes hismoves, she likes his ballroom dancing, then he’ll deposit this gelatinous stalk on theground. It’s like a thing made out of a jelly sort of material. [Paris Hilton: “That’s hot.”]And at the top of it he puts a little sperm packet, and he leads her over it, and she’ll pick itup with her genital opening. And she stores the sperm in this specialized structure in herbody and decides when she wants to inseminate herself and also with whose sperm.Alie: Does she have different pockets? Like, “This is Jules’s... This is Kevin’s…”?Lauren: It’s unclear how they differentiate once they’ve been inseminated, if they have a way toseparate the packets, or if the packets stay… That part is unclear. We don’t quite know.Alie: It’s her business!Lauren: But at the point when she does decide to inseminate herself she has this complexovariuterus system. In many species it looks almost like a figure eight, and there’s littlespaces within that ovariuterus, where the embryos start to develop. Once they reachparturition age, she gives birth.Aside: Gestation period you ask? 7-9 months! Similar to a human. Or up to 14 months foran emperor scorpion. Just think: they have eight ankles that could swell up, walkingaround pregnant. What troopers! Some female scorpions are just pregnant most of thetime. Just most of their life, kind of like my catholic grandma who had 11 children.Lauren: And little baby scorpions come out of her birth canal.Alie: Oh my god, is that vi-vi-paris?Lauren: Yeah, the viviparous. [vi-VIP-ah-rus]Alie: Oh, viviparous! Clearly a word that I read more than I say.Lauren: There’s viviparous and ovoviviparous which is where you internalize eggs and when theeggs hatch you give birth. But scorpions are fully viviparous, so they actually connect the 12same as humans. Their embryos are connected to the mom via a membrane, so they’rereceiving nutrition directly from her. And they come out and they’re kind of in, like, anamniotic sac, sort of, and it’s clear, and once they give birth the babies break the sac andclimb up onto her arms.While she’s giving birth, she does this thing called a birth basket, where she arches herback up… because the opening is on their stomach. She arches her back up and makes herarms into a circle, like touches her hands together and makes a circle. So the babies willcrawl up her hands onto her back and they’ll stay up there… depends on the species, butthey’ll stay up there until they’ve molted for the first time; when they’ve shed theirexoskeleton and gotten a little bigger. And in that first period, they almost look a littlelarval still, like they don’t look like a normal scorpion. But as soon as they have that firstmolt, they look just like a tiny miniature scorpion.Aside: Did I just watch several macro-videos of baby scorpions being squeezed out of ascorpion vagina while sipping my morning coffee? I sure did. It looked like if you were tosqueeze unpeeled shrimp through a drinking straw. Just one after the other. Like comingthrough a water slide. Like bloop, bloop, “Ahhhhh!” Then they just climb up on the backand they live there like people on the deck of a yacht until they molt.Alie: So, they just hop off and be like, “Too-da-loo!”?Lauren: Yeah, they’ll kind of start coming off her back and getting back on for a little bit. At somepoint she hasn’t eaten in months and months and she’s hungry so she’ll just eat those littlesuckers if they don’t leave her alone.Alie: Oh my god!!Lauren: But in some species they do live semi-cooperatively. Like, they’re still living together in thesame area for a long period of time. The mom will live in a burrow with the babies, I don’tknow, like months, years maybe? And they’ll just live around each other and they tolerateeach other really well.And she gives birth anywhere from two to… I think the upper limit that anybody has everrecorded is like 140, like high 140. Let’s say 150, to call it even.Aside: [in a faraway and bewildered voice] 150 babies!!Lauren: That would be like a lot, and they all pile up on her back in a big giant pile.Alie: What a party!Lauren: Yeah, a scorpion party.Alie: Have you ever seen one in the wild that’s covered in tiny bebes?Lauren: Yeah, to find scorpions, I go out during the day and flip over rocks, and logs, and thingsthey like to hide under, and oftentimes I’ll flip over a rock or a log and there will be a momwith babies under there, in the right season like spring.Alie: Is it always a special treat to see one?Lauren: Yeah, and you know, I collect scorpions and euthanize them in order to study them. Ialways leave the moms. I don’t wanna take those moms and all those little babies. There’sno need for that.Alie: Is it hard to collect them and euthanize them for research? Or do you feel like the more welearn about them the more we can, kind of, conserve them as a species?13Lauren: Yeah. I mean, certainly for me that’s the rationalization. For most scorpions, we don’tknow basic natural history information; how long they live, how many babies they have,how they mate, what they eat, what eats them. We don’t know any of that informationexcept for like half a dozen species.Aside: So we have the lowdown on only six out of around 2,500 species. Futurescorpiologists: the world is your oyster, which is actually a mollusk, so I guess the world isyour arthropod. [ba-dum-TSH!]Lauren: The more information we know, the better we can protect them. And the truth is they’rereally environmentally sensitive. Most scorpion species, as soon as an environment getsdisturbed by humans, can’t survive there anymore. [“There goes the neighborhood”] Sothey’re good indicators of the relative health of an ecosystem.But yeah, I’ll say that I didn’t get into the business of studying scorpions because I lovekilling them. Unfortunately, they’re not that cooperative sitting under a microscope alive,and the only way to identify species and study things like venom or reproduction is to lookat them under the microscope.Alie: I think all entomologists have to.Lauren: It’s definitely a struggle.Alie: You can’t exactly look at them through binoculars and observe them for 10 hours likewolves or something.Lauren: Yeah. And unfortunately, with most invertebrates, we’re nowhere close we are withvertebrates in terms of knowing how many species are out there and what they’re doing.Maybe once we get there, we can switch to the binocular model. We would need somereally strong binoculars.Alie: Now, what is some flimflam about scorpions that you would like to debunk? What aresome myths that you’re like, “Let’s get the record straight, people!”Lauren: Well, here’s a few things you need to know about scorpions. 1. They can’t jump.Alie: Oh!! Okay.Lauren: It’s just a thing. They don’t jump. They can’t walk… They can walk on some verticalsurfaces that are grainy, like a rock that has little micro-areas to step on, but otherwisesomething that’s slick like windows, they could never walk on a window. So, they’re goingto have a hard time getting to you. If you see it three feet away, you don’t have to runaway, it’s not going to be able to grab you.Aside: With the exception of Arizona some parts of southern Nevada, and some parts ofwestern New Mexico, Lauren says:Lauren: In the US, there are no scorpions that you have to be concerned about.Alie: Oh, okay!Lauren: Worst case scenario, it feels like a wasp. Even those ones in Arizona, if you’re a healthyadult, you don’t have to worry. It’s not gonna kill you, it will just hurt for a little bit. It’ll feelmore like an electric shock than a wasp sting. But if you’re a child, you want to be safe andnot be playing with scorpions in Arizona as a rule of thumb. So that’s a thing.Alie: You have a lot of cool tattoos; do you have any scorpion tattoos?14Lauren: I do not.Alie: You don’t? Have you thought about it?Lauren: I’m scared about getting a scorpion tattoo because… I don’t know, like, I don’t want to gowith a cartoon one because I feel like it would bug me, and a real biologically accurate one,what if something came out wrong? And what if the drawing was wrong to start with and Ididn’t notice it? I would have to look at it for the rest of my life. Also, I do sometimes hatethem because research is really hard and I have those days like, “I HATE YOU! I don’t wantto look at you!” I look at you all day, and then I’d have to go home and look at it? Taking ashower and look at that scorpion? I don’t want to see those things.Alie: I have so many questions from listeners. Can I ask you?Lauren: Yeah.Alie: It’s kind of like a lightning round.Aside: Hooooo boy, so before we get to your Patreon questions, a few words from thefolks who sponsor the show. One thing about having ads is, I get to approve everyone Iendorse. And also, it makes donations to a cause of the ologist’s choosing possible. So, thisweek it’s so dope to donate to Islands & Seas. This a nonprofit that Lauren founded withEric Stiner. Islands & Seas is building these small field stations that serve as researchfacilities for scientists in the area. They also serve as centers for science in environmentaleducation for nearby schools. These stations are carbon-minimal, they reuse gray water,they harness green energy; they offer outreach programs for schools, internships forteenagers interested in science, field guide training. Ah! So good. IslandsSeas.org.Thank you Lauren and Eric for starting that. What total badasses with huge hearts andgreat brains. A donation is going to Islands & Seas; now a few words about sponsorsmaking that donation and the production of this very show possible.[Ad Break]Okay, back to your questions.Alie: This is kind of like a lightning round. Sonya Karp wants to know: Should they be kept aspets, and if yes, do they make good pets?Lauren: I’m gonna say yes. There’s no reason they shouldn’t be kept as pets, but like all things thatare kept in captivity, I think it’s really important to have captive bred ones because thenthat keeps people out of the natural ecosystems, from overharvesting, over-collecting forthe pet trade. There are a quite a few species that are really common in the pet trade thatare bred in captivity. If you want a scorpion as a pet, don’t go get it out of your backyard,leave it there. It’s doing something important in the ecosystem, rather buy one that’s beencaptive bred by a breeder.Alie: So, it’s the opposite of dogs.Lauren: Opposite of dogs.Alie: Don’t rescue one out of the wild.Lauren: They don’t need rescuing, they’re just fine on their own.Aside: I was like, “How much do scorpions cost?” And I found myself on a website sellingmedium emperor scorpions for $49.99. And they have a Live Arrive Guarantee. Which I 15guess when you think of it, it’s really an elite selection of people, who when mailed a box ofscorpions, would be disappointed to find that they are not alive scorpions.Alie: Alyssa Katehis wants to know: Why is it “in the scorpion’s nature to sting the frog”? Haveyou heard that fable?Lauren: Yeah, there’s that fable where the scorpion is on the frog’s back… the scorpion convincesthe frog to give it a ride across the river and says like, “Oh no, I’ll never sting you because ifI sting you then we’re both gonna die.” And then, stings it in the middle of the river and thefrog says, “Why?” and it says, “Because I’m a scorpion and it’s in my nature.” Ehhh… Uhhh...I mean, I guess the point of the fable is to say that people are who they are and they don’tchange.Aside: That’s the philosophical answer. Let’s look at this practically though.Lauren: But a scorpion sitting on a frog’s back would never sting the frog because they have alltheir eyes on top of their head and they wouldn’t even know what they’re doing.Alie: [laughs] Their eyes are on the top of their head?Lauren: Yeah, like facing up towards the sky.Alie: How many eyes do they have?Lauren: That depends. They almost all have three sets of eyes. Two in the middle and then a set ofthree to six in each corner of the front of their head. They’re arranged in a triangle. Somepeople have hypothesized that they use the triangular array of eyes to look up in the nightsky and navigate by the night stars.Aside: Oh, my stars! For those that enjoy a good crossword puzzle or are choked forconversation on a long car ride with your in-laws, navigating by stars is called‘astromenotaxis’. Astromenotaxis: you know that now.Alie: Nelson Chan has a question that I think you are going to enjoy answering.Lauren: Okay, I’m ready.Alie: Are all scorpions poisonous? And I know there’s a poison/venom discussion to be had.Lauren: There is. Scorpions are not poisonous, because poison is something that is secreted andthen when something else eats that thing, it makes them ill. All scorpions are venomous,which is something that is secreted and then injected into the destined host, like anotheranimal, so there’s a delivery apparatus for the venom. So, all scorpions are venomous, notall scorpions are venomous to humans because they don’t necessarily have that mammalneurotoxin but they’re all venomous to something.Alie: If you ate scorpion venom, would it be poisonous?Lauren: No, it’s a protein and your stomach acid would denature it.Alie: Ahh, so if you ate a scorpion, unless it stung you on the way down, you’re good to go.Lauren: You’re good to go.Alie: And then it would still be venomous because it wouldn’t be digested. So, poison versusvenom.16Lauren: But I would not recommend eating a thumbtack. So, in that sense maybe not eat thestinger just because it’s sharp and I don’t know what it’s going to do in your stomach. Itseems like a not a good look for anyone.Alie: And also, let them live. Let them live. “Can I live??”Jordan Jarrett wants to know: What is your opinion on the scorpion in Honey, I Shrunk theKids? They say, “I love animals but scorpions are the one animal that just creeps me out.”Did you ever see Honey, I Shrunk the Kids? Is there a scorpion in that?Lauren: Yeah, here’s what I’ll say about that scorpion. Scorpions are opportunistic predators sothey’ll basically eat anything they can get their hands on. They don’t forage during the day,and I want to say when that happens in the movie, it’s day time. So that’s inaccurate. It’salso an inaccurate species for where it was. But for sure, scorpions will eat anything theycan get their hands on, and that includes like if they can get a tiny gecko that they’re biggerthan, they’ll eat it. If another scorpion comes along, they’ll eat it. If it’s a cricket, they’ll eatit. If it’s a moth, they’ll eat it. But they have a really low metabolism, so that’s another thingthat makes them good pets. They have one of the lowest metabolisms. So, if you forget tofeed them for a year, they’ll be okay. If you forget a week, they’re going to survive.Alie: I didn’t know that. They’re like camels, kind of.Jay Owens has a question: If you remove their tails is it true they die from constipation?And what is the mechanism if that’s true?Lauren: So, maybe? I will say that there’s some truth to that in that their anus is actually at the endof their tail, right before their stinger.Alie: Really?Lauren: So, their rectum goes all the way through their entire tail and then… they have just, like, asingle cloacae thing that excretes everything. They don’t have a separate pee and poosituation. It all comes out right before the stinger. Maybe they could die of constipation?Because it would be ruptured and broken? But I think they’d probably just die of bloodloss, to be honest.Alie: That was actually Emmalee Hocking’s question: What is the waste management system ofa scorpion like? Where is the butt? Do they pee?Lauren: They do, they excrete uric acid, same as other things, and other waste products come outof their butt.Aside: There’s this one researcher Camilo Mattoni in Argentina who has observed thatsome scorpions will voluntarily break off their tails to escape. And yes, in that case, in theabsence of an anus, poo will just build up like emails you don’t want to check. Butsometimes, they can break off another tail segment to get rid of the poo and then continueto live just long enough to mate again. Like, [flirtatious] “Heyyyy, yeah, hi. I don’t have astinger. I do have this stumpy column of impacted poo happening. I got scared once andbroke off part of my body. But I would love a chance to just get to know you better. Maybehave several dozen babies.”Alie: Wade Lee… [“Hi Wade.]Lauren: Wade! Hey!Alie: Hi Wade! Wade wants to know: Is it true smaller scorpions are more venomous ingeneral? ☺17Lauren: It depends on where you are, so it’s not a simple yes or no answer. In some places, smallerscorpions belong to that one group Buthidae, so they’re more venomous. But in general, abetter frame of reference is if they have thin hands, and either a really long or a really fattail, they’re probably more venomous. If they have big fat hands and their hands are muchbroader than the width of their tails, then they’re less venomous. So, it’s not like theoverall body size, but the proportion of hands to tail situation.Aside: So, counterintuitively: big pinchers, less scary. [“You know what they say aboutmen with small hands. You can’t trust them.”]Alie: Dori Grijseels, there’s a lot of constants in that and I don’t know if I said that right: Notscorpion-related, but can you tell us about the 500 Queer Scientists initiative? Why didyou start it, why do you think it is important? Future plans? And Caroline Swift has thesame question, and says: As a queer scientist, I’d also love the answer to this. And a hugethank you to both Dr. E and you, and Dori for asking it.Lauren: Well I am queer and I’m an arachnologist, and I think for most of my professional careerand student life I kept those two aspects of my identity really separate. And when I startedmy position, I realized I was the only queer faculty member at my institution.Alie: Really?!Lauren: Yeah, and I’m in San Francisco! Like, that is really gay.Alie: I was gonna say, you're in San Francisco!Lauren: San Francisco is the gay mecca. So, I the only queer faculty member, and to my knowledgeI’m the only queer faculty member in the history of the institution.Alie: What??Lauren: First of all, we’re a small institution, so it’s not like a university that has hundreds andhundreds of professors. We have 15 faculty.Alie: But still.Lauren: But still, it’s San Francisco, right? And so I started thinking that if I feel this way, I feel likethose aspects of my personality are separate, I’m in a really queer-friendly place and I’mthe only queer faculty member, I feel kinda isolated in that sense. There must be peopleout there in parts of the world where being LGBT is not a protected class for jobs, likeyou would be fired if people found out at work that you were gay. Or if you’re just in aplace where culturally it feels unwelcomed to be out in the open. Surely if I feel this way inSan Francisco, there must be other people in other places.So, I decided that I would start a visibility campaign. It’s called 500 Queer Scientists, andwe have a website and also social media account on Twitter and Instagram. And we takeuser-contributed stories of scientists and science students at all levels. Undergraduates allthe way through deans of universities have contributed their story. And it’s really justpeople sharing their stories of what they do in STEM, and their identity as an LGBTQIAperson, and how those things fit together.I think it’s been great for the community to be able to identify each other because often it’sone of those attributes that’s hidden, it’s quiet, but it’s a really strong part of your personalidentity. So it’s hard to identify others that you can commiserate with, or have as rolemodels, or as colleagues that you feel comfortable sharing that part of your identity with. 18So, I think it’s been a great way for the community to find each other and connect with oneanother.Alie: How long ago did you start it?Lauren: We launched last June . I had collected 50 bios of people by email. Like, emailing all myfriends and asking them to email all of their friends. Two weeks later we had 500. Andnow we’re 8 months in and we have 850, and we’ve had over a million interactions onsocial media in those 8 months.Alie: And you started it?Lauren: Yeah, I started it. I started it with the help of others. But certainly it was my littlebrainchild and I’m really happy with what it’s become.Aside: So, you can find 500 Queer Scientists @500QueerScientists on Instagram or go to500QueerScientists.com. And you can read first-person stories, such as Charlotte, whosays:I am a lesbian and a chemistry student. I made the decision to return to education afterspending a long time selling phones for a living. For me, studying chemistry is the mostwonderful thing I have ever had the opportunity to do. It started when my wife and Ireturned from our honeymoon in New Zealand; all we could think about is ‘how do wego back there?’ We considered the usual ideas of learning a trade or something similarthen one day I woke up and it hit me… I nudged Bex and said “I want to go back toschool” she asked why, I told her I wanted to study chemistry, she replied “what for?”, “soI can teach it”. She simply replied “well go do it then”, rolled over and went back to sleep.And so here I am, a mature-ish student at the University of Manchester, chasing after aninterest in radiochemistry and a dream to teach at the academic level.Or Alexi who writes:I am bi and I am a wildlife educator, animal trainer, and artist. I floated through college,studying Biology and Social Psychology, not knowing what I wanted to do. In aninterview where I uttered the phrase “elephant diaper” the managers of the local zoo’seducation department saw something in me that I didn’t know was there. As someonewho was impacted by David Attenborough I never expected I could be doing the samefor kids of color (and all kids in general) on the ground. But here I am: educator, trainer,scientist; and mentor to several queer, teens of color.So, if there’s something missing from your day and that something is crying with pride fortotal strangers, and/or making some new friends, do check out 500 Queer Scientists. Andif you are a queer scientist and you’re looking for a place to find some community andmaybe share your story, look no further, fam. Follow the folks on there. Fill your feed withreally great scientists, fill your heart with joy and admiration.Alie: How has it changed your life having started it?Lauren: I think for me, the biggest change has been just been realizing other people that were notnecessarily in my field… Although I have met a few people now in the field of arachnologywho are queer – but in the greater field of entomology, which is the study of insects,doesn’t really include arachnology but they allow us to participate, it’s close enough. So,I’ve certainly met lots of entomologists, but I think also I’ve just realized how meaningful itis for people to realize that there are others out there. I’ve heard over and over from somany people at this point that prior to this campaign, that they had never met any other 19scientists in their field that was LGBT. So, I wasn’t alone, certainly. And I think that’s thereassuring part of it, that you’re not alone. There’re others. They’re out there. They’re justmaybe not as visible as we’d like them to be.Alie: Anything you would suggest for people to keep an eye on, or anything people can do to upthe inclusion, anything people could do to be allies, any advice for people who are like, “OhI’m not quite sure what I could do to help.”?Lauren: Some simple ways are just acknowledging people in the workplace or in your studentcommunity and asking like point blank if there’s ever anything that they can do. Or if youare witnessing something that would make them feel uncomfortable, or you perceive thatthey’re uncomfortable, to speak out so they don’t have to speak out. I think that that’shuge. Also, for me, that’s been one of the really great things about having run thiscampaign, by talking about it this much, this aspect of my identity, this much around mycolleagues who are heterosexual, non-transgender, gender-conforming, whatever, they’vebecome much bigger allies for me, like, huge advocates. And they have expressed theirdesire for advocacy in a way that prior to this they would have never done.So, for all the people who are LGBT out there, like taking the step of putting yourself outthere and expressing your needs to your colleagues, and telling them point blank how theycould help, is scary. It’s terrifying. But when you do it, they’re really appreciative of thatbecause they don’t necessarily know how to help you and how to be an ally. So just asking,which is… I think it’s always hard to ask for help no matter the context, but if you can findthe courage to do so, it makes a huge difference.Alie: You’re changing so many lives. It’s amazing!Lauren: Oh, I don’t know about that. It’s not me, it’s the community. Those 850 stories, only 1 ofthem is mine. But I’m happy to be the spokesperson for the community whenever I canbecause I am in a place of privilege where I can talk openly about my identity in myworkplace and not have any fear of retaliation or retribution and have the full support ofmy institution. So, I’m happy to do that work for the community when I can.Like there’s not that much information out there about the experience for LGBT people inthe workplace in STEM but the few things we do know, about 40% of queer facultymembers in academia and in industry are not out. So, there’s a lot of people out there whoare not comfortable expressing that part of their identity because of fear of retribution.Which is a valid fear, because surveys have shown that of faculty members that are out,70% of them have been made to feel excluded or harassed at work by their colleagues.So, there’s like a huge motivation not to be out, even though being out is great for thecommunity, it’s great for future students, it’s great to be a role model. But there’s so manyreasons not to do it because you’re going to be uncomfortable at work, it’s going to beterrible. You don’t want to do that. So, I think it’s hard to feel that you’re in a space that’scomfortable enough to be out and to be visible.Alie: So they can commiserate and hear other people’s stories. That’s amazing. I’m so glad thatyou did that. You’re doing so many good things!Lauren: Scorpions and queer people. Who knew? That’s a thing. I don’t know of any queerscorpions.Alie: Oh, there’s got to be some of them out there.Lauren: Maybe, there’s lots of examples of weird things in nature.20Alie: They’re just under a rock! They’re so much more fluidity in nature.Lauren: So much gender fluidity, right? And yet as humans we want to dichotomize it, it’s so crazy.Alie: I know! The snails episode, we talk a lot about, you know, BYOG, bring your own gennies.Lauren: Yeah. Hermaphroditic.Alie: [laughs] Yeah! And the last couple of questions that I always ask: What’s the worst thingabout your job, or the most annoying thing about scorpions? What’s the shittiest aspectabout being a scorpiologist?Lauren: You know, I think, the hardest thing about working in science in this moment in time inthis country, especially, is the funding, it’s so tough. And I think in the field that I work in,which is evolutionary biology, the successful funding rate to the main place that we applyfor funding, The National Science Foundation Government Grants… The success rate isabout 4%.Alie: Oof.Lauren: So as an early career scientist, breaking into that… because you know, almost certainlythat 4% is not evenly distributed across all genders, ethnicities, and stages of career. It’scertainly biased because the people who are more senior, are more established, tend to bemore white, more male, and are better at getting grants. So, to be an early careerresearcher trying to break into a 4% funding rate is daunting and hard, and it makes itreally hard to find enough money to do the thing that you want to do and feel is a reallyimportant contribution to society.Alie: Do you have to write all of your own grants?Lauren: I do. I submit, probably, three or so a year. Each of those take months and months to craft,and it’s time away from research which is what I really love and really want to be doing.Alie: Yeah, ooof. And now, best thing about scorpions, best thing about your job? What do youlove the most?Lauren: You know I love my job because I get to wear so many hats. And I’m at an institution thatwas such a good match for me, which is why I wanted to work there. The CaliforniaAcademy of Sciences is an incredible museum because it’s equally committed to scienceoutreach, which is something I really love doing, and really high-quality science research.So, for me those two aspects of my work life, I always felt like I was going to have to giveup one for the other. Like in a faculty job at a university, I was going to have to give up theoutreach because that’s like extracurricular. It’s not something that’s considered in yourannual review or your job performance.Or doing science outreach, I would have to give up science because there’s very fewscience outreach jobs where you can still engage as much as you need to in the scienceresearch itself. But I found a really great fit, and I think for me that’s the great thing aboutgoing to work every day. They love all of the things I’m doing including running a littlenon-profit that’s focused on conservation and doing a visibility campaign for queerscientists. And it’s nice to be somewhere where I can bring all of me to the job.Alie: It’s a beautiful place!Lauren: It is. It is. Going to work every day, it’s not so bad.Alie: Oh man. If you’re in San Francisco, go, go, go. It’s just... Ah, I could just spend days there.21Lauren: I just, like, walk through the park to work in the morning. I see coyotes, and there arecrows quaking, and red-tail hawks soaring through the air. It’s pretty amazing and special.Lately we have a turkey that lives in our business entrance, and she just hangs out in thelittle walkway, fluffing up her feather and walking around. There’s lots of different namesfor her. Everybody’s got a different name for her.Alie: What do you call her?Lauren: I call her Bernadette.Alie: Okay. [laughs joyously]Lauren: Bernadette. I didn’t make the name up, someone else did, but that’s my favorite one. I feellike Bernadette’s a real turkey kind of name. She’s a pretty turkey too.Alie: It is a very good turkey name. Oh my god, I need to come back and visit. Thank you somuch for doing this.Lauren: Ah, thank you! This was great.Alie: I have been gently prodding you for too long.Lauren: We’ve been like ships in the night. We could never manage to meet up, huh?Alie: I’m so excited we did it.Lauren: We did it!it’s your uncle’s army buddy who makes superb banana bread, Alie Ward, back withanother episode of Ologies. First off, I know you. You’re either like, “The fuck is a hagfish?” or you’relike, “Aaaah yes, hagfish! But an hour of hagfish?” Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Here’s a secret you need toknow: We are all hagfish. We’re shy sometimes but we have friends, we have preferences, we canmake do, we have hidden talents, sometimes people underestimate us until they realize oursuperpowers and then they stand back and they marvel, and by marvel, I mean listen to a wholeepisode about hagfish.But before we dive into the deep sea of this slimy hour, let’s first, by tradition, thank all the folks onPatreon.com/Ologies who make these episodes possible - we’ll hear some of their hagfish querieslater! - and to all the folks buying Ologies merch at the link in the show notes and sporting it. And ofcourse to all of you kind souls who have rated and subscribed to the pod and also left your reviewsfor ol’ Dadward, which I read by lantern light with a tear in my eye. This week Jen Bagels just wrote:Alie, I hope you really do read every review because I want you to know that the world is abetter place because you’re in it.I don’t deserve that! That’s too nice! Don’t make me cry. K sup HD, which I guess I’m realizing justnow is KSU PhD, so sorry, says:Here’s a tip: don’t cherry-pick the episodes you think you’ll be interested in, just binge them all.They’re all delightful!Thanks, K sup HD. Okay! Hagfish, Haaaaagfish.Okay, first off, you’re going to have to wait to hear how hagfish got its name. Sorry, it was a commonPatreon question so we’re gonna address it later. This is as clickbaity as I get. Secondly, YES, theterm ‘hagfishology’ has been used before, I did not make it up. A 2013 biology graduate students’seminar schedule included the talk, Adventures in Hagfishology: Sulphate transport and extrabranchial mechanisms of ion regulation in Pacific Hagfish, by Alex Clifford. So Hagfishology: thetitle’s legit, haters.This episode exists because science journalist Ed Yong wrote an article for the Atlantic in Januarywith the headline “No One Is Prepared for Hagfish Slime”, and he was SO right. It included photosfrom a 2017 traffic accident in Oregon in which 7,500 pounds of hagfish tipped over on a winding,forested highway and slicked the roads and the cars in incomprehensible amounts of slime. Iimmediately started googling ’hagfish scientists.’ I had a few on the list and was thrilled to see thatthey were based in Southern California. They were on my spreadsheet.A few weeks ago, my friend, wildlife educator Mallory Lindsey, who is amazing, went to the samelab! I messaged her and I was like, “I’VE BEEN WANTING TO DO AN EPISODE ON THIS. HOW ARETHEY?” The next day, my phone rang; it was a hagfishologist, just using the phone, like it was 1997!So charming. So we met a few days later on a street corner near Chapman campus in OrangeCounty, he has a bright smile, surfer-esque golden hair, and a ruddy beard, and we drove around 2looking for parking because, again this is Southern California, and then we hit the lab and heshowed me gurgling, chilly, saltwater tanks filled with a few dozen soft, pinkish-purplish-greyfloppy hot dogs with mouths.He let me cradle one in my open palm, and it felt like a very floppy hot dog. Like if God put a face onan intestine and just stopped there. Were these specimens slimy? Not really, until this ologist urgedme to annoy one. “Give it a little pinch,” he coaxed. Milliseconds later, it seemed, my hand wasdrenched in a thick veil of elephant snot. I was transfixed. Hagfish are disgusting AND they deserveour respect.This ologist, as you will hear from the dulcet tones of his Canadian accent, hails from the North andgot his Bachelor’s and Master’s studying Zoology at the University of Guelph. Whilst there, hehappened to take an invertebrate zoology class with hagfish master, Dr. Douglas Fudge, with whomhe now works as a research associate at Chapman.So, prepare to hear about swift escapes, outlasting extinction events, the mysteries of the deep, whyyou - I guess - don’t always need a spine, eating your way out of a dead thing, disappearing withouta trace, and, like a slippery messiah, converting water into slime, with human delight andprofessional Hagfishologist, Tim Winegard.-----------Alie Ward: I don't know if you know this, but you are technically a hagfishologist.Dr. Tim Winegard: I don't know if I've ever heard it put that way, but I'm probably one of few,yeah! [laughs]Alie: I looked it up to see if there was a more Latin-sounding name, and the term that's been usedthe most to describe what you study is literally hagfishology. People have used that wordbefore, [laughs] so it's a thing, hagfishology.Tim: Let’s go with, we’ll run with it.Alie: What is a hagfish, for someone who's never seen or touched one?Tim: I guess the best way to describe them is they are a benthic deep-sea dweller; essentially allhagfish share that in common. They all live along the bottom substrate of the oceans and themajority of them below a hundred meters in depth, or about 300 feet.Aside: This ologist jumps between metric and U.S.-why-are-we-still-not-metricmeasurement, so I don’t have to convert it. Thank friggin god.Tim: What they are is a jawless, primitive, eel-like creature. I'm hesitant to call them a fish, eventhough it's in their name, because they aren't necessarily a traditional fish. They lack scales,they lack jaws, they lack eyes, they lack what we traditionally refer to as fins. So, in manyways, they’re a very primitive version of a modern-day fish. They are thought to havediverged at around the same time that vertebrates popped up on the evolutionaryspectrum.Alie: So, these suckers are old! [clip from The Simpsons: “My GOD you’re so old.”] How any millionsof years do you think?3Tim: There is fossil evidence up to 350 million years, but they're likely over 500 million yearsold; among some of the first really highly organized cephalized - which essentially meanshead-focused - creatures. Hagfish, for a long time were defined as craniates, which meansthat they have a cranium surrounding their brain, but they have no calcification of anythingin their body, so it's all cartilage. They do have a notochord, they have many of thesefeatures that are very vertebrate, in a way, but lacking calcification, lacking gills, lackingjaws, all these other features place them in a much more… I even hesitate to say primitive,but I guess they are primitive features. Even though hagfish themselves are… obviously, asancient as they are, they're also very modern. The hagfish we see today, we really don'tknow how much they relate to the hagfish of the past.Aside: P.S. If you’re like, “Notochord?” I got you. A notochord is, by definition, a‘cartilaginous skeletal rod supporting the body’. You had one! You had one as a teeny tinyembryo. It’s like a backbone in that it gives support and structure, but it’s not a backbone inthat it’s not bony, segmented vertebrae. Oh, and the hagfish has a brain case that isn’t askull, it’s a little cartilage rib cage around their brain lump. And in the hagfish world, therehas been decades of heated, dramatic – that’s how I like to imagine it – debate on whetherhagfish never developed a backbone, or if they had one and then just devolved the otherway to gradually get rid of the sucker. Oh, and their eyes, and their skull. Kind of like ahandsome, lanky drifter, who is also slimy and eats corpses; their backstory is still amystery.Tim: Through fossil evidence, of which there are only two, it makes it a bit of a limited jump interms of what you can say.Alie: There's two fossils of Hagfish?Tim: Yeah. Soft-bodied creatures don't fossilize well. When they die and end up in the bottomsediment, their tissues are so similar to everything else around them that they don't end updistinct, like other animals with calcium or real bones in their body do.Alie: Who's got those two fossils? Where are they?Tim: That's a good question. One of them was just discovered and published by a group inAlberta, and then the other one - that's a good question. It's been quite a while since I readthe paper, but they would be in museums; there's only two of them known.Aside: Y’all, I spent so long trying to find out where these two fossils are, and I can tellyou that one was discovered in Mazon Creek, Illinois, I think around 1991, and the other isfrom Lebanon and was acquired in 2013 by a private fossil-collecting company. I earnestlyjust spent two hours trying to figure out if I could go on a road trip and see a hagfish fossil inperson. And the lack of information on their whereabouts has led me to believe that they’reboth kept in a subterranean vault with the holy grail, or they’re kicking it, like ballers, in atimeshare with Bigfoot.Alie: So precious.Tim: Yeah. Super precious, and like I was saying, very rare, but as we uncover more fossil beds,there are particular fossilization conditions that lend themselves to preserving soft-bodiedanimals better. I think there was just a big deposit found in China in the last couple of weeks 4that has a lot of soft-bodied creatures, but I think it's more in the 350-million, 450-millionyear range.Alie: Going back a little bit less far than that; your history. When you were just a tiny tot in [goofyvoice] Canadia, did you always love poking around lakes and forests? What was going on?Tim: Oh yeah, for sure. My mom always used to say that if she needed to distract me, she wouldjust say that she saw something in that puddle [laughs] and I’d be pretty consumed for quitea while. [clip from Kendrick Lamar song King Kunta: “Something’s in the water, something’s inthe water.”] Honestly, I don’t think there’s a time when I didn’t like science in some way. Iwanted microscopes when I was six and brought home every creepy-crawly I could find.Actually, I collected butterflies, my original plan as a child was to be an entomologist.Alie: Really?Tim: Yeah. I collected large numbers of butterflies from all over the world, wherever we went.Alie: And then where did you flutter away from them and into a hagfish tank?Tim: That would have been in university when, I guess, the opportunities to study tropicalbutterflies were limited in Canada, [laughs] [“It’s butterfly time.”] so that's when ithappened. I think it was right around 2007, through meeting Doug and getting introducedto hagfish, and then sort of being brought into the fold, as it was, into the world of hagfish.There's, sort of, no end of amazement; that's what's kept me here. That almost any questionyou can ask about hagfish, there likely isn't a concrete answer.Alie: And so, when Doug said, “Hey, come on back, study some hagfish with me.” what was yourresponse to that?Tim: Oh, I think it took a bit of prodding because I really did enjoy the Wildlife Research Stationand living out in the woods there. But you know, obviously we're sitting here in beautiful,sunny, Southern California, which didn't hurt.Aside: Have you heard a more Canadian sentence: [“I really did enjoy the WildlifeResearch Station and living out in the woods there.”] And Tim says he loves doing appliedresearch on these critters, figuring out how to use the slime to inform human-madealternatives. His master’s work was looking at how we can use these 15cm-long threadsthat spring forth from the hagfish as a fiber source and get away from petrochemical-basedfibers, like acrylic, nylon, and polyester. So, although he misses the wilderness, trading in hisparka for board shorts wasn’t all that tough.Tim: I think that my heart's always been into hagfish. In some ways, I think it didn’t take toomuch! I think that the right projects, the right people, all sort of lend themselves to a goodtime in science.Alie: And so, explain to me what the life of a hagfish is like. Where are they living? What are theyeating? Who are they hanging out with? What's going on down there?Tim: I think we all wish we knew. What we do know is that they're very sensitive to temperatureand light, so they are a deep-sea specialist, they seek out cold water. There is maybe onlyone species that's found inside of a hundred meters of depth, called the inshore hagfish(which is found in Japan), but other than that, they're all very deep-sea. They feed on a 5variety of not only small tube worms and other invertebrates, but also scavenge largewindfalls of whales, and seals, and sea lions, and big fish that fall down into the ocean deep.[“That’s deep.”]Aside: Remember the Teuthology episode with Sarah MacAnulty about marine snow?That soft, steady, underwater dusting of poo and flesh chunks? Well, a dead whale is like amarine blizzard, and hagfish love a snow day.Tim: We know, or at least we think, that they play an important role in that bottom compositionturnover. When things do fall into the deep, there are conditions that can lend themselves topreserving something like a whale for years; low temperatures, low oxygen, so maybe thebacterial decomposition is not as prevalent. There would be bacterial decomposition, but Ithink there's a place for hagfish in actually cleaning up the bottom in that way, and thenspreading the nutrients around. So as they feed, they obviously leave, go back to theirburrows or go back to where they're living, and bring nutrients with them, and essentiallyhelp spread nutrients in an otherwise very desert-like deep sea environment.Aside: [Alie, rapping: “Smell it, find it, munch it, poop it, spread it.”]Alie: We were looking in the tank and some of them are all coiled up, some of them are justhanging out in a tube. What's their day-to-day life like?Tim: In terms of what we know about where they live, some have a tendency to be in moremuddy, sandy bottoms. Those species are typical burrowers, they'll actually live in burrowsin the mud, and typically sit there with just their nostril sticking out, looking for whiffs ofwhale or seals. But the other ones do spend time on rocky bottoms and I think those are thespecies that tend to coil up a bit more, because they're just spending a lot more time on thesurface as opposed to within the substrate.There's been interesting work as well showing that hagfish have handedness. They have atendency to coil either right or left, more than the other way, so they have a preference. Ithink in captivity there's probably only, maybe, five or six common species for people tohave in captivity. There are a number of species that do not do well at all, so they're reallyhard to keep in artificial environments, essentially. I think partially that’s because it's reallyhard to replicate the pressure that they're used to living in. We can replicate temperature,and salinity, and pH, and all these other environmental parameters, but it's really hard torecreate being a mile below the surface of the ocean.Alie: Right. And how are they making baby hagfish?Tim: Nobody knows.Alie: WHAT!Tim: Yeah. Nobody has ever witnessed hagfish breeding.Alie: Wow.Tim: Nobody has ever had hagfish successfully breed in captivity, even unseen, to produce fertileeggs. So, we have hagfish laying eggs in captivity all the time, but they’re presumablyunfertilized because they never develop. This is something that I'm really interested in aswell: Is there seasonality in the deep sea? Even though it's dark and cold all year, are they 6more attuned to those deep-sea conditions and maybe sense the difference in lunar phases?Do they have a migration? Are they always in the same place all the time? I think that theyare moving throughout the season, but not a lot is known about it because it's so hard tofollow these things into the deep.A lot of the technology that's used for tracking fish and other stuff isn't at either the sizescale that could be used in hagfish, or the fish need to come to the surface to get data pingsand hagfish never will. They're really tough to follow. We’ve got a new underwater video rigthat we're going to use to try and at least peer into their lives a little bit.Alie: Would you think that they would be following the whales in case a whale does bite the dustand falls down?Tim: I think whales are typically undergoing such large migrations that hagfish wouldn't be, say,following the herd. I think their low metabolism suits them well to possibly go a year ormore without feeding. Even in captivity, we typically only feed them every three to sixmonths.Alie: What?! [slowed down: “Whaaaat?”]Tim: Yeah. Yeah. They eat a lot, when they eat, but they don't eat frequently.Alie: Wow. What do you feed them in captivity?Tim: They get a bit of a mixture. There's shrimp, and squid, and beef, and sometimes otherrandom large fish that we come across in our work. I think we fed them an opah, which is avery interesting fish.Aside: Okay so quick aside, researching opah got a lot of hits on Oprah. It’s a different thing.An opah is a big, silvery, round fish, also called a moonfish - it looks like a moon - and opahare one of the rare endothermic fishes, which means, like Oprah, it has a warm heart.Tim: We feed them a diversity of stuff, hopefully trying to get them the right nutritionalrequirements they need. But again, it's something that is not really well understood, andsomething that we're looking to do more on is gathering gut contents from hagfish.Alie: Would you just drop like a pot roast in the tank and they go nuts on it?Tim: Essentially. Yeah.Alie: What does that look like?Tim: It's a bit of a feeding frenzy. They're all going at it. It's really interesting as well, though,because they lack appendages and they don't have a jaw. If it is actually a big pot roast, theyactually tie themselves into knots that they slide against the pot roast to actually tug on it.Alie: Oh my God.Tim: Yeah. So, they tie the same knots to rid themselves of slime, but they have a very unique wayof actually latching onto something without jaws.Alie: So, they can pull at it and get some resistance?Tim: Exactly.7Alie: Have you ever seen a hagfish eating a whale?Tim: Only in film. I've never seen it in real life, I would love to.Alie: Do they go into the whale and then borrow out?Tim: Yeah, they are definitely spending a lot of time inside the whale. A recent study waspublished actually showing that they can absorb amino acids across their skin. So, part oftheir low metabolism, their ability to deal with low oxygen, all of these unique adaptationsreally allow them to live that lifestyle [Jacob from Twilight: “It’s not a lifestyle choice, Bella.”]and to go into a whale, in which oxygen concentrations could be quite low, bacterial levelshigh, all this other stuff, they're perfectly at home, may feed there for months on end.Alie: For months! Just gorging, and then be like, bye-bye, and then go hang out for a year. Wow,that's so efficient, I have to say. Good for them, they take on a lot of cargo and then just kickit for a bit.Tim: Yeah. I think we see that with anything that has withstood the test of hundreds of millions ofyears. That they're typically generalists, right? You know, something like a crocodile can eatanything, can go months and months without eating. There's certain life historycharacteristics that lend themselves to withstanding mass extinctions and all of the climaticchanges that impact very niche-specific species.Aside: After this interview, Tim and I went and ate tacos, and I realized later that, despiteflinging around wet loaves of hagfish mucus in the lab earlier, neither one of us washed ourhands. But we also had a spirited discussion about the importance of a diverse microbiome,so I think we were on the same “so what” page there.Also, at lunch he mentioned that the hagfish traps are like buckets with a few conical portsthat funnel the hagfish in so they can’t get out. What do they use to lure them into thebucket? Turns out that hagfish love the smell of big mammal bones and fat, so they toss afleshy beef bone in there, and I was like, “Do they get to eat it?”, and he’s like, “Nah, thatwould mess up their gut content data.” So the beef bones are in a mesh bag, meaning thatthe hagfish smell it, find it, but can’t munch it, poop it or spread it. The hagfish have beencatfished.Alie: They tend to eat the bigger things like a whale, a sea lion? Is that kind of what their breadand butter is, it’s all, “Man, there's a big whale. It's big and dead floating down here. It'sThanksgiving!” What's happening?Tim: Yeah. I think that's the real train of thought that we're on, essentially that a lot of theirfeatures, a lot of their adaptations, would lend themselves to really capitalizing on those bigwhale falls or big mammal falls. They have very low metabolisms. If you compared them to avertebrate, they'd have one of the lowest metabolisms of any vertebrate.Alie: Really??Tim: Yeah, they live slow. [repeated in slo-mo: “They liiiiive slooooow.”] We’ve observed themabsolutely gorging at these deep-sea sites, so they just fill their guts to the point that theymay be many times their original mass. [clip from Game of Thrones: “I was hungry.”] To beable to do that makes you think that this is predominantly what they're doing, but we also 8see that they do feed on tube worms and these other invertebrates that are found in thesediment in which the hagfish live.Alie: Can you run me through some body parts of a hagfish?Tim: Yeah. I guess if you're to have a hagfish out on the table, they do have a head, and they havebarbells at the end of the head, which are essentially their chemical-sensing devices.Alie: Is that like a catfish?Tim: Catfish have barbels as well, so yeah. They'd be packed with what we call ‘chemosensorycells’ that would be picking up things like the scent of dead or decaying fish, or a whale.They start with those, then they have a very large intake aperture for their gill system.Aside: Seawater gets snorkeled through their face snoot, and then that water is expelledthrough these breathing holes on the side. They’re kinda like a slimy water flute thatsomeone sewed from a de-boned baby. Anyway, they smell like champs.Tim: It also feeds into a sack very close to their brain. They have, probably, an incredible abilityto detect very faint smells, which makes sense if they're potentially hundreds of metersfrom something that fell, or maybe even further.They have very primitive eyes. If you look at a lot of the hagfish they don't have the type ofeyes that we would normally associate with a fish. Theirs actually don’t even protrudethrough the skin; there is a transparent layer of skin that covers a very rudimentary eye,that was likely more developed at one time, but was just not selected for, and theyessentially lost its full functionality.Aside: So, eyes? Pffft. We’re off that. Had ‘em, lost ‘em. Baller. Now what’s happening withthat mouth? First of all, it has these whiskery flesh-dangles that look kinda like a tinyhandlebar mustache made outta little dicks. But don’t go looking for jaws here. No, no sir.They have what Tim calls a ’muscular appendage’ inside their mouth, and it juts out thislittle paddle of hard, jagged spikes, kinda like a snail’s tongue. Imagine if your tongue hadrows and rows of those things in parking lots that will pop your tires if you drive the wrongway on them. So yeah, hagfish; they deserve our respect.Tim: Essentially, there are these keratinous teeth, the same material that makes up ourfingernails makes up their rasp, which they use to essentially sand tissue off of a carcass, orto slurp up a little worm that they’re after. Then when you look at the rest of them, theyvary a little bit in terms of their gill apertures that water flows out of. The more burrowingspecialist hagfish will have reduced numbers of gill openings in which the water flows outof.Aside: Again, water flute. Now all of this is just the tater-skins, the jalapeno poppers,appetizers before we get to the main course because here’s where things get slimy. Now, ifyou’ve listened to previous episodes of Ologies, or the first 12 seconds of this one, you knowthat I don’t censor language. [“The fuck is a hagfish?”] Most science podcasts bleep outquestionable swear words, but I embrace raw emotion and freedom of adult expression inscience communication (in this podcast at least) with the exception of the word… mucus.It’s too gross. It comes up between 10-15 times in the remainder of this episode. So, whenyou hear a faint chime, [mucus ding] please know it’s replacing the word mucus. Please feel 9free to take a glug of your beverage in front of you, or do a tiny imperceptible butt dance tocelebrate the absence of this word.Tim: And then as you move into the rest of the body, you'll notice along the ventral side that theyhave about a 100-150 slime gland openings. They're literally covered head to tail with theseglands that produce their defensive slime. Whether they’re bitten on the head or on the tail,they can, in a fraction of a second, like less than 100 milliseconds, produce copiousquantities of this fiber-reinforced slime. [splat]Alie: Which is… Astounding. [Riff Raff from The Rocky Horror Picture Show: “It’s astounding.”] Forsomething that is maybe not as advanced as some other vertebrates, this is a defensesystem that is still very much mysterious, in terms of how it works, right?Tim: I think, yeah. If everything else about the hagfish, we would call “primitive,” this is highlyderived. This is unlike anything else found in nature. We know of a lot of mucuses, we knowof a lot of natural fiber sources like silkworm silks or spider silks, but the hagfish threadsthat are found in their slime are not only comparative to spider silks, in terms of theirmechanical properties, that they're incredibly tough, but they produce this stuff inprodigious quantities.Aside: This cannot be overstated.Tim: An individual hagfish may have 20,000 kilometers of fiber in its body at any one time. Andwhat's so unique about these fibers is that they're packaged into 15cm fiber lengths, butthat's coiled into 150-micron cell, so in a little bit more than a 10th of a millimeter, theypack 15cm of thread into.Aside: To put that into perspective, the threads that make up this water-trapping slimenetwork are 10 million times longer than they are wide, and they are somehow neatlycoiled like a skein of yarn into a tiny cell capsule, ready to be ejected and unfurl. More onhow that works in a minute – but admit it, you love hagfish. How are they coiling this? Whatis their gooey witchcraft? You are intrigued.Tim: That process, in and of itself, has been something that has really intrigued us for quite sometime.Alie: Is it hard for them to make more of it? If they slime someone and they're like, “Bye, bye!”[clip from Broad City: “Later.”] do they have to go sit and produce more? Is that energyexpensive for them?Tim: The fibers are made up of protein, which in general is quite expensive to make, but one ofthe unique things that the hagfish does by having so many slime glands is that it neverdeploys them all at once. They do have some site specificity; if you bite it on the tail, it mayonly release exudate, which is what we call the condensed slime… It may only release a fewglands worth, like two or three glands on either side of its body, which is enough to producea gallon of form slime. So, like, they would never be caught without slime, ever. They justhave so much on board, and there's some indication as well that they can't actually releaseall of the slime from a single gland, because they likely retain the immature cell components,which would otherwise maybe be released, but not function as they should.Alie: What happens when these fibers hit water?10Tim: That’s something that's really interesting to us. It's a two-component slime. It's released bywhat's called ‘holocrine secretion’, which means that the cells are actually having theirmembranes stripped off of them as they go through the pore of the slime gland. It narrowsdown to a tiny opening that strips the cells of their membranes, so that when they'rereleased to sea water, they are exposed to an entirely new environment. [Kate Holbrookfrom Baby Mama: “Water!”] There’s an interaction with the seawater, essentially thesolubilization of proteins that help maintain these fibers in their coiled-up state, but whathappens is that the seawater very rapidly bursts the m* [ding] vesicles that are released,they shear out into these long strands, which essentially transmit forces of mixing down tothe thread bundles.Aside: [sports commentator effect] Instant replay…. aaaand the hagfish takes the offense,defense ejects tiny coiled balls of the exudate, getting their little membrane covers strippedas they exit. The threads hit the water and exxxxpand, trapping more water in a net ofmicrofiber threads, expanding TEN! THOUSAND! times its size Slime! Predator offenseretreats, down for the count, hagfish remains the champion of the deep!Or in Tim’s words:Tim: To simplify what I just said, the m* [ding] is released, really vigorous mixing that's createdby either the hagfish trying to escape or the predator trying to eat the hagfish furtherexpands this network of m* [ding] and fiber, until it forms this fully formed slime ball, whichis capable of fully clogging the gills of a 10-foot shark. We've never seen a successfulpredation on a hagfish by any gill-breathing predator. We see sea lions, birds, porpoises,these are all successful hagfish predators because their breathing mechanisms areseparated from their eating mechanism, essentially, just like us. We can breathe and eat atthe same time, whereas most gill-breathing fish can't. They're breathing all the time, andthat is what exposes them to the slime.Aside: So… Ya got gills? Ya got screwed.Alie: That slime will just clog their actual respiration, and they’re like, “I’m out.”?Tim: Exactly. It shuts the water flow from going across their gills, and we actually don't knowwhat happens to them, because all of the video work that's been done has happened withwild, free-living animals. When the sharks or the fish gets slimed, they quickly leave thevideo frame, and we actually don't know whether they actually die, or whether any of theseanimals can get the slime off their gills. It just gets wrapped around everything with milesand miles of fiber, it's very easy for it to just get wrapped around things and stay there.[laughs]Alie: Man. And so, how much of this slime is actually water, and how much is the fiber protein?Tim: So, when the exudate is released into seawater and fully sets up, it is over 99% seawater.Essentially, hagfish slime can be formed in any container, it'll conform to the shape ofalmost anything. We did a study that showed that it's actually one of the softest materialsknown to man; it's very deformable.Aside: This study was “Concentration-independent mechanics and structure of hagfishslime” and one of the paper’s authors, Randy Ewoldt, told the Atlantic’s Ed Yong that hagfish 11slime is one of the softest materials ever measured and, “Jell-O is between 10,000 and100,000 times stiffer than hagfish slime.” I have touched it, and it’s some soft, silky business,and then I went and touched nachos, because I’m 10,000 times tougher than Purell,apparently.Tim: But when it's put into elongational flow or stretched, that’s when the fibers and thereinforcement properties start to be felt, because they're actually incredibly strong whenyou stretch them.Alie: What do you think are some applications of hagfish slime? Are people looking at this beinglike, [conspiratorial laugh] “Mwahaha!”?Tim: I think so. It's such a unique mechanism. I think, first of all, the speed with which the slimesets up interests people, because whatever is happening (and we've been trying to figurethis out for years) happens so quickly that it's likely one of the fastest reactions that weknow of, it’s so incredibly fast. I think we could maybe learn not only how to bundle,unbundle or uncoil things, but also how to develop rapidly expanding gel networks; thatcould be an interesting application. The fibers themselves, I've always been interested inactually using for textile. They're very, very fine; they are micron in diameter. Even whenyou think of microfiber clothing, which is so soft, that stuff is like 30 to 50 microns indiameter, so it's much finer.Aside: Let’s get some scale for microns, real quick. A micron is one millionth of a meter,and a human hair is around 50-100 microns in diameter. A red blood cell is 5 micronsacross. The human eye can’t see much smaller than around 40 microns. So yes, hagfish silkwould be luxurious as hell.Tim: It would probably make THE softest t-shirt. [laughs]Alie: What would you have to do to get it from a puddle of m* [ding] to a loom? Would you haveto dry it out?Tim: I think that you'd probably want to isolate the thread bundles and then work with them ontheir own. I think the biggest challenge right now is that it is such a narrow fiber that any ofthe equipment that's used right now to spin textiles is not built at a scale that could handleit.Alie: Now, there’s a picture that went around the Internet that made everyone question what thedeal was with hagfish, this photo of a car that got into an accident and it was carrying a tonof hagfish and there was slime EVERYWHERE. [clip from The Matrix: “It is all around us.”]Can you give me any backstory, or any thoughts on that?Tim: Well, there is a commercial hagfish fishery; hagfish are used as food products in places likeKorea, they’re eaten, but also, for a quite a few years, their skin was used to make “eel skinleather” products. So, if anybody has something that's called eel skin leather, it's actuallyprobably hagfish. They made belts and wallets and handbags, and still do to this day. It'slikely that that transport had a bunch of hagfish that were going to market and when it gotinto the accident, it stressed the hagfish out, and they started producing slime.Aside: So, this happened on the coast of Oregon near Depoe Bay, and the photos are[whispering] bananas. It looks like these giant earthworms covered in silvery ectoplasm, on 12a two-lane highway, covering the whole thing. They’re slithering toward the gutter, a 4-carpileup looks like a giant sneezed on it. There are bulldozers scooping up slime eels, asthey’re called, by the hundreds. They’re hosing off the road with 5,000 gallons of water, andthen just letting them die there on the shoulder. Hagfish, quite frankly, deserve morerespect. The local CBS affiliate was on the scene.[clip from the CBS News YouTube clip]“I had no choice but to get out, and I was walking in it. [laughs] It was ugly.”“An errant butler had a miss with all that fish!”“On the ground… It was still moving. It was liquid eels!”Alie: Oh, poor hagfish.Tim: Yeah.Alie: Can you imagine if we did that when we were just stressed out? Like, “I'm having a day,guys. I’m covered in m* [ding].” [laughing] Is there a difference between m* [ding] andslime?Tim: Well, I think that's a good question. I'm not sure how much ‘slime’ is a technical term. I thinkthat maybe all slimes have m* [ding].Alie: Okay.Tim: You know, but maybe not all m* [ding] are slimes. [laughing]Alie: It’s very possible. [laughing]Tim: Yeah, like with hagfish slime, maybe we call it a slime because it's a two-part system.Whereas something like a snail that leaves a m*[ding] trail, it's really just m* [ding]. Maybethat's what it is, but I guess you call it snail slime too.Alie: Yeah. I'm going look that up.Aside: Okay, I looked into this distinction and the M-word is made by membranes and‘slime’ is derived from the root word for sticky mud or marsh, but it now also means “ding”(you know what I mean). Different roots but technically now interchangeable. Just in caseyou need that in your everyday life.Alie: Your day-to-day work with hagfish, what does it involve? What are you looking at? What'sthe process?Tim: Well, my work right now is looking at whether or not hagfish slime can be used toessentially block the flow of water around different objects, like a boat propeller or a gratesystem, or how we can use its natural tendency to clog and reduce water flow in usefulways. One idea might be that you can mix it into an oil slick, and bind the water and the oilinto it, and then remove it that way. That's not something we're currently working on, but Ialways had that interest – in that it mops up water so well – that I'd be interested to seewhat it could do with potential contamination and waterways and other things.Alie: How do you think hagfish are portrayed in the media?Tim: I think people love to hate them, which is sort of sad to me as well. I think that, like anythingin the ocean, it's not on our radar a lot. Once we move off of land into the sea, it's quite 13literally another world, and when you move from the shallow seas into the deep sea, it's likeouter space. [Alie laughs] I think that, as humans, we tend to look at things that havefeatures that are similar to ours. If they have big eyes, they’re cute, you know, we look forthose features, and I think hagfish pretty much lack everything that we can associate with.[both laugh] That probably lends it to seeming like an ugly worm-like, eel-like creature, butI'd say that the more you work with them the cuter they become, and your respect leveldefinitely goes up.Alie: Do you have favorite hagfish in the tank? Are you like, “What's up buddy?”Tim: I think so! They do have different skin features, just like we do, that you can use to identifyindividuals and I also think that they have personality, that some are naturally more relaxedthan others. Depending on what you're wanting to do with them, you know, a relaxedhagfish can be a good hagfish. [laughs]Alie: [laughs] I wonder if the other hagfish are like, “Why does he always get picked?” and he'slike, “I don't know man. I'm just cool to kick it with.” [both laugh]Aside: Just an update, my new life motto is: [Tim’s voice with a radio style filter] ‘A relaxedhagfish can be a good hagfish.’ Also, Tim says hagfish DO have a reason to be uptight -scientists aren’t sure what effect overfishing or rising ocean temperatures will have on theirpopulations. Plastic is, of course, another issue. Tim says we all know it’s on the surfaces ofthe ocean, but he wonders where it’s ending up in the deep sea as well, and what organismsare ingesting it, and what that'll mean for the future of the hagfish. He’s about to embark onan expedition to the Galapagos. He’s great at trapping and is tinkering with new observationcameras to deploy. Folks on his research team refer to him as the hagfish wrangler.Alie: How deep are you able to do research?Tim: I think a lot of the limitations are because… Say if we're dropping traps, you typically willhave a rope that has to go the whole depth, if you're in 4,000 feet, you need such a hugeamount of rope to get down there that it limits how many traps you can have down at once.We're experimenting with some lineless trapping methods that actually use corrodible linksthat are made of magnesium, that corrode in seawater at a known rate, so that you can droptraps and our camera equipment into, say, like 6,000 feet of water and have them float backto the surface once the link corrodes. There are some really unique deep-sea technologiesthat are making this stuff possible now that maybe wasn't ten to twenty years ago. This is alla start. It’s just ramping up! [laughs]Alie: Yeah, such an exciting field of research, I feel like so many eyes are on hagfish, to be like,“What is happening with hagfish? Where is the slime coming from? How have they lived forso long?”Aside: Quick check in; I searched ‘hagfish myths’ and I did see that Google auto-filled withthe most frequent questions asked which included: “Are hagfish poisonous?” WHAT? No.“Can a hagfish bite a human?” No, they don’t even have a jaw! However, if you wound up onthe ocean floor, not alive, it might smell you, find you, munch you, poop you, spread you. Butat that point you would have bigger problems than the hagfish. 14Now, I kept searching for more flimflam and found that in Korea, hagfish is an aphrodisiacand a fertility food; its shape might have something to do with that. I also came upon aSmithsonian article that said, “According to common hagfish mythology, they can fill a 5-gallon bucket with the stuff in mere minutes,” and that is a myth! Because, people, it takesSECONDS and it would be a barrel!Alie: Is there any flimflam about hagfish that you would want to debunk? Any myths that you feelneed to [dismissive clicking sound with mouth]?Tim: Oh, hagfish myths? You should throw in my way. What have you heard? What are they upto?Alie: Oh, I haven't heard… I haven't heard a lot of faulty gossip about hagfish.Tim: Yeah. [laughs]Alie: Maybe, I mean, they're opportunists – that's the beauty of them – but do you think peopleare grossed out by them because of the m* [ding] factor?Tim: Oh, I think so, yeah. I would say that really grosses people out, but the reality is like the m*[ding] and the slime itself is not sticky. It's not toxic. It's actually really fun to play with.Alie: It is! I would say that.Tim: You know, I would challenge anyone to meet a hagfish, and to see their slime, and not be asintrigued as I am. Right? You are sometimes literally left speechless and in wonder.Alie: Yes! Have you ever seen any hagfish in a movie or a TV show?Tim: I think there have been some hagfish cartoons. There was a band called Hagfish! It was likea punk band called Hagfish.Alie: Really?! What'd you think of ‘em?Tim: I've never listened to them… I should! [laughs]Alie: It’s gonna to come up on their Google alerts, they are going to be like, “Oh man, that's aboutthe fish again.”Tim: [laughs] Yeah.Aside: The band Hagfish emerged in 1991, broke up in 2001 and had an energetic neopunk style descended from the Descendants. Now, one of their most revered studio albumsis called Rocks Your Lame Ass, and according to music journalist Trixie Delight, their nameitself means nothing to the band personally, it was simply chosen randomly from adictionary. [clip of the band, Hagfish]P.S. They wore suits and had sideburns and opened for Reverend Horton Heat and made afew other albums. So, Hagfish kinda made it big. But how big can hagfish make it?Tim: You know, we're already seeing, some of these hagfish are four to six feet long, others areabsolutely tiny, 10 centimeters. I’m sorry, I keep jumping between the two systems.Alie: [laughs] But we just don’t know how old they get?Tim: No.15Alie: Because nothing calcifies, there’s nothing to… [gasps] They’re such a mystery.Tim: That's one of those things, a lot of fish are indeterminate growers. They technically have thepotential to grow forever. In the deep sea, especially with such a strong defense mechanismlike the slime that they have, yeah, they could live decades! They could live over a hundredyears. Who knows?Alie: Wow, they’re such a quiet badasses. [rock guitar riff] That's what I love about them, they'rejust like, “Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to mess with me?” It’s just like, “Daaamn, hagfish!”Alie: Can ask you Patreon questions? Oh my gosh. I got a lot of questions from listeners.Tim: Yeah, for sure. That's good!Aside: Okay so before we get to Patreon questions, a few words from sponsors of theshow. They make it possible for me to give a donation each week to a charity of the ologist’schoosing. This week, Tim asked that it go to his Canadian woodsy science home away fromhome, The Wildlife Research Station. Since its inception in 1944, the Wildlife ResearchStation has been providing access and logistical support for University and governmentresearchers. It’s situated on Lake Sasajewun in Algonquin Provincial Park and operates as anon-for-profit organization. It has been instrumental in these really uniquely long-runningresearch projects on wildlife, from flies, to small mammals, turtles, birds, and more. A link tothat nonprofit will be in the show notes and up at AlieWard.com/Ologies/Hagfishology.Aside: This first question was also asked by patron Shea Goddard.Alie: Sydney Brown wants to know: Where did hagfish get their name, and what’s the biggesthagfish ever found?Tim: That’s a good question. In terms of the word hagfish, I’m not sure, but obviously if I were totake a more of a random guess at it, it has something to do with their looks. I'm just going togo ahead and guess.Aside: Side note patron Carla Kennedy asked: Are we sure they were supposed to benamed “hag” and not “gag” fish?? Typos happen. Shrug emoji.Wow. Wow Carla. Where is the respect for a slimy jawless sausage with a tiny dickmustache?I’m sorry I made everyone wait this far to hear the etymology of hagfish but, okay: The termwas first recorded in 1611 and is just comes from their face. Because they thought theywere not cute. Sometimes the most obvious answer is, insultingly, the right one. But, thoughnow hag technically means ‘a repulsive old woman’ according to the dictionary, that word isderived from the word for witch, which, given the magic spell it can cast in the form of aphlegm net, isn’t so off-base. And the reason why that word meant ‘witch’, that became theword hag, is because it came from a term for a hedge rider, as in, a supernatural womanwho rode the hedges between the safe, normal village and the wild outer lands.So, hagfish: spellbinding, rule breaking, living in the darkness, and making alchemy of awhale carcass and turning into magic nutrient poo. Now, on the topic of kalology and howwomen are judged by toxic beauty standards, a few people including Amber and JonathanMeade as well as Kelsie Libbu, Francina Martinez, Megan Metcalf, Jessica Beard, Amanda 16Blackburn, Hannah Lise, Kimberly Fajardo, Katie Kelly-Hankin, Dominika Dec, and TrentHoppe, asked this next one.Alie: Amber and Jonathan Meade want to know: Are there any medical or cosmetic uses forhagfish slime?Tim: I think there's definitely an interest in the cosmetic field, as well as in the medical field, inthe sense that it could maybe be used as a biological filter. If it blocks the flow of water andtraps water, you can maybe use it as an actual filter material. There's interest in using it as afood product as well, as an egg replacement. I've seen hagfish slime itself turn up in recipes.I think that there's… People, for a long time have been looking to use it for different things. Ithink partially what's limited it is the availability of hagfish. They're just not super commonon land. [laughs]As well, it's difficult to store the slime, so the way that the hagfish stores it inside of theirglands is not really well understood. We know the chemicals that are there, we know (sortof) the environmental conditions inside the gland, but how they function is not really wellknown, and we've had a hard time replicating it. I think that's another one of the challengesto mainstream use of hagfish material, is that you need to be able to maintain its reallycharismatic properties over time. [“You’re one of the most charismatic people I’ve ever met!”]We see that its reactivity to sea water, the rate at which it responds, and everythingchanges as we store it.Alie: What happens if you have a mason jar full of hagfish slime?Tim: It eventually, if it's in water, will collapse. The network does collapse down and it essentiallywill somewhat dissolve away. The m* [ding] component is dissolvable, but we've neverfollowed it over really long periods, like days or weeks. Typically for most of our work we'reinterested in the really short timescale stuff. If we were to use hagfish slime for medicalpurposes, or cosmetic, or anything, we need to either figure out how to replicate it or how tostore it in really meaningful ways.Alie: I feel like if you had a sheet mask that was just hagfish slime, that would be hydrating ashell. Can you imagine? Just get a hagfish to lay on your face. I mean, that's essentially what asheet mask is.Cullen Elijah wants to know: Where do they fall in the food chain? Do other animals want toeven eat something that slimy? If you're a mammal, a sea mammal, you can chomp on it, butwhere do they fall in the food chain?Tim: I wouldn't say that they form the bottom of the food chain, but I wouldn't say that they'renecessarily the top either. There’s a lot of really active predators, even in the deep. There'sbig, active, shark species, there's big fish species that would probably be the dominantpredator down there. They have such a strong defense mechanism… which could also beviewed as sort of a competitive thing. As they're feeding at a carcass they do release bits ofslime. That has sort of been one of my ideas too: Whether or not they actually use it tocompete around a carcass. Hagfish can all deal with the slime, but nothing else can. Now, interms of where they fall; they are preyed upon, but they’re also a predator, so I think they’regoing to be somewhere in the middle, in terms of the zones of animals out there. 17Alie: Ooh. I love that they're like, “Hagfish party only.”Aside: Okay so Chris Brewer asked this next one, but so did Jack, Amanda Nyren, LaniBouwer, Sonya Karpelevitch, Bonnie Joyce, Amelia Blakeman, Kitti Halverson, VaughnSvendsen, Zoe Jane, Hayley Everson, Erik Pohanka, Danni Q and Shellina all asked someform of this hungry question.Alie: Chris Brewer wants to know: Will hagfish sushi ever trend?Tim: Ooh, well hagfish are eaten in Korea and probably elsewhere and Southeast Asia. They'rebarbecued, typically.Alie: Okay. Have you ever eaten it?Tim: I have never eaten it. I think the more time you spend with stuff, the more you sense itsdistinct smell and the more that it would probably taste like the smell. [laughs]Alie: Erik Pohanka wants to know: Have you ever tried eating their slime?Tim: No, but I know people have and that it is a part of recipes as an egg replacement. But again, Idon't think the slime would taste like much. It probably tastes like seawater.Alie: Does it do the same thing in freshwater?Tim: Less vigorously.Alie: Really? So, what is it about the salinity that activates those threads?Tim: Well, that's one of the things that we're trying to figure out, like, whether it's activeexchanges that go on with ions associated with the m* [ding] or the threads, whether it's atemperature-related thing, like the slime tends to set up better in cold water than warmwater. It's a fairly complex problem, I guess. We've been going at it from a lot of differentangles and we have a fairly good idea of the parameters that result in good slime formation,but the actual chemical basis for it all is still out there.Alie: Which is so exciting! Is it exciting to be at the forefront of this research?Tim: It’s super interesting. Everything we do day-to-day, for the most part, has never been done,so that gets me excited.Aside: Heads up, spoiler alert! This next question may deal with non-Newtonian fluids, soI thought I’d drop a def here now. I’m going to read this part right off of Wikipedia, because Ididn’t want to get it wrong:A non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid that does not follow Newton's law of viscosity. In nonNewtonian fluids, viscosity can change when under force, to be either more liquid or it can bemore solid.So ketchup, for example, becomes runnier when it’s shaken, thus ketchup is a nonNewtonian fluid. I just learned that right now! It also says custard, honey, toothpaste, paint,blood, and shampoo are all non-Newtonian fluids. It all sounds just like a delicioussmoothie. Just toss ‘em all in a blender.Alie: Sarah wants to know: Is hagfish slime a solid or liquid? Is it a non-Newtonian fluid? 18Tim: It is a non-Newtonian fluid. So, hagfish slime does have solid components to it, but becauseit essentially… We call it viscous entrapment; hagfish slime doesn't bind to water at all, itessentially creates channels that are really narrow, that work on the surface tension ofwater to trap it and slow its flow. It essentially slows water flow to a point that it creates theslime, but if you hold that slime out of water, all that water will drip out eventually andyou'll be left with nothing but a bit of m* [ding] and fiber.Alie: Oh my gosh. So, it's kind of like a really good net for water?Tim: Exactly. Which is sort of why earlier I said it'd be interesting to apply it to something like anoil spill and see how it worked at mopping up the water with the oil component in it.Alie: Oh my gosh, that's so fascinating! Lara Taffer wants to know: Do hagfish have any closerelatives to any land animals?Tim: Land animals? I don't think so. Their closest relative that still living is the lamprey. They’resort of grouped together with hagfish because they’re a jawless creature, they have aprimitive eel-like body, but I think the jury's out about whether or not hagfish actuallystarted out much more vertebrate-like, and then lost those vertebrate-like features, so thatwhat we're seeing is essentially something that was more complex that was actuallysomewhat simplified in time.Alie: They may have just gone on back? That's fascinating. Suki Hawley wants to know: Sincehagfish are creatures of the deep, do they get the bends when scientists bring them up to thelab to study?Tim: It's a super good question. A lot of fish have what's called an air bladder, which actually fillswith air to provide buoyancy for them, so they can fill it and empty it to adjust where theyare in the water column. Hagfish don't have an air bladder, so when we bring them up,they're actually totally fine. It’s a good question, because most fish that you would bring upfrom that depth are dead by the time they hit the surface because their swim bladderactually ruptures and causes severe damage to the fish itself. Hagfish don't have thatproblem, which is one of the reasons we can even study them. Hagfish seemingly have noproblem coming to ambient pressure at the surface.Alie: There's such slimy bad asses. I'm voting for Hagfish for president, is that weird? [Timlaughs] I'm so in awe of them. I feel like hagfish is gonna absolutely save the world. Okay.I'm going to ask one more question from a patron and then we'll wrap up. Travis DeMellowants to know: What are their social lives like? Do they relate to one another, and where dothey sleep?Tim: I think that's another great question. I think hagfish have very vibrant social life. [“I got lotsof friends.”] We see them living in burrows together, we don't know about their relationshipto each other, but they seem to like to pack together. They do like to be together incongregations. Where you find one hagfish, you find more. Whether or not that has to dowith the environment being really conducive to hagfish, or whether or not they actuallyseek out a social group, we don't know.We're actually working on at least filming them in captivity to better understand how theyinteract with each other over the days and weeks of circling around these tanks, and with 19very limited hiding spots. We provide them with habitat to hide in, but we're interested inhow they compete for that habitat. Like, are there dominant hagfish and subordinatehagfish? Or are they sort of devoid of that altogether, which is also a possibility, that thewhole competition that we see in a lot of other animals may be such an energy waster for ahagfish that they just don't do it.Alie: Aww! Just, maybe they don't care?Tim: Yeah. Maybe hagfish are friendly. [laughs]Alie: Is there a need for more hagfishologists?Tim: I think there is a need for a lot more people to study what’s happening in the oceans. Inmany ways, Antarctica and Space are these like crazy frontiers... I think the deep ocean isone of the last unexplored frontiers on the planet. A lot of these missions that have gonedown to video find new species. Almost every time they deploy these ROVs or deep-seasubmersibles, they find new species.I know that we get very excited when undergraduates come into the lab and we get tointroduce them to hagfish and spread the wonder, for sure. But I think that it is one of thosethings that… Most biologists that ever come across them are permanently interested. Theynever lose their interest. And we’ve seen this with the people that are now in their 90s thatlove talking hagfish because they maybe worked with them for one year, decades anddecades and decades ago, but it was when the most interesting things they ever did.Alie: You just get caught in a slimy web of love for hagfish.Tim: [laughing] All of the puns. Yeah.Alie: I always ask this at the very end; is there something about your job that sucks? Somethingthat frustrates you? What's the worst part about your job or hagfish?Tim: I think… Nothing wrong with the hagfish, but I think in terms of science in general, there's alot of failure. When you're doing projects, you're doing experiments in science, you neverknow what's right. You'll only ever find out what's likely wrong. I think that would be themost frustrating thing, is that you have to have pretty thick skin, in a way, to deal with it.Especially going up against questions or developing experiments and apparatus that havemaybe never been used or designed before. There's no Hagfish 101 book that we can turnto, to figure some stuff out. There's a good body of literature on hagfish. We do have whatwe consider the Hagfish Bible, it's called the Biology of Hagfish, and there's been, I think,three iterations of it now.Alie: Do you have a copy in your glove compartment, one at home, one at work? [laughs]Tim: Oh yeah, I've got one here for you. [laughs]Alie: The pocket guide to hagfish…Aside: I texted Tim later and asked, “What was the Hagfish bible?” and he said there aretwo: The Biology of Hagfish and Hagfish Biology. I hope the authors are friends.Tim: I’d say that’s it, but I think that's part of the fun too. I'd say the primary frustration is alsothe primary driver. [laughs]20Alie: What is your favorite thing about your job? What's your favorite thing about hagfish, oryour job, or what you do?Tim: I think that it’s discovery. I think it's like you were saying earlier, it's being on the forefrontof something. It's literally looking into the abyss. Like, how did natural selection act uponthis? What does this mean in terms of how hagfish relate to each other? How did they relateto vertebrates and other fish? And I think that that's something that just keeps us endlesslyintrigued because there are more unanswered questions than answered questions, and Ithink that's good for any scientific field. You want to think you have a good idea of what'sgoing on, but the more you know, the more you know you don't know. Right? I think that's agood problem that scientists have.Alie: And so that keeps you going a lot?Tim: Oh yeah. For sure.Alie: Oh, great. Thank you so much for doing this, I’m just so charmed by hagfish.Tim: Thank you, that's awesome. [laughs]It’s green tea, which is delicious and satisfying as is, and does not want or need to havemint, or jasmine, or tropical, or blueberry pomegranate essence thrown in, thank you very much.Alie Ward. Back with another episode of Ologies.So, this episode is exciting for a whole hamperful of reasons, one being that it was recordedremotely. Now, I just announced on Patreon, this coming week, I’ll be in Kansas City, Nebraska,South Dakota, North Dakota, Minneapolis, and Wisconsin. I'm gathering up, I think, 11 face-to-faceinterviews with ologists over 6 days. This Ologist was in Florida and I’ve been wanting to interviewher for a while, and I'm not going to make it to Florida so we just tried a remote tactic. So, if theaudio is any different than you’re used to, it is just me figuring out the nitty gritty of an LDR: LongDistance Recording. It's an amazing interview.Before we get to it, thank you to all the folks on Patreon. I would not be going on this Midwest roadtrip were it not for y’all. It’s been my goal since the start of the podcast in 2017. I’m interviewingpeople who have been on my spreadsheet for actual years.Also, thank you to anyone out there wearing Ologies merch, making new friends in the wild, and ofcourse all of the raters and the subscribers and reviewers. You know I read each one so that I canpick a freshie to highlight.This week it’s evrst18, I think, there's no vowels in that, who says,Every time I see an episode, for example, Hagfishology, and think, “Eh, I don't know howinteresting this will be,” I start playing the episode and it's amazing, super interesting, and oneof my favorites. Now I'm like, “Hagfish. Yes. Wow.” Make your life and the world better bylistening to Ologies and becoming another loyal child of Dad Ward.Thank you my tiny being. I pat you on the head.Okay. Addictionology. Yes, yes, yes. It’s a word, it’s a thing! The term has existed for years, but it wasonly in 2016 that the field of addiction medicine was formally recognized by the American Board ofMedical Specialties. It's an official subspecialty now. So, there’s a little trivia.This ologist is also an ologite. She's a listener of the podcast, and she had emailed me way, way backand I thought “What? Awesome!”This past Saturday we rigged a recording, both of us in weekend loungewear, and we talked shopabout her life and her work. You’ll hear about the ways our brains make us want things, and yourgrandpa’s casserole, and identifying what might be driving the need for a substance, how serioussubstance use disorders are, thoughts on the show, Intervention, some hope, some media tropesthat help, some that don't, the times she’s cried on the job, the lure of workahol and other nonsubstance addictions, and more. 2So, pull on something cozy and settle in for the experiences of Licensed Mental Health Counselorand a Master's level Certified Addictions professional, Addictionologist, Erin Parisi.----------Alie Ward: You are the first person on planet Earth to inform me that addictionology is a thing.Erin Parisi: It is a thing. Yes.Alie: When did you become aware of addictionology as a field?Erin: I knew that therapists treat people who have addictions, and I knew that there weredoctors that treated people who have addictions. I don't know that I ever really knew ofthe word until I started going to addiction treatment conferences. Probably, somebodythere used it the first time.When I look the term up, it says that it's professionals who study and treat addiction,which is certainly me, but I think it's probably used to reference medical doctors, andI'm a therapist. I come at it from the behavioral perspective.Alie: Do you feel like there's a divide where people think it's just behavioral, as opposed tomedical as well? Do we have a lot of different stigmas about it?Erin: Well, absolutely. There's a ton of stigmas about it. I think a lot of people think thataddiction is a choice.That's kind of an old school line of thinking. The more and more research that's done,the more we know that it's not really a choice. There's a lot that goes into it. It's not assimple as somebody choosing to drink a lot or do a lot of drugs. There's a wholebackground to it.I think both pieces are equally important. We need to be treating it like it's a disease or adisorder, not as though there's something just wrong with the person, that it's a choiceor that it's a spiritual deficiency.Alie: Right. It does seem like in the past, or still presently, that a lot of people just attribute itto a character flaw.Erin: Yes, that's absolutely true, which makes getting people into treatment even harder.Because who wants to admit they have an addiction problem and go to treatment ifdoing so means you have a character defect? It's pretty painful to look at yourself thatway.The more we look at it like a disorder or a medical disease, the easier it is for people toseek treatment, just like you would for other disorders or other diseases.Aside: Quick aside, there’ll be much more on addiction as a disease in a bit. Butfirst, how I came to know her work. 3Alie: You emailed me a while ago, and ...Erin: I did, I think after I heard the Ologiesology episode.Alie: Yes, I really, really wanted to do this topic for so long and I didn't know if it was anology. Your subject line in the email was Addiction. It doesn't have to be a bummer, I waslike, “Hey, I already love you!”Erin: I know like you don't always want to cover these super heavy topics, and addictioncertainly can be, but there's a lot of non-bummery things to it also. That's what keeps usin the field, I think. So, yeah.Alie: What got you into the field? What made you steer your ole career boat in this direction?Erin: I know a lot of people who work in addiction did not pick addiction on purpose. That isdefinitely true for me.Alie: Really?Erin: Yes, I fell into it just like so many other people do. I was at the end of my master'sdegree and I needed an internship and I was having a lot of difficulty getting aplacement that would also allow me to keep working while I interned.One of the programs that was more flexible and could work with me and work with mywork schedule was a program that was geared towards treating HIV positive clients,some of which did not have addictions, but some certainly did. That was really when Istarted working with people who had addiction.When I finished my internship and I graduated my master's program, I was offered a jobat a different part of the same organization, working primarily with addiction. I got intoit right away and I ended up really loving it. It's a good fit for my personality. It's a toughpopulation, but tremendously rewarding. I love it so much.Alie: Why do you think it is a good fit for your personality? As a kid, were you always kind ofinterested in people's mental health or were you interested in behavioral? What clickedfor you?Erin: Well, I always knew I wanted to go into psychology and that I wanted to be a therapist.Ever since I was really little, I have absolutely been interested in people. I definitelywanted to help people. I do not have the stomach for medical things. I can't do blood andguts and stuff. Doctoring was never going to be a part of my thing.Aside: Erin got her Bachelor’s in Psychology and a Master’s in Counseling atUniversity of Central Florida in Orlando. She's been practicing for nearly a decade,working at inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation centers. She conducts individual andgroup, and family therapy sessions, in everything from substance abuse to sexaddictions. She knows her stuff. But when she was just starting out...4Alie: Is it weird when you're studying psychology to not diagnose yourself with everything,or to diagnose everyone in your life with everything? How do you not do that?Erin: They tell you in school not to diagnose yourself and not to diagnose the people aroundyou, because as they're teaching you things, you start seeing it in everyone around you.Part of it is just the excitement of starting to learn things; some of it is maybe being alittle too overconfident in your abilities.They also recommend that you go see your own therapist and do some of your ownwork because it's really, really difficult to work with other people on their stuff if yourown stuff isn't taken care of. I think that's really helpful.Alie: Was there anything that you realize like, “Whoa shit, I have to unpack this” when youstarted going to school?Erin: Uh yeah! Of course.Alie: Do you get discounted sessions with people who are like, “I'm also in school. I need tounpack my stuff.” How do you do that?Erin: Yes, I think most therapists want to help other therapists. I think we try and do thingslike sliding fee scales, especially for students that we know are probably not making alot of money.One of the most jarring things that I realized while I was in graduate school still washow much addiction there was in my own family. I had just never seen it. In talkingabout it with one of my friends, I was like, “Oh shit.” I just never really saw it before.They think so many people have the expectation that alcoholics or drug addicts arealways homeless under a bridge. That's not the majority of people, so it's not as easy tospot all the time.Aside: I am going to run down some stats because addiction is common, it affectsall kinds of folks. I’m just going to lovingly toss some numbers at your beautiful faces,kind of like a tennis ball machine thingy, because this issue needs some context andbecause all of these numbers represent real people with real lives and real struggles andfamilies and friends who love them. Numberpalooza. Here we go.The 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that almost 20 millionpeople in America, over the age of 12, battled a substance use disorder. 20 million.It’s estimated that nearly 90,000 people die from alcohol-related causes each year inAmerica. Alcohol is the third-leading cause of preventable deaths in the US.Opioid overdose deaths were around 8,000 in 1999, but rose to 47,000 in 2017. That47,000 is well over the number of people lost in car crashes every year in America.4.1 million battled a marijuana use disorder in 2017. The majority of those people --between the ages of 12 and 25. 5Of the 2.3 million people in American prisons and jails, more than 65% meet the criteriafor addiction. In terms of homeless people who were dependent on alcohol, about 38%.The good news is that addiction is considered a highly treatable disease. About 10% ofpeople over 18 in the US that you met or know are in recovery from a substance abuseissue. 10%!The latest stats show that only about one fifth of the folks who need treatment, receivedtreatment. Imagine if only one fifth of the folks who have been diagnosed with canceractually got treatment of any kind. So, addictionology, pretty damn important.Addiction, pretty damn common. Also, pretty treatable with the right resources andsupport.Alie: How do you feel when you can see addiction in someone you know, but as someonewho's not treating that person, you can't intervene. What really is the protocol there?Erin: It's a tough line to walk, and sometimes I just kind of have to take a step back. It's reallyhard to have a front row seat to something bad that's happening, and not be able to doanything about it.Sometimes, just as a friend, I'll throw something out there like, “Hey, have you thoughtabout talking to somebody?” When people find out that I'm a therapist, a lot of timesthey overshare with me.Alie: Yeah.Erin: That happens a lot.Alie: [sarcastic] Can't imagine! [both laughing]Erin: The first interview I did with another therapist was a sex therapist, my very firstsemester in graduate school. He said, “If you're ever on an airplane, never tell the personnext to you that you're a therapist.” That was probably the best advice. [“So what do youdo?”]Alie: You mentioned that you realized maybe there was more addiction in your family thanpreviously you were aware of. What is addiction and why do you think that maybe wedon't always realize it if it's in front of us? What's the actual definition of addiction?Erin: Well, I did look up the definition of addiction before we got on this because I didn't wantto screw that one up. I went by ASAM's definition, which is the American Society ofAddiction Medicine. They would be a good place to get that from.Addiction is a primary chronic disease of brain reward, motivation memory, and relatedcircuitry. It all happens in the brain, not that that's really shocking. [“Shocker!”] 6Addiction is characterized by an inability to consistently abstain impairment problemswith one's behavior and interpersonal relationships and a dysfunctional emotionalresponse.That's a whole lot of verbiage there.Alie: Yeah.Erin: Lay person definition, I usually say something like something becomes so important toyou, that you're willing to sacrifice many other things in your life for it, which usuallyisn't noticed in people's lives until it progresses pretty far.I think that's what makes it hard to spot it, that it can happen on a spectrum. At one endyou do have the homeless under a bridge, that have their cliché brown paper bag with abottle in it. But not every alcoholic looks like that, right? It's a whole spectrum ithappens a little bit at a time. Even the very worst case of alcoholism or addiction youcan think of started with the very first drink or the very first time getting high, whenthings were not a problem yet.Alie: Addiction can be to what exactly? I know we're talking about drugs, we're talking aboutalcohol, but addiction can also be addictive behaviors and compulsions, I imagine. Whatare the more common addictions, and is there a really big gulf between chemicaladdiction and behavioral?Erin: Different people may have different answers on that one. I think when we talk aboutaddiction, most people picture alcohol or drugs and that is fitting, obviously, but thereare behavioral addictions, things like gambling, food, sex, hoarding even is on theaddictive spectrum. Right now, the only behavioral addiction that makes it into ourdiagnostic manual is gambling.Alie: Really? What's happening with the dopamine sprinkler system in the brain when westart getting addicted to something, or what neurotransmitters are involved? What littlesquirt guns full of brain juices happen. I'll look it up.Erin: I like some really dumbed down version of it because I don't know if you know this, butthe brain is super complex.Alie: Yeah, I heard about that! [both laughing]Erin: It's like kind of a big deal.I like to say even though they're both in the same place, my work is more with the mindthan with the physical brain.Aside: Let’s take a quick chemical detour in the not the magic school bus per se butmy cosmic 2007 Prius. Let's tour our own squishy, fun, well-meaning animal brains.7When something is noiiiiice, [“Noice!”] it tends to produce a nice little, kind of a mist ofhealthy dopamine in the brain. That's a neurotransmitter that makes us happy.Dopamine also helps with things like motor function and just fixing life problems.Dopamine can make us feel great from a bunch of stimuli. For me, I try to think of thingsthat would make me so happy and seeing a huge flying beetle – oh, I would be soexcited! Or getting fresh movie popcorn, or snorgling a puppy. The thing is, substances,though, can make us squirt out up to 10 times as much dopamine as just organicsituational every day happies.With the substance producing so much dopamine, your body’s like, “Oh. Fine. I guessyou don’t need me making you any. Hah.” Kind of like if your grandpa made you a prettylegit casserole that was your favorite, but you were like, “Sorry gramps, I filled up on DelTaco and I liked it more and I’m full now.” Your grandpa stops making you your favoritecasserole. Dopamine, we're talking about dopamine here.What I’m saying is that one way something becomes addictive is that dopamineresponses get disturbed. Early childhood neglect or trauma, or just genetics, canpredispose us to certain neurobiology that makes our brain come into the game withsome maybe less-than-ideal neurotransmitter situations.It can feel easier for some of us to self-medicate with substances that don't require adoctor or prescription but instead are just available at a party or a happy hour afterwork. Now, Erin also says that the human brain doesn’t stop developing until the mid20s, and the part of your brain that develops last, handles impulse control and decisionmaking.You literally don't have the part of your brain that will help you make good decisions,and then you're trying things that could impair the way your brain develops. This is howso-called gateway drugs can set someone up for a tougher road ahead, resisting moredangerous substances, like some of the patients Erin sees.Alie: For the clients that you see, how typically do they come into your care? Are they part ofan inpatient or outpatient program, and where do you start with them?Erin: Well, I used to work in a treatment facility that was residential. When I would startseeing clients there, a lot of times they had come in from a detox program, like theywent to detox first before coming to our programs. They'd already been in treatment fora little bit.Not every substance requires a medical detox. Some people would have come in withoutgoing to detox first.Alie: What happens in medical detox?Erin: Some drugs are dangerous to come off of. The most dangerous is alcohol.Alie: Really!?8Erin: Yeah. If you have a physical dependence on alcohol, then you should not try and weanyourself off of alcohol. That would be something that should be done with a doctor'ssupervision.Aside: Quick questions: What are some signals that you may have an alcoholdependence problem?A few clinical signs might be: More than once, gotten into situations while or afterconsuming alcohol that increased your chances of getting hurt, like swimming drunk,driving drunk, using machinery, walking in dangerous areas, having unsafe sex,continuing to drink alcohol even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious, orhaving a memory blackout.Maybe if you felt like you've had to drink much more than you once did to get the sameeffect, or worrying about where your next drink is coming from, or planning social,family or work events around alcohol. Some withdrawal symptoms from alcohol mightbe getting the ol’ shakes, sweating, nausea, depression, insomnia, irritability.The latest stats show that 17 million adults in the US have a diagnosable alcohol usedisorder. I just googled 17 million Americans to see what that was comparable to and Iguess 17 million Americans a day take ibuprofen, 17 million Americans did the ALS (ice)bucket challenge in 2014, and also 17 million is the number of Americans who call insick to work the day after the Superbowl, which might be more pertinent to the topic athand.So, beyond booze, what else does Erin help people with?Erin: Second most dangerous would be the family of medications, Benzodiazepines, likeXanax or Klonopin. I have a beef with the Benzo family of medications because they'represcribed, and there's so much focus on opiate prescription medications, likepainkillers, that I feel like Benzos go under the radar a lot of the time and really, theycan be very dangerous as well. As miserable, an experience as detoxing from opiates canbe, it's actually not dangerous.Alie: Oh, okay. So, it might be more painful.Erin: You will be miserable, and the joke is that you might want to die, but coming off ofheroin is probably not going to kill you.Alie: Oh, I didn't know that. Once they're through a medical detox, or if they skip that step,then they might come into your care.Erin: Yes. Medical detox, depending on the person's case, usually lasts five to seven days. Icould get on my soap box about what insurance will and will not pay for. That's a bigpart of the problem. 9Alie: Where do you start with behavioral modifications? Is there an aspect of 12 stepprogram in your treatment? How do you feel about those programs? Do you start withheavy journaling, reflection, little baby steps?Erin: You want to start working with the person wherever they're at. I try and be reallycareful not to call something an addiction until my client has used those words.Some people might be comfortable talking about like, “Okay, I drink too much,” but theydon't want to use the A word. You know, we're not going to call them an alcoholic, andthat's fine by me. It doesn't make that much difference to me.I am a supporter of the 12 step programs. I think they can be really helpful for a lot ofpeople. They are not right for everyone, but of course with my background, I'm not a fanof doing the 12 steps instead of therapy. I think doing 12 steps in addition to therapy canbe really helpful. There are so many AA meetings, you can find one almost any time youneed one. That's not true for therapy either. The benefits of AA are, there are tons, butobviously I'm partial to the therapy part. [both laugh]Alie: Do you start them with looking at the history that got them there, to try to figure outwhat the reward of the behavior or the chemical was? Do you try to really figure outwhat brought them back time and again, even despite the consequences?Erin: I do ask because I think it's important to get to know the person's individual history. Ithink most people put pressure on themselves and treatment to figure out “Why am Idoing this? What's the underlying reason?”That's not necessarily the key to getting better. The treatment doesn't necessarilychange depending on what the answer is. Most people who end up using a lot of drugsor alcohol have another underlying mental health thing, whether it's anxiety ordepression or bipolar or trauma or whatever else. Even if that didn't come first.A lot of people think, “If I'm depressed, I'll start using drugs or drinking to manage mydepression.” That's not true for everybody. Some people start drinking or using drugsfirst and end up with depression as a result.Aside: Getting started in recovery might first mean addressing some struggles withmedications, like anti-craving prescription or anti-depressants for mental healthdisorders that might be underlying. Also rats.Erin: Usually it's a combination of managing mental health, increasing things like copingskills, and support around them. There was a study done on rats that was talked aboutat a conference I went to that always stood out to me. They put a rat in a big cage andthey had rat park at one end of the cage, with all the rats, little rat friends. [“Oh, rats.Rats rats rats.”] At the other end of the cage, it had drugs. I think they were usingcocaine. They got the rat addicted to cocaine, and then dropped it in this cage where ratpark was at one end and cocaine was at the other end. The rat picked rat park!10Alie: Oh, that's wonderful. [snippet of Friends ending theme song]Erin: That tells me the power of a community. Many people who end up addicted tosomething, they really lost their community. When they come into treatment, one of thefirst things that is talked about – and this is true of AA – and of treatment, changingpeople, places and things.There's so much that's associated with drug and alcohol use in their life by that point,you look at getting rid of all of that. Can you imagine having to get rid of everyone thatyou care about? Having a rat park to turn to. We all need a rat park.Alie: That's the sweetest story about rats I've heard today! It's the only story I've heard aboutrats today, but it's also the sweetest.Aside: The researcher behind rat park, this experiment from the late 1970s, wasBruce K. Alexander, a Canadian. His website has delightful photos of sawdust beddedenclosures with trees painted on the walls, there's some empty tin cans to hide in, someexercise wheels. He writes,We ran several experiments comparing the drug consumption of rats in Rat Parkwith rats in solitary confinement. In virtually every experiment, the rats in solitaryconfinement consumed more drug solution, by every measure we could devise. Notjust a little more. A lot more.Now the rat park experiment has been re-done, and not all the of the data can bereplicated. I guess the use of opiates declined in both the solitary and the park rats, sothey weren’t sure if it was due to a different strain of rats.Another study showed that environmental enrichment, aka a sweet-ass rat pad in whichto kick it, reduced cocaine seeking behavior in mice, and that a nice environment caneliminate established addiction-related behaviors.As I sat here writing this alone in my apartment, I thought – maybe I should be in acoffee shop instead. With other little rats. That sounds fun.Erin also says that a lot of times with a substance abuse disorder, a person has lostfriends or given up hobbies, so one of the reasons she likes programs like AA is thatthere’s a healthier community aspect that may have been lacking during addiction. Ifany of this is sounding familiar, what does one do? Where does one start?Alie: What do you suggest for people who don't know if they have a problem, or if they don'tknow if someone in their life has a problem, and they're trying to evaluate if a line hasbeen crossed into something unhealthy?Erin: I think it's fair that if you're wondering if you yourself have a problem with something,it's probably worth talking to someone about.Alie: Yeah. 11Erin: Talk it out with somebody else, and again, assuming that addiction happens on aspectrum, if you're looking to make a change before things have gone very bad, it wouldbe easier to make a change earlier on.If you're questioning, “Maybe I should do this differently,” well maybe you should do itnow. Don't wait until you're checking off “Well, I don't have a job and I'm homelessunder a bridge. Maybe I should do something now.”It can be a lot tougher when you're trying to evaluate somebody else in your life becauseyou don't really have control over somebody else's addiction or treatment or whetheror not they're motivated to make a differenceAlie: How would you suggest people tackle addictions that they can't necessarily just go coldturkey on? If someone has an overeating addiction or a work addiction or somethingthat has to be part of their life?Erin: A lot of things that people get addicted to, you can't just give up cold turkey like drugs oralcohol. You don't need them to live. You're probably going to have to have a job. You'regoing to need to eat food. Sex is seen as a normal adult behavior, so it's likely you're notgoing to give that up totally either.It's important to look at what your problem behaviors are around things like work orsex or food or exercise or video games or whatever. Look at what limitations you can tryand put in place for you.Is eating chicken addictive? It's not usually like chicken and vegetables that areaddictive for people, it's bread and sugar. I overeat when I'm bingeing on sugar orbread, so maybe I need to focus on adding in more things like chicken or vegetables ornatural fruits, natural sugars.Around work, I need to be careful about my schedule and make sure I'm prioritizingtime outside of work. Not staying up all night on my passion project Alie Ward. [Erinlaughing]Alie: What? Huh? [female voice saying, “I feel very attacked!”] When it comes to addictions, doyou feel like you're seeing them change at all in the last like 10 years with the way thatwe work or the technology that we have at hand to keep our brains going?Erin: Yeah, it does seem like we're almost training ourselves to have shorter attention spans,with all of the stimulation we have on a day-to-day basis between our phones and ourlaptops and our tablets and our jobs are more demanding.Our bosses expect to be able to reach us, whether or not it's work hours. I think thatmakes it harder to tell when a problem is developing. How much of it is the expectationof you and of your behavior and how much is really driven by a problem.12Most people don't start thinking about it as a problem until something goes wrong.Sometimes that's a relationship and sometimes it's your health or you find yourselfunhappy and you start looking into why that might be.Alie: Yeah. How do you feel about, Intervention, the show or interventions in general? Do youfeel like it's exploitative of the people who are going through something or do you feellike it's illuminating for folks who maybe don't recognize they have a problem? How doyou feel about how addiction is seen in pop culture?Erin: I have a lot of opinions on that.Alie: Yeah. Bring it on.Erin: I like the show Intervention. My favorite part is always the meeting with the family.[“Your addiction has made me feel miserable, abandoned, confused and depressed.”]because the family has a lot to do with whether or not the person will succeed. Noteverything to do with it, but a lot of times the people that are closest to someone with adrug or alcohol problem they keep the problem going whether or not they want towrite. No one wants to think that way of themselves, that maybe they're doingsomething to contribute, but a lot of people do unintentionally.For the person that's identified as having a drug or alcohol problem to change, theirfamily system needs to change too. Sometimes that means cutting them off from money,or support, or not enabling things anymore.A lot of families protect their loved ones from the consequences of their actions; bailingthem out of jail when they get arrested, paying for fancy rehab after fancy rehab. Noteveryone learns that way when their loved ones are protecting them from theconsequences. A lot of people do need consequences.Alie: What about the way that we see addicted characters in TV or movies? How do you feelabout it?Erin: I don't like when drug use gets really glamorized in TVs and movies because they thinkit encourages the viewpoint that a lot of things are not a big deal. They're not a big dealfor everybody, but they are a big deal for other people.Aside: Erin says that when kids, or even grown-ups, see folks in the media dabblingin drugs and alcohol but being just a-okay by the time they role the credits, it gives afalse sense that everything will be fine.Erin: Plus, I also wish there were more good references to people who were in sustainedrecovery and doing well. I feel like the only time we see addiction in TV or movies iswhen people are at the worst part of their illness, which I think lends itself to the beliefthat people don't get better. Once they get better, you don't see the addiction anymore.Really, people do get better. They get into long term recovery and they stay clean andsober and then they're not as visible. 13Aside: Okay, so addiction as an illness. Let’s get into it.Erin: Sometimes people ask why it matters if we consider addiction as a disease and by itbeing classified as a disease, insurance companies will pay for treatment, or else there'dbe no treatment options for people.Alie: Wow.Erin: That means research dollars will go into it, and medication to help is out there andthere's less blame on the person who's sick if we look at it as a disease of the person,that there's something wrong with a person. People don't get help. They just walkaround thinking that there are pieces of shit and most of them do already.One of the things I say when people say things like, “Well, you're just letting them off thehook. You're just, you're giving them a free pass.” That it's not their fault that they endedup addicted, but it is their responsibility. Just like any other disease would be yourresponsibility to manage, but not necessarily your fault.Alie: Right, right. Oh, that’s so important.Erin: It's important to treat people with compassion.Alie: To also treat them medically in general.Erin: Right. The advances that are coming out are just incredible, and there are things likeMethadone and Suboxone and anti-craving medications.The more we see it as a disease and the more we acknowledge that it needs to betreated like one, the more help there will be.Aside: Historically, alcohol dependence was described as a disease as early as thelate 1700's. I don't even know if they had soap back then. AA was founded in the 1930s,and then modern addiction medicine really emerged in the 1950s. From a terminologystandpoint, dependence refers to the physical dependence on a substance, and addictionis the combination of the physical dependence and the change in behaviors associatedwith that. In general, “substance use disorder” is more scientific and sometimespreferred. Also, words like “addict”, “abuser”, “user” and even saying someone is now“clean” imply a bunch of value judgements and can really stigmatize the medical diseasethat is dependence and addiction. So, just consider this a little addictionary to help. Getit? Addictionary. [Price is Right loser horns at the silly pun]Erin: The other piece of it is, is that when you see it as a choice, the interventions are nottreatment like we have now. It's prison and church.Alie: Right. 14Erin: We need to punish the addiction out of people or use church to make them good peopleagain. While those things can be tools for sure, it shouldn't be in place of appropriatemental health and healthcare.Alie: On that note, do you ever have any guidance for anyone who might be squeamish abouta recovering program because of the mention of God and higher powers, if that's ever adeterrent for someone going?Erin: It's really about finding what works for you. If you would like a spiritually basedprogram, those exist. If you would like a program that is not, those also exist.Alie: Yeah.Erin: I also encourage people to be as open minded as they can be because you never know.Alie: Yeah. I've heard people will substitute the higher power, instead of thinking of a higherpower thinking of a purpose. When they hear the word higher power, maybe guidingthem, think of what is my purpose that's guiding me?Erin: Yeah.Alie: If it's creeping them out to think of a religious puppeteer that's like, “Ah, I'm here.” Youknow what I mean? Which as someone who was raised Catholic, who is very much notCatholic, I don't like the of some white robed old guy looking over me being, like, “Arghar argh.”Erin: Watching your every move.Alie: I'm like, “Nah.” I think that recovery programs made me a little bit squeamish, butsomeone once told me, “Think of that as a purpose not a person.”Erin: It really just needs to be something bigger than you that ties into a purpose too. If youbelieve that you're here for a reason or that everything happens for a reason or whatgoes around comes around or Karma or whatever, that can help you in your day-to-daydecision making.Alie: The term self-care is bandied about, and now it means sheet masks and Netflix. What istrue self care to make sure that you're not going off the rails or slipping into a copingmechanism that isn't healthy. What is self-care and versus what is indulgence, and whatis necessary?Erin: I think it's important to make sure your basics are covered because it's really hard to doanything extra if your basic needs aren't being met. Doing things like making sure you'reeating, that you're eating pretty well, that you're eating enough. Everything withinreason, balance, getting enough sleep but not too much. Getting in some activities, somesocializing. Making sure that all of your needs are being met – again, within reason – isreally important. If you're not doing those things, then anything else you're doing isgoing to be a struggle. If you look at things in terms of balance, that's really helpful. 15One of the things we would say in rehab or in group is,We're not always reinventing the wheel, but somewhere along the line, the way weforgot about those things -- even things like making sure you're showering -- it'sreally hard to feel good about yourself if you're not reasonably clean.Alie: Oh yeah.Erin: How do you get good self-esteem when you think maybe you're a little funky? Or thatyour sheets haven't been washed in a month or whatever. Self-care can be things likewashing your sheets, doing your laundry, taking an extra-long bath and adding things toyour daily routine that you enjoy.Alie: What about people who are struggling financially? Do you ever see that there's acorrelation between being just really broke and freaking out and coping with asubstance?Erin: Sure. I don't know which came first in that scenario, but like one of the things I usuallypoint out is “How much do you think you're spending on alcohol?” It's not cheap if youdevelop any sort of habit.I have said to people, “You could afford therapy with the money you're spending onalcohol every month.”Alie: Right. Oh my God, a bar tab is not cheap. For sure.Erin: No.Aside: Okay of course I looked it up, and the average bar tab is between $70-$90 inmetropolitan cities. If that seems steep, please feel free to visit LA and peruse ourbespoke hand-crafted cocktails menus. $16 plus tax and tip. Oh, you want a sparklingwater? Great, that’ll be $6.Erin says to look at a bar tab in terms of how many therapy session copays that wouldbe! Also, is now a good time to mention that a DUI costs around $15,000? That’s somuch therapy instead. You could also rescue a poodle for that, and have a lot of moneyto spare. [“Dollar, dollar bills y'all”]Alie: Is there a good resource for people who don't have a lot of money or don't haveinsurance to seeking some therapy or some help?Erin: When you look for a therapist online, a lot of therapists on their website will saywhether or not they offer a sliding fee scale, which just means they're willing to adjusttheir rates if you're not able to afford the full fee. So, that's a good resource.A lot of counseling programs in universities will offer either free or low-cost therapy tothe community because their students need people to practice on, and they are heavilysupervised. You're not just getting one therapist, you're getting a couple. 16Aside: There’s also a non-profit called openpathcollective.org, which is a databaseof therapists nationwide who say they are dedicated to ending economic disparity in themental health field, which is awesome.It’s $50 to join, and then they offer low-cost sliding-scale fees. If you drive a Tesla andare looking to save a couple bucks on therapy, they do say, in effect, “Can you not?” Ifyou can, use your health insurance or pay full price, you can check out their sister site,which is Being Seen, to find a therapist.OpenPathCollective.org, for folks who can afford it, it's such a nice site. You can put inyour zip code, and a bunch of therapists nearby pop up, with little pictures, and astatement from each of them, and their specialties. Instead of just choosing someonerandomly, you can like, pick the nice lady with a cat on her lap, or the man with the kindeyes.Again, that's OpenPathCollective.org and if you have insurance and just need to find agood therapist, you can try Being Seen.Erin: I don't want people to feel like they're the only one because it's so, so, so common.Alie: Does it ever annoy you when people throw around the term addiction willy nilly, or is itjust a common parlance? If someone just can't stop eating these tortilla chips, are theyreally addicted or are you like, “Come on?” [Erin laughing]Erin: No, it doesn't bother me ... too much. Sometimes I'll follow it up with a joke that like onlyI think is funny, like, “Time to get you into a tortilla chip recovery program,” [ba-dumTSHH!!], and then I just realized what a dork I am. [both laughing]Alie: Does it ever bother you when people say addicting versus addictive grammatically?Erin: No, that one doesn't, but it does bother me when people say they just have an addictivepersonality.Alie: Oh!Erin: I'm like, “No, you don't!”Alie: Is there such a thing?Erin: Not clinically, but there are people who are predisposed to addiction and it's true thatonce you're addicted to one thing, you're more likely to have a problem with addictionto other things. So, if you are an alcoholic, can you just switch to another substance andbe fine? Probably not.Same is true with the behavioral stuff we were talking about. A lot of people get intorecovery for drugs or alcohol, but then find out that they become addicted to otherbehaviors like sex or video games or whatever. Workahol.17Alie: Workahol, which is great substance. When you trade in one for the other, what'sbeneath that is whatever maybe underlying, anxiety or depression or coping mechanismthat isn't being satisfied. It's really whatever you're ignoring is getting filled with theaddiction?Erin: Well, it's also that reward circuitry of the brain, because if a little bit makes me feelgood, then I want a lot. Some of our brains are just kind of built that way.Aside: Studies – including some with twins – have shown that heritability for asubstance use disorder is about 50%, and in adolescence the social pressure and peergroup has a greater effect than the genetic predisposition. The peer pressure factor,kind of like butts and memories, declines with age.Erin says that substance of choice tends to run in families, and that may be due to theheritability of underlying mental disorders that go undiagnosed and untreated and thenthey are left to self-medication. Think undiagnosed ADHD in family members whochoose stimulants or heritable anxiety and the inclination to use downers.Contributing factors might be peer groups, genetics, early childhood trauma and neglect,as I mentioned earlier, can also play a role. One study showed that in rhesus monkeys, ifthey were deprived of soothing contact as babies they had higher stress responses, lessbehavioral control and, turned out, an increased appetite for alcohol.This is not just limited to little lab monkeys, of course. Erin told me that on Sundaymornings, she volunteers at a local hospital, cuddling human babies. This is, indeed, athing. In the neonatal intensive care unit, the parents can't always be there to sootheand cradle their little teeny tiny ones, so volunteers are on board to just come and holdthe bebehs and rock them to sleep and just be a big warm thing hugging them.If you think you just found your new volunteer cause or maybe you think I’m lying, justgoogle “baby cuddlers” and your local hospital. They may need you desperately, or theremay be a wait list to volunteer. Depends on the city.Some of the kiddos may have neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) — which is opioidwithdrawal that is inherited from their mothers. In one article I read, an Army veterannamed Doug, and he explained that,You can tell when kids cry because they’re mad, or they’re hungry, but babies withNAS, it’s a very sad cry,” he said. “It’s just sad, because they don’t understand what’shappening, and they don’t understand why things hurt. They just don’t understand.Doctors and nurses report that the more cuddling these babes get, the less medicationthey tend to require in the NICU. So, if you would like to help prevent some futuresubstance-use disorders, it might start by rocking a teeny little human who needs you.Also: those teeny toes! Huh!Volunteering: it can be so wonderfully selfish. 18Alie: Do you have any patients that have had a recovery that's really made you feel veryinspired or made you ugly cry at work or anything?Erin: Oh my God, yes. I ugly cry.Alie: Really?Erin: I try not to ugly cry at work [girl's voice “It's not funny, get out of here!”]. I cry a lot ofhappy tears.That's one of the flim flam things I had written down because I knew that was going tocome, that people don't recover. Oh my gosh. People absolutely do recover, and it is adeadly disease and it affects so many people, but people do also get better.I see them at the worst point in their life. They'll come back later on just to say hi andshow me how well they're doing. They'd be like, “Look, this is how far I have in myrecovery!” It just gets me crying that they were potentially near death and miserableand they thought things couldn't get any better, and they'll have changed their wholelife.Sometimes they'll come back and they'll have kids or be married and they would be like,“I'm so happy.” It just like makes me so happy. That's why I get into it. It makes all thedifference.This disease kills people, it progresses. To see someone come back from death’s breach,it's incredible.Alie: You're making me cry now! [both laughing]Erin: I think it's so wonderful. It's so amazing. To look back and see the progress somebodymade over a span of time, they may not always realize like, and they'll be really hard onthemselves. Like, “I should have this, I should have that. I've been clean or sober for thisamount of time and I should be further along.” But looking back, you can see how muchprogress. People who are so down, they don't smile anymore, and then their face lightsup over something ridiculous and you're like, “Oh my God, you're really laughing.” [bothlaughing] It's a beautiful thing.Alie: Does that ever inspire you in your own life to do things or tackle things that youotherwise would put off?Erin: Yeah, a lot of my clients inspire me. They are facing tough things, and really all peopleare facing tough things. Nobody has it easy. A lot of times I can think, so many peopleare tackling so many hard things. I can go do a thing.Alie: Yeah!Erin: Why not? Why not go do the thing? [both laughing]Alie: Right.19Erin: Fuck it.Alie: You can clean out your pantry. People quit heroin. No, you can do a couch to 5k. There'ssomeone out there going to change their whole life.Aside: Before your Patreon questions, a few quick words about things I like fromsponsors who make the show possible and who make it possible for us to make adonation to a cause of the ologists’s choosing. This week, Erin wanted to support moreresearch on the health aspects of substance use disorders, so a donation is going toNIDA; the National Institute on Drug Abuse. They have a gift fund.Also, Erin mentioned that a lot of folks struggling with addiction may have been victimsof trauma, so at her behest, the donation is split between NIDA and End the Backlog,which helps to shine a light on the backlog of untested rape kits nationwide. Thesedonations made possible by a few sponsors.Alie: Jon Tillman wants to know: Why is addiction sometimes referred to as a disease, oroftentimes maybe?Erin: Because it is.Alie: Boom. [“Nailed it”]Erin: Because that's the best example we can use to teach people about it. Cause we're tryingto get away from the choice model, that something is just wrong with the person as ahuman being. When really, nobody wants to become a drug addict or an alcoholic.Nobody's like, “Hmm, gee, how would I like to spend my life?” Right?I think thinking about things like a choice lends itself to that kind of mentality. “Well youshould just choose to stop”. But if it was that easy, then rehabs wouldn't exist. Therewould be no need because people would just stop when things started to get reallyshitty. They don't. Logically that doesn't make a lot of sense.Because we know it's a brain disease and there are MRI studies they've done with whathappens in the brain when a person is shown cues for their drug of choice. There's aflurry of activity in the brain. So, we know the brain is affected.Aside: In one study conducted by NIDA on laboratory rats who had becomedependent on cocaine, they found that the neurons that are usually firing to inhibitbehavior to say, “No, Uh-uh. Don't do that.” They were like, crickets. Oddly inactive.Researchers activated those quiet, inhibiting parts and their interest in cocaine wentaway.Some Italian researchers are now attempting to replicate that using something calledTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation, which in some small trials has shown promisingeffects on folks who have relapsed multiple times with cocaine addiction. So, whoknows? Zip zap your brain back awake and those neurons are like, “Huh? What? Nosecandy? Ew. No.” 20Alie: Marisa Brewer wants to know: Advice for people with addiction in their family?Erin: See your own therapist. A term that is used is, loving detachment. You can't be tooinvolved in another person's addiction because you don't really have control over it. Youcan run yourself into the ground trying to save someone else, who really has to be theone to do the work for themselves.Seeing a therapist, talking to somebody about what's best for you, instead of the focusalways being on, “How do we help this other person” helps set healthy boundaries. Soyou can make choices that protect yourself but also might create an opportunity forchange for your loved one as well.Aside: Of course, changing yourself and taking better care of yourself and maybeestablishing some healthy boundaries may bring a whole change to your whole familysystem, for the better, Erin says.Alie: Mike Monikowski asked: Are non-drug behaviors like sex or video games addictive theway drugs are?Erin: I have treated a number of clients who have had behavioral addictions really take overtheir lives. Like in the example I use is a poop bucket. Somebody who is so focused ontheir video games that they won't leave the video game to go to the toilet.Alie: Does that happen?Erin: It does happen. I wouldn't say commonly, but that's the kind of example that I wouldthink of. If you find yourself pooping into a bucket so you don't have to put your videogame controller down, that might be a sign.Alie: Perhaps.Erin: If you're making decisions that hurt you or somebody else for any sort of behavior,that's worth taking a look at. Again, nobody's dream is to be pooping into a bucket [songwith lyrics: Poop, poop, poop, poop in a bucket, yeah! Let's all poop in a bucket.]Alie: Sure, someone out there, but not under those conditions, I'm sure. [Erin laughing]Erin: That's something different.Alie: Yeah.Aside: So ask yourself: Is this behavior or addiction or habit causing problems inyour life? Maybe just get real, have a chitty-chatty with your mirror reflection.A few different patrons also asked about skin picking disorders, AKA excoriationdisorder or dermatillomania. Are they an addiction?Erin: I mean, almost anything could be seen on the addiction spectrum. That might also beunder the anxieties spectrum. There are some things that are helpful, like making sure 21you're taking care of your skin. If you have dry chapped lips, that might lend itself tomore picking than not dry chapped lips. The same is true about skin or hair pulling.Managing anxiety, looking at things like the way you cope with stress or anxiety, makingsure you're taking care of yourself all around, even some of the basics, making sureyou're getting enough sleep.For things that will work for the individual person, it's usually most helpful to talk to atherapist.Aside: I have a few dear friends who suffer from this and though there are practicaltips like using vitamin E oil on your skin to help heal it and make it harder to futz withand wearing gloves and cutting fingernails super short -- all awesome advice -- my palsseem to have good results when addressing the underlying anxiety, either throughchanging medications, finding one that works better, or having a meditation program Ihave seen work really well with some of my friends. Just know, you’re not alone. You’rejust an anxious cute little monkey, and that’s okay.Alie: Kayli Stead says: Why are some people more prone to addiction than others? Is there aneasy answer for that?Erin: There is a genetic component to addiction. I think a lot of our cultures, our individualbackgrounds, play a role in it. People who come from families where drinking a lot isnormalized and drinking goes with everything. The same is true about certain drug useor opinions about going to the doctor or taking pills or whether or not seeking outmental health treatment is acceptable. There's a lot of things that play into it.Aside: How does addiction vary among different populations? Tragically,Indigenous populations in America have the highest rate of substance abuse and thosewho identify as a sexual minority, have higher percentage than any other group.Remember that traumas or lack of access to adequate mental health resources can oftenresult in self-medicating. The factors could be social, socio-economic, and genetic. Erinreminds us though that no group is spared because the factors leading to a substanceuse disorder are so varied.It's not that addiction strikes any one community, any one group of people or anyonetype of person. It affects everybody or it could affect anyone. It tends to be that how itcame about is what's different.It might be that in lower income neighborhoods, a different substance is more common.Then in more affluent populations, there may be more designer drugs orpharmaceuticals.Alie: Joe Porfido wants to know: What do you think the most addictive substance on earth is?Erin: I really think it depends on the person. They call it a drug of choice for a reason. When Iworked in a rehab, we didn't separate the clients by their drug of choice because theyhad more things in common than they had different, regardless of what the drug of 22choice was. Somebody could be there for an addiction to marijuana versus heroineversus cocaine. Everybody's in the same place.Alie: Tina Rautio wants to know: How can we reduce the stigma surrounding addictionrecovery? Signed, “A five-year sober recovering alcoholic.”Erin: Oh, congratulations to her! What was her name?Alie: Tina Rautio.Erin: Congratulations, Tina Rautio on your five years. That's amazing.I would love to see more people in recovery visible. I had mentioned previously that themedia tends to show people only in the throes of addiction. The TV show Mom, I reallylike that show. It's really funny and I think it's pretty relatable.Yes, certainly, there are relapses and hard things about addiction covered in the show,but they are also in recovery. Pretty successfully give or take, and I would love to seemore people in recovery be visible and not have it be the focus of their story because it'snot who they are as a person, but it is part of them. I think only seeing people who arevery ill and their addiction contributes to the thought that people don't get better.Alie: Stephanie Broertjes wants to know: What is the industry doing to improve patientoutcomes and reduce relapse rates? Emily Nill had a similar question: Is there a way totransition from total abstinence recovery to smart recovery without turning it into arelapse? A little bit about relapses. What can we do to improve outcomes and reducerelapses?Erin: Step down care is one of the things that we're doing to improve outcomes. It's notnecessarily that you need to be in a residential treatment center for months and monthsand months in order to get better. One of the focuses has been on doing some sort ofresidential treatment or detox just to get a solid base, but then continuing in treatmentin a stepdown way.Going from residential to partial hospitalization where you go for several hours a day,five days a week, three days a week before starting to see a therapist weekly for an hour.So that you’re really supported through the whole process. So if something starts to gowrong it gets caught pretty quickly.Going from a 30-day rehab back home without any middle steps is not a good plan. Youneed the step down.Alie: What about relapses if you've been recovered for a while? How do people recognize thatthey might be in danger of a relapse? How do you kind of right the car?Erin: Taking care of yourself as a whole person is really important. Have you ever heard theterm dry drunk? 23Alie: Yes, I have. What does it mean?Erin: A dry drunk is somebody who stops drinking but doesn't really change anything else.They're not working on recovery. They're probably not working on themselves as aperson, not looking to change any of the other behaviors except the drinking by itself.That's not a good plan for long term.Not only are you looking at stopping either drinking or doing drugs or whatever theproblem behavior was, but adding other things to your life, taking better care ofyourself, developing stronger relationships, healthier across the board, decreases thelikelihood of a relapse.Somebody who's not making any changes except “I'm just going to stop doing this onething”, that's not a good plan.Aside: Some signs that a period of sobriety might be a little threatened: someonestarts voicing destructive thoughts or ideas, forgets their usual healthy habits, stopsbringing salads to work, who knows? Has mood swings, maybe neglects some copingskills or isolates from friends or family.If a relapse does occur, some doctors say it’s better to call these just slips, so that oncesomeone stumbles in sobriety it’s not a, “Well screw the whole thing then. I relapsed.”So, a relapse by any other name would be a slip. You slipped, it sucked, it was not worthit, but get on back up, keep trucking, kiddo.Alie: Chris Brewer asked: Do you feel that those who are incarcerated and suffer fromaddiction can receive proper treatment in a correctional setting, or are most releasedback into society without receiving the treatment that they needed?Erin: Good question. There are programs offered in prison. They're not usually offered topeople who are in jail for a short term. Somebody who might go for a few weeks to a fewmonths probably doesn't have much access to any sort of real treatment, but for somepeople the fact that they were arrested is a wakeup call and they may be forced toobtain some level of sobriety there, depending on what's available and the specific jail.Anybody who's incarcerated for a longer period of time might have access to atreatment program. Though I wouldn't say it's the ideal treatment program, it issomething. And for people who want to make a change, they can take advantage ofprograms like that. Oftentimes there are things like AA offered in prisons as well.Somebody who wants to get better and wants to make a change there, they can, butagain, not ideal.Alie: Nathan-Andrew Leaflight wants to know: Are OCD and addiction functionally similar,either mentally or physically? 24Erin: There's some debate in the field about that. Some people see addiction more as an OCDtype of behavior, an obsession that and then a compulsive behavior, but not everyone. Ican definitely see where there's overlap.Aside: One study showed that, on average, 10% of folks will have a substance usedisorder but for people who are already seeking treatment for OCD, that jumps up toone-quarter. Suggesting that yes, the risk is higher if you have underlying OCD. Now, assomeone who is very curious about workahol, this question was close to my heart andto my brain.Alie: Kim Edgar wants to know: I have heard something about addiction to stress being athing. Is this a thing?Erin: I wouldn't put it addiction to stress per se, but some people thrive on chaos. It's athrilling, it's interesting. That's true for a lot of people who are addicted to other things.The, “I never know what's going to happen. Anything could happen.” It's exciting. Thenthey get into recovery.I use this example about dating a whole lot. When you are used to those really excitingrelationships that are hot and cold and they move fast. We jumped right in, we just met,but now we're living together.Then you meet someone, there's date number one and they call when they say they'regoing to call and they take you to the movies and you hold hands and then they drop youoff at 10 o'clock. That's not that exciting, even if it's maybe healthier than what you'reused to and not abusive and respectful.There are people who are maybe addicted to the thrill or the excitement. That's a type ofstress.Aside: This next question was also asked by Mike Monikowski.Alie: Amber Woodpark [phonetic] and a few other people asked: Cannabis, is it really nonaddictive or is there something else going on there? Is pot addictive?Erin: Yes.Alie: Okay.Erin: It's in the DSM. You can be addicted to pot. Yup.Alie: Okay.Erin: Again, like it's not a fair comparison to things like heroin, but there are withdrawalsymptoms. People who become addicted to pot, if they try and stop, they usually havesymptoms like trouble sleeping, more anxiety. 25One of the jokes is, you may not know you're in withdrawal from pot, but everyonearound you does. You might be irritable. You're a pain in the ass. [male voice: “The nameis not Grumpy McGrumperson.”] So yes, it's addictive.People might spend money they don't have on pot. They take risks with their jobs orwith their kids that they probably shouldn't.Aside: This next one was also wondered about by Ariel Levitt and ShannonPatterson.Alie: Chris Brewer and Bonnie Joyce both asked: Is sugar more addictive than cocaine?They've heard that. True or false? What do you think?Erin: I would say false.Alie: Yeah, I'll look it up.Aside: Looked it up. That paper is widely loudly scoffed upon by most addictionexperts. So, flim-flam!Alie: Of course, this is a question that probably so many people have, Radha Vakhria asked:Smoking. What's the deal? Why are cancer sticks so hard to quit?Erin: It's also a good question.The support to quit cigarettes is not the same as the support to quit other things.Somebody mentioned that there is a Nicotine Anonymous, but that's one of those thingsthat isn't brought up very often. I don't know that it's well attended or that there aremany meetings, but if it was, maybe that would make a difference to people.A lot of people, there's a big thing in the rehab community. Should your rehab allowsmoking or not? Should you kick all of your addictions, or does it mean you lose peoplewho are willing to give up “harder drugs”. You lose them if you also force them to giveup cigarettes cause a lot of them won't come to rehabs where they have to give upsmoking too.Alie: Right.Erin: So, different opinions on that.Aside: One opinion on e-cigarettes is that they’ve shown to help curb smoking, buttypically more in the short term, according to one University of Toronto study. Somefolks worry that the prevalence of vaping is just going to normalize smoking. Whichremains, by the way, the leading preventable cause of death. 480,000 Americans dyingeach year from smoking related causes.What are some top tips to quit? Making a financial incentive was the most effective, sosave the money you’d spend on smokes for another indulgence like a vacation or a 26purchase you've been eyeing. Or, make a bet with someone. Someone who's a jerk, andwon't let you off the hook.Other tips from QuitSmokingCommunity.org are to drink water when cravings start.You can have something to distract yourself. Breathe deeply. Call a friend. Go for a walk.You can sign up for my Patreon at the level you’d spend each month on cigarettes, andthen every time you go to light up, just think of my face crying and saying, “But I loveyou and want you to live. Also, cancer is so expensive.” Just kidding. You can give themoney to a charity if you want, but please do picture me crying.Alie: Beatrice Rumfoord wants to know: The opioid crisis. How can public institutions adjusttheir practices and facilities to provide trauma-informed service for those affected byaddictions, those with a disorder and their friends and families? Your take on what wecan do to help support people who might be dealing with an opioid addiction.Erin: Several pronged answers. In Florida where I am, that has been a huge issue, and there'sbeen crackdowns on the pill mills and the prescribers of opiates and we also use thecentralized prescription monitoring system, which is not required for prescribingphysicians to take part in, but a lot of them do. That's been really helpful to cut down onthings like doctor shopping, just going from doctor to doctor to get more and morescripts.Things like that, but also recognizing, that's one of the scenarios where an addiction iseasily missed. “It comes from the doctor. I do with the doctor tells me, I'm sick, I havepain, I need this.” It's easy to come up with a lot of excuses until things have progressedto a pretty dangerous place.I think having an awareness, asking questions and also learning about Narcan. I don'tknow if you're familiar with Narcan.Alie: Yeah, yeah.Erin: At the opioid overdose reversal medication, which the FDA just approved a generic thatyou can get over-the-counter, I think without a prescription. That's what over-thecounter means. It's a nasal spray, so it's really easy to administer and it is amazing theway it works and saves lives.Encouraging the loved ones of people who are addicted to opiates, or even are justprescribed opiates, it's an easy thing to have on hand. It should be fairly inexpensive ifthe generic's approved, and you could save somebody's life that way. Just a couplesquirts up the nose.Aside: In October 2018 the podcast Hidden Brain did a whole episode on Narcanentitled The Lazarus Drug and it’s a really, really chilling look at the opioid epidemic.Okay, moving this train along. 27Alie: My last question before the two last questions. Nobody on this thread so far, 75questions on Patreon, I don't know if anyone has asked about coffee addiction, butwhat's your take on it?Erin: Caffeine. Yeah.Alie: You can walk into a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and be like, “I will take seven shots ofespresso in a cup. Goodbye and thank you,” and have an absolute panic attack later[Futurama episode, Bender: “You been up all night? Fry: Of course, I have been up all night.Not because of caffeine, it was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need anap.] [Both Erin and Alie laughing] and it's fine. Why is it so acceptable? Do you drinkcoffee? What's the deal?Erin: I do drink coffee.Alie: Okay.Erin: Good question. [quiet DJ airhorn] It is definitely socially acceptable and the best answerI can come up with is that it doesn't get you high the same way.Alie: Okay.Erin: We definitely develop a dependence and withdrawal when we stop drinking it. Butwould you say that you're under the influence after a cup? How many cups would it taketo really alter your mental state?Alie: Yeah. For me, as someone with a diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder, it doesn't takemuch for me to be like ...I had a Yerba Matte addiction, we'll use that term loosely, years ago. It would throw meinto panic attacks and it didn't occur to me that they were related for a couple of years,and I would be, “Why am I having a panic? Like absolute, cannot handle my shit rightnow.” Finally, I linked the two.I dunno. I think, of course, drug of choice really depends on what you're-- for me, I mighthave been using caffeine in a way to get me to work more because of an underlyinganxiety that I wasn't working enough. You know what I mean. I guess it all is ...Erin: Everything kind of circles back together. Right.Alie: Yeah.Erin: If somebody was a generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks were to go see atherapist, the therapist might ask, “How much caffeine are you having? Are you willingto take a look at cutting down on that?” Because it does make anxiety worse. We don'tneed to ramp you up anymore.Alie: Yeah, I know. 28Aside: P.S. Someone did. One Norman P. Schmidt PhD is a researcher in Tallahassee,Florida studying the effects of caffeine on anxiety.Okay, here are some facts. The average consumption of caffeine in 1999: 120 mg per day2017: 190. That's a pretty big jump! Ha! However, that’s nothing compared to 1946,when the average American drank almost double what we do know with a very jittery,sloshy 48 gallons of coffee a year. Did they even drink water? I don't know. I don't knowwhat to tell you. But Norman P. Schmidt does.One treatment he supervises in patients is getting them to work up to a cup of coffeespiked with No Doz so they can just chase that dragon, just ride that sweaty train toPanicville and learn, “Oh, ok. This is just chemical. This is chemical anxiety. The world isnot garbage. I’m just having a panic attack. I mean the world is garbage, but this is just apanic attack.”I’m just teeing this up for a shitty question.Alie: I wonder if they look at that and they see a rise in people's anxiety disorders at allbecause we just don't realize. “I'll have a triple macchiato with oat milk and also, I'll seemy doctor for Xanax.” It's interesting.Erin: To calm down so I can go to sleep later.Alie: Yeah. Hey, someone get a PHD in that. So shittiest thing about your job, I can't evenimagine talking to someone who treats patients with some of the most gut-wrenchingaddictions. What is the hardest part about your job?Erin: This is the part that's a bummer, right?Alie: Yeah. Yeah.Erin: That some of them do die.Alie: Yeah.Erin: I have had clients pass away, and sometimes it's as a direct result of their addiction.Sometimes it's not as a direct result. That makes me cry too.Alie: Yeah.Erin: That's when I cry sad tears, but it is the nature of the beast. It's a deadly disease and Ihave to take the treatment of it seriously because it does kill people, and everyone's lifematters.Alie: Do you ever have an inkling for who won't make it?Erin: Yeah, I won't say that I'm right all the time. I would say there's lots of times I'm notright. Sometimes I just have a feeling and you just never know though.29Alie: Yeah.Erin: There are some clients I've had that being arrested and going to prison saved their life.They just could not, or would not I guess, outside of that kind of setting.It's amazing to hear from someone a few years down the line like, “Hey, I got sober injail and I'm still doing it.” But you have to assume that everybody's at risk andeverybody's worth fighting for.I saw this tee shirt once that said, “I became a counselor because your life is worth mytime.” That just really got me in my therapist's heart. Yeah.Aside: She says, “Obviously, that’s much worse than administering pee tests.”Which she’s done a lot of.Erin: I've handled a lot of urine. [Erin laughing]Alie: Did you ever get an inkling if maybe some, maybe it wasn't someone's own pee?Erin: Definitely. [Erin Laughing]Alie: It's like refrigerated?Erin: Sometimes it wasn't the right temperature. Sometimes the devices they had preparedwould fall and become evidence.Alie: Oh no. Like a little thermos? Some kind of hot pee thermos?Erin: Yeah. Or like the Whizzinator. Are you familiar with the Whizzinator?Alie: Not familiar!Erin: You're going to have to look that up.Alie: Oh, no!Aside: Oh boy howdy oh boy. Ah, wow. Did I just tumble down a rabbit hole ofpeople strapping hollow dongs on themselves and using handwarmers tucked into beltsand also desiccated internet urine? Boy wowzers. Just, so much work. I got tired justwatching the tutorials. If you get caught using one, what do you do? I guess just say, “Yawhizzed me!” Anyway.Erin: There's like a lot of funny stories around drug testing. In detox, guys who would testpositive for pregnancy, things like that.Aside: What is the best thing about Erin’s job?Erin: Helping people, of course, seeing people succeed. It's so rewarding and so special. It'ssomething that's not public because of all the privacy laws around it. There’re so many 30things that I get to see and be a part of that I keep to myself, and I'm thinking most of myclients probably keep to their selves as well.It ends up being so special, very intimate thing that I get to be a part of. It has reallyhelped to me be kind to people who are maybe not having a good day, and maybe arenot as kind. It's given me a lot of patience and a lot of appreciation for the difficultiesthat other people are going through that I might not know.What's that saying? “Be kind, for everyone you know is fighting a hard battle.” I feel likethat because there's a lot of people I've seen, addicted or not, they don't look like they'rehaving problems from the outside. If you saw them in the grocery store, you'd neverknow. Then I know about these deep things they're battling, and you just never knowwhat somebody else is going through.Alie: Any resources or books that you would point to, to people who might be struggling?Erin: One of my favorite books is called Healing the Addicted Brain by Harold Urschel. It goesthrough a lot about the addictive brain stuff, and it's sciencey but not so sciency that itwould necessarily be too much for someone who's not sciency. Like me. There's achapter in there for families as well, that's really helpful.I also like Codependent No More because a lot of the people that end up in relationshipswith people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol. They say like being codependent islike being addicted to a person. So the loved one is addicted to drugs or alcohol and thenthe partner's addicted to them.Aside: The Language of Letting Go and Codependent No More are by Melanie Beatty.Wonderful books. If you’re like, “Why am I always putting others’ needs above my ownor trying to clean up others messes or doing too much or thinking I have to earn love?Huh? Hmmm? Huh?” Good books. Just saying.Erin: HBO did an addiction series a while ago that Nora Volkow was a part of, and they doshort vignettes on different topics in addiction. They are filming in an emergency roomand there's different related stuff that comes in. Then there's brain scans. There's a lotof good stuff out there.Alie: Oh good. Where can people find you?Erin: I do have a website called Erin Can Help. Www.ErinCanHelp.com.Alie: Oooh!Erin: Adorable, right?Alie: That's so sweet, yes! [Erin laughing]Erin: I also have a Facebook page for my business, that I include all kinds of things that arerelated to mental health and addiction. I don't only treat addiction, I'm out there.31Alie: Ah, yay. Thanks for making me cry, dude.Erin: Yeah. Thanks for making me cry. [Both laughing] Happy tears, though. I mean, there's somuch good out there. it’s your sister’s new boyfriend, who you’re quietly judging because of his cracked phonescreen and bad shoes, Alie Ward, back with another episode of Ologies. If this is your very firstepisode, just a few things. We swear a whole bunch in this; we swear in a lot of ‘em, most of ‘em. Ifyou wish we didn’t, don’t freak out, there are bleeped episodes of the podcast available atAlieWard.com. I’ll put a link in the show notes. Moving the danged heck on.Okay so frickin’ toads. What are they? And are they the best or are they the worst? Are toads theunsung underdogs? Are they warty friends yet to be made? Or are they bastards? Do they belong ina heap of canceled beasts who don’t deserve our admiration? You’ll find out.But first, business, in which I thank everyone on Patreon.com/Ologies for their questions, for theirpatronhood, for making the show feasible and possible and just a joy to make. Also, thank you toeveryone sporting Ologies merch from OlogiesMerch.com and everyone who just gets it and knowsthat making sure that you’re subscribed and rating the show helps us get seen by pre-ologites,people who don’t know about the show yet.Also, thanks to the kind folks who are leaving reviews, because you know that I read them when I’min a hotel, eating gas station food, and they make my day. So I read you a new one each week as athank you, and this week Justine D. said:My grandma passed away recently and the only thing I could do to keep myself from cryingwas listening to Ologies. Alie, you helped me laugh when I felt like crying; that’s huge. Keep itup, my friend.Justine, I’m so sorry about your grandma. I’m sending you a hug. Everyone, text your grandma–does your grandma text? If you have a grandma, text her and say, “Hey, thanks for pushing out ababy that pushed out a baby,” or you can word it however you want to word it.Okay. Bufology. Let’s go down a toad hole. Let’s get the hell into it. So bufology is a word that I didnot make up although it’s seldom cited, to be fair. A 2011 Reptile Magazine article titled “Ode to aToad” uses the term ‘Bufology 101’, so I’m going with it. There’s also herpetology, which is reptilesand amphibians, there’s batrachology, which is the subfield that is just amphibians and which I mayhave pronounced wrong, but I tried to pronounce it so many times.But what if I want to do a frog episode down the line? Or one on newts? So, I’m going with Bufology,because it exists, people use it sometimes, also its root is bufo, the Latin for ‘toad’, which may comefrom a word meaning slimy plant, or it may also come from bufare, meaning to puff up, andbuffoonery is a related word. It’s debatable, like toads, for some people.So where are you with toads? You know what? It doesn’t matter, because in an hour and changeyou’ll be padding out to the backyard on little bare feet with your coffee mug every morning, justhoping for a toad encounter. Mark my words!This Ologist is wonderful. We tried to meet up so many times in the past year or so but our travelplans kept hitting snags, and then this past week we both happened to be thousands of miles awayfrom our respective homes; we were in Minneapolis on the same night. She was on a road trip-toadtrip and I was on this Ologies Midwestern interview bonanza. So I used your Patreon money to gether a nice room in the same hotel and, with butterflies, I went down to it, kind of like a nervous 2Tinder date. She’s a gorgeous soul. She’s so funny, and candid, and enthusiastic about toads and Ilove her and I hope we are always friends.So, if this is your first episode of Ologies, boy howdy, buckle up. Get ready to hear a scientistpassionately describe a love of toads. She’s so human. I cherish her. She was once the programmanager for the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies where she also served as a nationalcoordinator for Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation. She worked as a biological sciencetechnician for the US geological survey in the Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative, andnow works in the non-profit ecology sector at Conservation Science Partners. But is still in the fielda bit, out toading and salamandering and frogging and newting, but today she is in a Minnesotahotel, about to get super bufological with me, so hop on in to a conversation with amphibianenthusiast and Bufologist, Priya Nanjappa.----------Alie Ward: [whispering to herself walking through the hotel] On my way to see Priya… eightoh-six here we go, gonna meet Priya, gonna talk toads… eight-oh-six… Oh mygosh. Here we go. This is like a blind date. I’m so excited. [door opens] Toads!Toads! Toads![now seated with Priya] You are a lover of toads.Priya Nanjappa: Yes!Alie: What is it about toads specifically that you love? Why don’t I open with a question that wecould do a whole series on? [laughs]Priya: Oh yeah! There’re so many things to love! So, I was thinking about this because I knew youwere gonna ask me this and there’s so many different ways I could go with this question, butI think just in general I tend to be somebody who likes the underdog, you know what I mean?The thing that people don’t want to love, you know? And that kind of plays into my romanticlife as well too but anyway, that’s a whole other story. They’re just so fucking cute! They’refat, and they’re grumpy-faced, and you just know that they’re really not grumpy, or you wantthem to really not be grumpy, but they wanna act grumpy. They wanna act tough, they puffup.Aside: Priya studied Wildlife Biology with a minor in Environmental Studies at Iowa StateUniversity and then she went on to get a Master’s in Conservation Biology at Ball University.Her work involved developing the first national database of amphibian distributions andmaps. Kind of like a census taker, just going off to tiny toad houses, sayin’, “Hey, knockknock, howdy-hoo, pardon. How many of you livin’ in that log? I’d like to observe you eatingbugs and doing the nasty.” But what got her into it?Priya: I remember my first toad sighting, which was in my mom’s garden, in Iowa. It just would hopalong the tomato plants and eat things, and eventually we figured out we could build a littletoad hut, out of a pot, and put that in there and it would just go and hang out. I was so sad onthe days when I didn’t see it, like I’m sure it was all seasonal but I don’t remember thespecifics of it. But I do remember other people’s houses where there’d be one sitting underthe gutter, eating the flies and stuff like that. And I liked other critters too, but there wassomething about the toads that I just kept coming back to, that I just kept… I don’t know. Ijust love them. They just have that face, you know? It’s just that face.Alie: I love that you had a toad friend! Like, that toad was your friend.Priya: [laughs] It kind of was my friend.3Aside: Her warty buddy got a toad abode and in return it ate all the bugs that wanted to eattheir lettuces. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. Kind of like when you dog sit, andthen also while you’re there you eat all their snacks.Priya: And then somehow we figured out or looked it up – there was no internet back in thosedays – but we figured out that there it was gonna be a helpful thing. So that toad lived there,and I want to think that the same toad came back year after year, but I know we definitelysaw a toad in the garden at least a couple of years.Alie: Maybe the great grandson of the original toad!Priya: Oh my god, that would be just so delightful if that was true!Alie: How long do they live?Priya: There’s a variety of age ranges, just depending on the species. I think probably ten years, fiveto ten years is on average in the wild, but there’s some in captivity that can live really long.Alie: They look ancient. They look like they’re in their 80s. All of them look like Wilford Brimleybut hairless and green!Priya: [laughs] They totally do! [clip: “I’m Wilford Brimley and I’d like to talk to you for a few minutesabout diabeetus.”]Aside: PS, Wilford Brimley was a TV star who was also known for his Quaker Oatscommercials, and for changing the American pronunciation of diabetes to diabeetus. [WilfordBrimley: “Diabeetus.”]Also, I just looked up some facts about Wilford Brimley and one of the most stunning is he’svery much alive! He’s only 84 years old, which means that he was just 60 when he wasplaying like deep, deep grandpa genre roles. I respect him for just leaning into that. So, toads.Tiny grumpy grandpas. They are grump-pas. Okay but what makes a toad a toad?Alie: Straightaway, what is the difference between a frog and a toad?Priya: So, generally speaking, most frogs have smooth skin, they tend to need a closer associationwith water or aquatic environments. Then the toads that we traditionally know, with the bigfat stout bodies and the warts and everything, they typically can be away from water longer,and they don’t need as much of that, sort of, direct moisture the way that frogs do. And thenthey also secrete these toxins from their skin. That’s the biggest thing. There are some frogsthat do that as well. But pretty much all toads have some sort of gland and they secrete somesort of bufotoxin.Alie: Bufotoxin! Sounds like such a good punk band. “Bufotoxin!”Priya: Right? Yeah.Alie: Is their skin thicker? And what exactly are the warts? Are they air-quotes warts?Priya: That’s a good question. These warts on toads are associated with mucous glands andgranular glands. But the granular glands are the ones that are responsible for the toxicsecretions, and it’s for anti-predator defense so that when anything grabs it, it just tastesbad, and they spit it out, or sometimes they’ll get sick. Some of the toads produce somepretty strong toxins. So, all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads.Alie: Oh, I love those. It’s the old “All, cactus are succulents, not all succulents are cacti.”4Priya: Yes, exactly. Or like in the amphibian world, there’s newts, all newts are salamanders but notall salamanders are newts. Newts are to salamanders like toads are to frogs. Early lineages oftoads, they look more froglike, and over time, those different features, the more stout bodies,and the bigger warts and glands, appear later in evolutionary history. They came after frogs,so somewhere in that Cretaceous-Cenozoic period. They’ve been around.Alie: Oh jeez, they’re Wilford Brimleys.Aside: So, side note. Wonderfully British vertebrate paleontologist Darren Naish haswritten extensively on toad evolution and its many gnarled branches. And also, he has a petcane toad named Milo, which looks like it can kick my ass.Anyway, more on cane toads in a minute but cane toads, like frogs, have teeth. Sort of. Theyhave little peg-like nubbins. But other toads do not have teeth. To recap: toads are frogs, andtoads have no teeth, yes for warts, they’ve got a poison gland behind their eye called aparotid gland, thought to have been an adrenal gland just gone bonkers. Oh, and anothersouped-up special feature not available on the standard frog model:Priya: And the other really weird thing is that toads have this thing called the Bidder’s organ, whichsits kind of between the kidneys and the gonads. And I think both males and females havethem, but they’re thought to be like a primitive ovary.Alie: What!? [slowed down: “Whaaat?”]Priya: Kind of like a spare set of follicles, but the males have it too. So in experiments in the lab,they’ve removed the testes, just castrated them, and all of a sudden this Bidder’s organ islike, “Oh! Okay! Time for me to come into play!” and it starts forming eggs.Alie: No way!Priya: Initially when I had learned about it, I thought maybe it would create sperm or something inthe males and eggs in the females but no, it always produces eggs. It has follicles. Then thesame thing with the females, if one of the ovaries doesn’t work, then it will start to come intoplay.But the other interesting thing with the males is that in some situations where there’sestrogen-mimic chemicals or other chemical things that will chemically castrate, all of asudden that organ starts taking off. It’s named after the dude who discovered it, but it alwaysrelates to eggs and oocytes, and that means that the ability to possess ovaries is probably,like, the original evolutionary condition. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. [laughs]Alie: I love it! Publish it! I just peer-reviewed it. No paywalls. And then what about their big crazyweird ear drum?Priya: So, they do have that tympanum, and that’s how they can hear each other sing their lovelysongs. But those ones in those areas where they don’t call, they have lost their ear drums. Sothey just do the waving thing, or whatever, and they don’t even need them anymore, so theydon’t have them. It’s just that tympanic membrane, and most frogs have them, and it’s just alittle drumhead, basically, and they sense vibrations from the calls of others. They can tellthe difference between their own species, obviously, and others.Alie: What about their eyes? Is their eyesight good? Eyesight bad? I’ve never seen them in glasses.Priya: I don’t think they’re supposed to have very good– I’ve never seen them in glasses either.They would look so good in glasses, though, wouldn’t they? They would look so good. Justlike some little hipster, sort of thick-framed glasses, or those ones without the rims.5I don’t think they’re thought to have great eyesight, but I don’t think it’s bad. They candiscern color though, because some toads are sexually dimorphic more than just the size,there’s actually color differences, kind of like in birds. So, they must have some color vision.Alie: Are the males bigger than the females?Priya: The females are bigger than the males.Alie: By a lot?Priya: Yeah, by a lot. Usually by quite a bit. If you see them mating, it’s like this tiny male on top ofthis big ol’ female and it always looks a little funny.Aside: Oh, and both have tympanums to hear sound, such as for example, the romanticscreamy love ballads man-toads make by inflating an air sac like a big extra chin, kind of likehaving a subwoofer on your face. Heyyyy!Priya: So, another thing that’s really cool about toads is they have a lot more bony material in theirskull. Their skulls are highly ossified, and those crests and the shape of those crests are whatyou can use to distinguish species when they are in the same area and you have a lot ofsimilar looking little brown toads with warts. Other than the warts-per-spot. In the darkbrown spot, there’ll be two or three warts if it’s an American toad, and then if it’s a Fowler’stoad or a Woodhouse’s toad it’ll have more in each dark spot.And then there’s the shape of the parotid glands, which are the things behind their eyes thatproduce more of the toxic secretion, and then those little crests and bosses and ridges andeverything. That’s how they differentiate themselves. So yeah, they have these really coolskulls. Frogs don’t have that. You think of them as the cave men. They’re actually the onesthat came later.Alie: Gonna get, like, a full toad back tattoo. [laughs] It’s gonna happen! There are toads on allcontinents?Priya: Everywhere except Australia, which right now is being overrun by the invasive cane toad.Alie: Oh really? Australia got a little bit ripped off on the toad card and then they got payback.Priya: Yeah, and they didn’t used to be on Madagascar either but now there’s a different toad that isfound on Madagascar that’s also super invasive and wreaking havoc. Unfortunately, thetoads that are finding their way to places where they never were are the ones you just don’twant to be there.Aside: Okay let’s loop around back real quick and talk about cane toads, shall we? Okay,great. So, these are these huge-ass toads, they’re also called marine toads, even thoughthey’re terrestrial (Linnaeus made, like, an oopsie daisy in the 1700s about their habitat).But the largest recorded one measured over 9 inches long.They look like holding a big leathery pretzel roll but with legs. And they are college-stonerlevel hungry. They eat everything from live bats, sometimes plants, to bugs, to dead animals,to just straight up garbage. Sometimes just literal, actual garbage. Most scientists report theyseem to give few, if any, fucks, enabling them to get both large and in charge.They also have successful and very prolific mating strategies. So, in summation, cane toads,they’re like the Romans. They like to eat, they like to make love, and they’re native to theAmericas and even south Texas, but they now live all over the damned place because in the1930s someone was like, [old timey accent] “Hey, I got an idea, see?”6Priya: So, it was like where they were growing sugar cane they had brought them there to controlthe bugs that were eating the sugar cane. And then of course, any time you bring a thing tocontrol the thing that you don’t want then that thing goes crazy. So, they are these big, beefymarine toads, so they can tolerate saltwater environments, but they also apparently can liveall over the place, on land. So they’re in vast swathes of Australia and all over Hawaii, they’rein Florida now.Alie: How do you control a cane toad population?Priya: It’s proving to be really difficult. They have had some luck with, I want to say, caffeine.Where they’re dropping caffeine, or spraying caffeine. That has been effective in some placesin knocking down the population, and just generally they try to go and collect them up andthen euthanize them.Alie: Throw them in a volcano or something?Priya: Yeah, pretty much.Aside: So yes. Some parts of the world have a real cane toad problem. Also, the beetles thatthey were supposed to eat? They like to climb to the top of the sugar cane and the toads arelike, [whiny] “Ugh, that’s too high, no reachy. I’ll just eat this bird instead.”So now Australia has this bunch of poisonous toads, and sometimes people’s dogs eat themand trip absolute balls or just die. But caffeine? Really? As an agent for toad assassinations?So, what happens is, concentrated caffeine, when sprayed around by professional ecobarista, if you will, causes amphibians to have heart attacks, and they… well, they croak.DadWard really toad the line with that one, kiddos. Please don’t stop listening.Okay. So, concentrated caffeine gives them pretty much lethal panic attacks. But one canspread coffee grounds in the garden, and they might just get real buzzy and uncomfortableenough to just avoid the area. Kind of like how I didn’t go into a Starbucks for a while after aventi-induced anxiety meltdown. But this could just be wicked mean to slugs and such,because caffeine is a plant’s natural defense against getting munched on by a lot of critters.Also, this sent me down a weird hole learning that a plant can poison itself with its owncaffeine, so the leaves drop, the caffeine leaches into the soil, the plant is like, “Oh nuts. Ibrought this on myself.”Now, okay, if killing animals makes you squeamish, you could always just exploit them forprofit and become a drug dealer. So, Country Farm Lifestyles website offered up the advice ofpainting chloroform on the belly of a cane toad until they start oozing milky poison, andthen, just like a pimple full of money, you can gently express their parotid gland right behindtheir eyes. But watch your eyes; wear some cool steampunk goggles or something, so youdon’t get splat into on the eyeball and then wind up really crying over spilled milky whitepoison.Also, quick aside within this aside – a sideception, if you will – does Priya have a favoritetoad? Yes. She has a soft spot. She has a soft, warty spot for American toads because theywere the first she saw in the Midwest, but she did clarify that they no longer belong to theBufo genus. North American toads are now classified Anaxyrus, which sounds like a very coolrebrand, if you ask me. Bufo versus Anaxyrus? Reminds me of the time my goth friend Benwanted us to call him Sebastiane, with an e on the end. But unlike Anaxyrus, it didn’t stick.I’m sorry Sebastiane. Sebast-cheen?7Priya: They’re a little bit fatter and their eyes are just a little bit more, like, bulbous. So, I really kindof fell in love with them, but there’s some really pretty toads, too. In the Southwestern USthere are these green toads, and then these red-spotted toads. They can be really pretty,especially in South America. I haven’t really seen all the bufonid species that are down there,it would take millions of years, there’s so many species of toads all over the world. They arereally diverse and interesting.Aside: PS, how many species of toad are out there, hoppin’ around and frowning? It’s over600! And some look like dead leaves with a face, and some are beautiful rainbow colors,some we haven’t even discovered yet, right now, just kickin’ it in a hollow, I think.Alie: Is that where toads live? Do they live in toad hollows? Do they live in little carved-out spotsin trees and stuff?Priya: Pretty much in burrows of different sorts; some of them can do a little bit of digging but a lotof times they’ll live in other mammal burrows and things like that.Aside: For more on being roommates with a Gopher tortoise, see the Testudinologyepisode with Amanda Hipps. Also, I just tried to google ‘toads + friends + interspecies’ and I’llbe honest, not much popped up. I guess it’s lonely being horny and toxic.Oh, and if you’ve already heard the Thermophysiology episode with Dr. Shane CampbellStaton you might know a little bit about wood frog antifreeze, but how do toads get hygge –aka higgy – with it? That Scandinavian word for cozy-in-the-winter? Do they knit chunkyturtlenecks and sip hot table wine out of a crock pot? Do they all peace out to condos inFlorida when it gets chilly? What happens?Priya: They don’t freeze like some frog species can totally freeze in the winter, they produce thisantifreeze, but toads don’t do that. They just go underground below the frostline, where it’sjust warm enough that they can survive through the winter and they hibernate, but theydon’t freeze. They just live underground.Alie: I need you to settle something that’s been plaguing me for a long time. You love toads. You’vestudied toads. True or false: Toads have arms?Priya: [gasps in delight] Yes, they do! [laughs]Alie: Thank you! I don’t feel like toads have four legs. I feel like they have two legs and two arms.Priya: They do!Alie: Toads have arms!Priya: They do have arms! I mean, they’re like little Popeye arms, right? Couldn’t you just see a littletattoo on those little forearms? They’re sooo fat. And the males have fatter forearms onpurpose, to clutch on the ladies. Yeah, they have arms.Alie: Okay thank you!Priya: You will see it in different places and references, about their arms.Alie: Really? So, is that official?Priya: [pauses] I’m going to say it is. [DJ airhorn]Alie: Because I just cannot accept that those are legs! That’s not how legs work.Priya: No, they’re not even really forelegs. They really look like little wrestler arms. Totally.8Alie: And they have little hands, like little baby hands!Priya: They do have. Yeah.Alie: Okay that makes me feel better.Aside: Okay, I looked this up and they are called arms! They’re called arms! I went into thisthinking this was a battle I had to fight. I was willing to die and leave my corpse on this hillthat toads have arms, and instead, no one wanted to fight me! It’s just a known thing; theyhave a humerus, they have a fused radius and ulna bones, and four fingers, just like us! Theonly thing they can’t do is give me a knowing, appreciative thumbs up, because technicallytheir thumbs aren’t opposable.Anyway. Moving on. Priya has done a lot of work with a lot of amphibians, namelysalamanders, but her fieldwork helping collect toad data made her love them even more.Priya: Just a little ways into the season, the toads would come in and they could just be everywhere,and they were just so fun to watch and they’d have these big orgies. [slowed down:“Heeyyyyy”]And the eggs were everywhere. Then the tadpoles would be everywhere. There’s probably atleast a couple of sites where there was probably close to a hundred toads, hopping acrossroads… Whenever we would see them we’d measure them, and determine the sex, and lookfor overall health of the animals. We were doing that in general for the other critters toobecause we were finding, in some cases, some different malformations with some of the frogspecies. But we didn’t really find that with the toads, which is interesting. We definitely sawa lot of them, just out and about, and just hoppin’ along.You could really find them when they’re breeding, when they come to the ponds to breed.You’ll find them just hopping around in the woods but just very randomly. Once they come inand they do that, they get out. You don’t really know where they are or what they’re doing. Ijust imagine them underground in their burrows having little socials, little undergroundbars, just chilling out, all winter.Alie: Are they solitary, or do they burrow with friends, do you think? I wonder if they havegirlfriends, boyfriends…?Priya: I think there are some records of them sharing burrows with other toads. We actually founda multiple species hibernaculum. But I do think that there are toads that will share the sametypes of burrows, and then there’s some places where the soil is really sandy and they canjust shimmy down under the sand, especially in the hotter environments. In a lot of places inthe southern US, both east and west, they’re active pretty much year round, they don’t reallyhave much of a hibernation. But in the northern areas they do.Alie: Do they sleep?Priya: They do sleep. I’ve never seen a sleeping toad. Yeah, I haven’t seen a sleeping toad.Alie: Are they nocturnal or are they out in the day?Priya: When they first come out, it’s usually during the day and they will just be singing their littlehearts out, like all during the day. And then they kind of shift to just calling at night, so youdon’t really hear them during the day, but you’ll see them out there sometimes. Wedefinitely… when we go out in the field to our sites during the daytime, we would see thetoads, just everywhere, and they weren’t always calling by that point. But then if you came tothe same pond that night they would just be singing like crazy. So that was cool.9Aside: Ugh, listen to these beautiful sounds! [high trilling toad noise] That is nature’s way ofsinging “Ah’m pretty hoorrrrrnny! Ah’m over heeeere! I’m ready to be a daaaddddd tothousands of kids I’ll never meet! Once again: Ah’m very horrnny!” [clip from Old Yeller: “Wellnow, that’s a fine horny toad, and I want him bad!”]PS, where does the word ‘horny’ come from? I thought maybe I’d wander down a lush forestof bufological etymology. It turns out, horny toads aren’t even toads! They’re just anothername for the horned lizard. They just call these spiky-necked Southwestern lizards toadsbecause they have kind of a stout body. So, good morning world; we’ve been lied to forgenerations! Let’s get back to our real friends, the toads, and their robust sexuality.Alie: Talk to me about toad romance. You mentioned the word orgy. Let’s revisit that.Priya: [laughs] It’s true. Let’s do that.Alie: What is happening when toads all get together to make more toads?Priya: When toads start wanting to get their freak on, they are so indiscriminate sometimes. I’veseen a toad amplexing a rock. One time I was taking temperature of the water and therewere some toads nearby and this little toad hopped up and grabbed onto my fingers. Theyare so funny. They get all territorial and if they think… In that case obviously he thought, “Igotta get on that thing! That thing looks like I should mate that!”But sometimes they’re just defending their territory and they do that thing, they puff up. Andas I picked it up, they do this little release call, the American toads make this little [brief,high-pitched chirp].Alie: Like their version of a car alarm?Aside: Let’s hear that, shall we? [toad release-trill, a super tiny little chirp] Priya says thatrelease call essentially translates to, “Oops, nope, I’m a boy toad; pleeaase don’t mount mebro. Thanks buddy.”Priya: Just this little trill, as I was holding it. And yeah, I fell in love a little bit more that day.Alie: I don’t blame you.Priya: But they are just on everything. And because the males are also really competitive to get thefemales, there’s usually 3 or 4 on the females and we definitely would find sometimes, like,half-drowned females – and this happens with other frog species too – but where there’s somany males that they basically are weighing her down and her head is staying underwater.And they breathe air, so she’s getting drowned by all these aggressive fuckers.Alie: These eager dudes! Like, come on! Take a number!Priya: And she’s just like, “Look, yeah, I got one.”Alie: And she’s gonna squirt out some eggs, and then they’re just going to go by and “season”them, sort of?Priya: Well, yeah and they do have external fertilization. That’s part of the strategy. They’re justhanging out, and there’ll be ones that’ll be sitting there waiting for the one to hop off so thatthe next one can hop on.Alie: Okay. Tell me if I’m hallucinating. Is there a type of toad where the baby toads are birthedfrom holes in the back or was that on American Horror Story?10Priya: No, no, those are a different family, so they’re not bufonids, they’re not true toads. They’recalled the Suriname toad, and that’s the craziest reproductive strategy. They’ll lay the eggs,and they’ll be fertilized, and then they scoop them up with their legs onto their back. Andthen the chemistry of the skin changes, and it basically absorbs the eggs into their back, andthen the skin grows back over the top of it. [Alie groans] It’s like some serious sci-fi shit. Andthen when they get ready to hatch, they hatch out as little live… it’s not even tadpoles, it’slittle live baby toads, and they start cracking out of the mom’s back. It’s so crazy.Alie: That is such a horror show.Priya: Yeah.Alie: I mean it works for them and good for them.Priya: It works, right. But I mean, it’s really cool, actually. We use that a lot in outreach with kids asan example of cool adaptations that they have. And they’re always like, “Eww!! Let’s see itagain!” But yeah, that one’s a really freaky one. But those are not true toads. Those are in thePipidae family, not the Bufonidae family.Aside: So I looked this up, and as a person who has relaxed to dozens and dozens of videosof blackhead extractions, and bot fly maggots under human skin – shout out toLepidopterologist Phil Torres for fostering one in his back recently – and my personalfavorite, mango worm extraction, I found this Suriname toad thing revoollllting.First off, it just looks like a frog who’s been flattened by a mallet but came back as a muddy,angry ghost. The Suriname toad scientifically known as Pipa. Pipa means kite, because it’sflat and pointy. It looks like an angular, roast chicken breast, with webbed feet, and like amesh tank top of skin is its back. It’s riddled with holes, out of which, flailing, squirming,mini-toads emerge in a fury like a jailbreak. It’s a nightmare you cannot imagine, and if youhave that fear of holes? Whatever that’s called? Get a restraining order against this species. Ihave met my match. This is disgusting.Also, not even really a toad. It’s an aquatic frog. Get outta here! Let’s get back to toads. Godthis was gross. I mean, beautiful, but very upsetting.Alie: Let’s talk toad lickin’. Who’s doing it and why?Priya: Yeah, there’s a lot of people that are doing it, and they probably shouldn’t be doing it. So,there’s only one toad in the US that produces that particular type of bufotoxin. You can’t just,like, lick the toad. You will not be very comfortable if you just lick the toad. [giggles]Aside: [as if over a loudspeaker:] Again: Do. Not. Lick. The. Toad.Why? Consider this story a PSA against toad-basing:Priya: We were driving down this little golf course where another colleague of mine had theserattlesnakes telemetered, tagged so we could track them, and I just saw this thing hoppingalong and I was like, “What? Is that a bunny?” And he was like, “Those are the SonoranDesert Toads” and I was like, “What?! Those are those toads, the ones you can lick?” And hewas like, “Oh yeah, those are those ones.” And then we had to stop and went and checkedthem out, and he was like, “Now you’ve got to really wash your hands. Here’s some Purell.”Later on, I think I rubbed my nose or did something like that and it was really burning, fromthat little bit that was probably still on my hands. Thankfully, I didn’t touch my eyes becausethat can be a real problem. I think the Indigenous people had learned how to basically 11harvest it, and then I think you have to dry it and process it a little bit before you can actuallyuse it in those ways, to have the true hallucinogenic experience.Alie: So, you have to kind of milk them by stressing them out a little bit?Priya: Pretty much. But they do have a fair bit just on them. They’re pretty gnarly. But I don’t thinkit takes much to stress them out. Certain toads you can actually see the secretion, it’s thismilky stuff coming out.Alie: You just have to shit-talk their moms, they’re like “Urrhh!” It comes flowing out.Priya: [laughs] Exactly. There are these stories, though, that people will do it in such a way thatthey can still get a high, and just keep the toad so that they can harvest it. And I’m surepeople have studied all of these different ways of how you can make it happen, but I have notexperienced the toad high.Alie: I wonder if people on YouTube are like, “Listen. Here’s what you do.” I’ll be looking.Priya: Oh, I’m sure you will. And I’m looking forward to learning more about that.Aside: Oh, you know I will. Okay, so the Colorado River toad or the Sonoran Desert toad,same thing, they’re native to what’s now northern Mexico and the Southwestern UnitedStates. So, these produce a poison that has a form of the psychedelic substance DMT, which isproduced in humans naturally, but during a dream state and maybe when you die. [clip fromThe Simpsons: Homer moans in his sleep. Marge calls, “Homer? Hoooomer”]Do not go milking it and licking it; that’s not gonna work. For thousands of years, Indigenouscultures have perfected the harvesting, and the drying, and the smoking of this angry toadjuice. And what is said to result is everything from, like, a powerful love and oneness withnature, to feeling like dying and a rebirth, to seeing geometric aliens chirping welcomes intoanother dimension. Did I mention, Don’t Lick a Toad? Don’t try this on your own. This is nota Pinterest DIY hack to diddle with on the weekend. Respect the culture. Respect the history.Respect the toad.Alie: What about toads in popular culture? How do you feel about the children’s book series Frogand Toad? [clip from Frog and Toad: Frog, cheerfully, “Toad! Toad! The sun is shining! Thesnow is melting! Wake up!” Toad, grumpy, “Ohhh… I am not here.”]Priya: Oh my god, one of my favorite books, for real. Even before I really became a toad lover, it wasjust one of my favorite books. I just loved the little relationship that they had and how toadwas always so grumpy. I had Frog and Toad Are Friends, and that became the book that Igave all my friends when they started having kids.There’s a lot of vilifying of toads in pop culture. The whole thing about getting warts fromtoads, which of course you can’t.Alie: You can’t! They’re not viral! It’s just part of their back!Priya: Yeah. They’re just trying to protect themselves; they’re just trying to make sure that nobodyeats them, that’s all.Alie: And also, stop licking them if you don’t want to get any diseases!Priya [laughs] There are a lot worse things you can get from licking a toad, like salmonella amongother things.Aside: Among the other things is a strain of chlamydia, and a bunch of bacterial infections Ican’t pronounce. So, don’t lick toads! No one wants to get Toad Chlamydia. You wanna tell 12people you got Toad Chlamydia? Also, what is the state of the toad these days? How aretoads? Do they need us? Do they hate us?Alie: I know that cane toads are having a heyday, it is the Era of the Cane Toad, but how in generalare toads faring these days?Priya: It depends. So, some of the species of toads have been hit pretty hard by the chytrid fungus,the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, [“That’s quite a mouthful.”] orBD for short. In Central America especially, there’s a couple of the Atelopus genus speciesthat are thought to be extinct. There’s a golden toad that’s in the Incilius genus from CostaRica that was their iconic toad species, and they think that that’s extinct. [slowed down, sad,“Oh nooooo.”] I think they’ve found maybe a couple of individuals here and there of all thesedifferent species, but they’ve gone extinct and it’s because of this fungal pathogen.So, have you heard of white-nose in bats? This actually came before and the people in thewhite-nose world learned from that, but it took the BD world, the amphibian world, a reallylong time to figure out that it was this fungal pathogen. It was described as a new speciesonce they figured out that that’s what it was. It’s been responsible for… well, it’squestionable. But there’s a recent paper that says there’s like 500 species that have declinedthroughout the world because of BD. But there’s some question about that. Most people sayaround 200 or so species have declined or gone extinct specifically because of the impacts ofBD.And in the US in particular, some of our toad species have been the ones that have been mostimpacted. The boreal toads, like the Western toads, and there’s a Wyoming toad that’srelated as well. It just has a very small distribution in Wyoming and it’s also been impacted.And there’s all these recovery programs going on for these two toad species. They wereraising them in captivity and having good success with that but then when they put themback out in the habitat, they would die because this fungal pathogen remains in the habitat.So once it’s out there, it’s really hard to figure out how you can get them back out there. Sothey’re trying a bunch of different things to see how they can help them to persist with it.So, disease issues are something that has impacted our toads. There’re multiple strains thatare being documented now. There was an out-of-Asia and an out-of-Africa hypothesis thatwere competing for a while. I believe they have determined that it came out of Asia, butbecause of trade is why this thing is moving around. And with BD, they would use thoseAfrican clawed frogs. They’re fully aquatic, with claws. You’ll see them in Asian markets.They’re established in Los Angeles or somewhere down around there, in the wild, there’s apopulation down there and in a few other places in the US.Anyway, they were used as pregnancy tests. [“Wait. What?”] So, these are not toads, butthese frogs were used as pregnancy tests, and what they would do is they would have themin a doctor’s office and a woman who thought she was pregnant, they would take her urinesample and inject it into the frog, and if it laid eggs [Alie gasps] then she was pregnant. Andso of course after they were done with these frogs, they would just chuck them outside.Alie: Oh dear. Oh no.Priya: Yeah, and many of these… those obviously came from Africa, but they were carrying thisfungal pathogen, and apparently they’re resistant, or they can persist with it, and so theywere then spreading it to all the native species.Aside: So, this was an awful practice, but at the time it seemed favorable to the older way,which was injecting a live rabbit with prego-pee, waiting a couple of days, killing it, and then 13examining its ovaries. Or you could pee on wheat and see how long it takes to germinate. So,if you’re ever in a position to pee on a drug store stick, I guess just be glad you’re not waitingfor seeds to sprout. Or, like, actively murdering a bunny.Alie: Other than fungus and old timey pregnant ladies [Priya laughs] and like, really desperatePhish fans, what are the predators of toads?Priya: Oh, there are various birds and snakes that will eat toads. Hognose snakes are kind of toadspecialists. The toxin doesn’t seem to bother them, so they’re able to manage with them. Butcrows, which are super smart as you know, will eviscerate toads and then just eat theirgooey insides.Alie: That’s what I do with airport sandwiches. I just eat the middle.Priya: Right!! Exactly! [laughs] That’s what I do too, because I’ve been trying to not eat as muchbread anymore, so I just eat like the cheese and the veggies.Alie: Sometimes I’m like, “I’m gonna fall asleep if I eat this whole pretzel roll. I’m just going to eatthe inside.” Oh my god.Priya: So you eviscerate your sandwiches. It’s the same thing.Alie: So, they just unzip them in the belly and gobble them up?Priya: Pretty much. They just go for the soft part right there, and they just poke ‘em open.Sometimes you can see, it’s like a little shirt that’s been removed. I’ve seen some toads wherethey’ve pulled off the skin in such a way that it looks like they’re just stuck with their shirt upover their head. [laughs] And raccoons will do that a little bit sometimes, they’ll bite off thehead or the legs and then spit them out and then claw out or suck out the insides. So we’ll seethese half-eaten toads and stuff in the breeding season especially because they’re like,“Whoo! Smorgasbord here!”Alie: Oh my god, it’s like a shrimp buffet on a cruise ship. “Goin’ for it!”Priya: Exactly.Alie: Now, toads in pop culture. Are there any toads in movies?Priya: Oh, there’s this whole cane toad movie. Do you not know about this toad movie?Alie: No! What is it?Priya: It’s like, Attack of the Killer Toads or something. If you look it up you’ll find it, but it’s allabout these cane toads and it’s hilarious. It’s such a great classic B-movie.[clip from Cane Toads: An Unnatural History. Australian male voice: “When I’m driving the carI have no hesitation in running over them whatsoever.” Australian female voice: “I couldn’t dothat. They’re friends.” ominous organ music.]Aside: So, she’s talking, I think, about the very cheesy 1988 documentary Cane Toads: AnUnnatural History, which I would very, very much like to just kick back and watch. Thesecane toads, man. Whoo! I had no idea.Priya: Cane toads are the biggest toads, and I think the record is 3 pounds or something like that.Alie: [laughing] It’s an absolute unit of toad!Priya: Yeah. Completely.Alie: Would you ever keep a toad as a pet?14Priya: No, you know everybody asks me that and I never have.Aside: So, no. No pet toads for Priya. She prefers to see them hopping about and justenjoying the wild, having their orgies, one of which was recently captured as 10 cane toadsat once were riding a python bareback in Australia. It looked like toads on the subway, homefrom work, but what was really happening was not commuting. The python just didn’t havethat release call chirp, if you know what I’m saying.But let’s say you’d like to have more outdoor pals, and you’re not a python. How can youmake your backyard a haven for toads?Alie: So, you turned over a pot in the garden and then did you carve out a little toad door?Priya: No, they have this stuff at the nature centers, like these little guidance type things, but youcan bury a pot halfway so that it becomes a little tunnel. You can find these little designs thatare out there for these little toad homes and they even make actual terracotta toad homes.Aside: So, do yourself one favor today, and look up the hashtag #ToadAbodes. Oh, what asight. What a sight for sad hearts. Just all kinds of pottery in the shape of mushroom houses,toad roadhouses, little ceramic cottages for warty locals. Several times a day since seeingthat, I just stare off and I think of all the toads in aaalll the little houses all over the world,taking a snooze.All right, let’s pepper Priya with some questions.Alie: Are you ready for Patreon questions?Priya: I think so.Aside: But before I ask the questions that you submitted, patrons, a few quick messagesabout sponsors of the show who make it possible for us to make a donation each week to acause of the Ologist’s choosing. This week Priya requested a donation be made to theAmphibian and Reptile Conservancy to support inclusivity and diversity initiatives inamphibian and reptile conservations. So thank you, Priya.Also, if you like Ologies, I think you would dig a podcast called Gastropod. I don’t know if youhave heard about it, but it’s about the science and history of food and it’s hosted by twolovely women and I just want to give them a shout. They go on these deep dives into themost curious topics. They visit the world’s most advance model gut at dinner time, they takeyou on a quest to figure out where microbes in sourdough come from. They figure outwhether science can speed up the very magical process of aging whiskey. So in short, they’rejust obsessed with finding surprising science behind the food we eat every day. You can findGastropod and subscribe to it on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever you get yourpodcasts. We just thought that you guys might like each other. Okay, sponsors.[Ad Break]Your questions:Alie: Patreon questions. We got a ton.Priya: Really!?Alie: Yes!Priya: That quickly?15Alie: Patrons are the best! Jack Kelleher asks: Life cycle of a toad; same as, similar to a frog? Or dothey live longer or shorter than a frog, do you think?Priya: Well, I think it depends on the species. Some frogs live pretty long, some toads live prettylong, but on average sort of 5ish, 7ish, 10ish range of years. But life cycle, fairly similar to afrog, because you know, they are frogs.Alie: They are a frog.Priya: So, they will mostly be on land until it’s breeding season, or they’ll be hibernating orwhatever, and then they’ll come to the ponds for that breeding season, and they’ll call, attracttheir mate. There are some toads that don’t call and… Oh! There are some toads that will dothat leg waving thing? Have you ever seen that?Alie: What?!Priya: In these stream environments where it’s so loud because of all the stream noise, they haveevolved this… They literally take their back leg and they just go like this.Aside: Priya, by the way, is laying on the hotel room bed, doing a move that looks like partsynchronized swimming but also part shipwreck victim.Priya: And I think in some of them it’s their front leg too, or their arm? And they’re like, “Hey! I’mover here!” [laughs]Alie: Oh my god. Like hailing a cab!Priya: Yes! And then some, chick toad is like walking by and she’s like, “Oh. OH! I see you.”Alie: [laughs] I never knew that they did that!Priya: Anyway, I digressed there. So, generally speaking they attract their mate, the female comesover and they, you know, do the deed, and they have mostly external fertilization, there’s acouple of exceptions. And then they lay their eggs and most of the species lay a lot of eggs.Maybe you’ll have a pretty decent amount of the eggs that’ll hatch into tadpoles but then thetadpoles are food for all sorts of stuff. [“Mmmm. Delicious!”] Have you ever seen all the littletoadlets popping out of…Alie: Are they really called toadlets?Priya: Yes! Toadlets!Alie: Oh god!Priya: And they’re soooo tiny, but they’re just the cutest frickin’ things.Alie: Frédéric Roy wants to know: Are there any studies on the possible medical applications oftoad toxins?Priya: Yes. I don’t know the details of them, but I know there’s some study on how it affects heartrates. There’s kind of a steroidal element to it, and I think in the cocktail there’s alsoepinephrine components. In animals, and other things that have experienced the toxincoming into contact with the toads, they have these extended periods of fast heart rate, orsometimes they have a really slowed heart rate, and so they’re studying maybe there’s a wayto hone that in. There’s some cool stuff going on with that.Aside: PS, I gave a quick google just to make sure and yup, sure thing; plenty of researchgoing on about toad toxins and inflammatory agents, cardiac activity regulators and anticancer agents, so the future is toads.16Alie: I’d love to see a prescription pad that just said, “Toad.”Priya: “Toad. Lick toad. Two licks a day.”Alie: Heather Albrecht says: What are toad communities like? I always see toads on the ground,blazing their own trails, but then there’s always another little guy not too far away. Do theyreconvene at the end of the day in communal housing if they survive my lawnmower? Or dothey battle it out for prime resources? Do they have friends, do you think?Priya: They all come together for the breeding season, but they’re not really, like, friendly. They’reall competing during that time. And it is true that you do tend to see them together, and Ithink that is probably because they must hang out together wherever they’re overwinteringor hanging out during the hot months or something.Alie: Maybe they’re in the same hibernaculum which is my new favorite word ever. I’m like…literally, I’m going to get a sign for the bedroom, just call it The Hibernaculum.Priya: Yes! It’s the perfect name for the bedroom.Alie: Jana May Purington wants to know: Why does everyone think toads are so much grosserthan frogs?Priya: I don’t know. That is such a good question. I think it’s because of the warts. People just think,“Oh gross, it’s all warty,” and they don’t want to touch it. But if you just actually look at a toadface, I mean, they’re just so cute!Alie: So expressive.Priya: So expressive, and you kind of know where they stand and I love that.Alie: Toads do not suffer fools.Priya: They do not suffer fools, yeah.Alie: Ira Gray wants to know: Why do toads pee on me when I pick them up?Priya: Oh, yeah. It happens all the time. I’ve gotten so much toad pee on me. It’s just a defensemechanism. They’re like, “Hey maybe if I pee on you, you’ll let me go.”Aside: I mean, who hasn’t tried that in a meeting you wanted to leave?Priya: Just from sitting in a little puddle of water or something, they can absorb up enough water.Unless it’s been really dry, you don’t have to worry too much about it. But if you’re finding atoad out in the middle of the woods, and you pick it up, and then it pees on you, then youmight have made its life a little bit harder for a little while.Alie: Give it a little capful of water and let it just sit.Priya: Yeah just pour a little bit of your water into a little bowl and just plop it in there, let it just[slurps] reabsorb some water. [laughs]Alie: I love that they do that! Sarah Terry wants to know: What do you think is the most poisonousone ever?Priya: That’s a good question because there’s different toxin cocktails in these bufotoxins. I thinkthe cane toad is pretty toxic. I don’t know if it’s the most toxic, though. That’s a goodquestion. But I know that that genus, that Rhinella genus, I think a lot of those have prettystrong toxins. I think the Incilius maybe does too, and that’s the genus of the Sonoran Deserttoad, the one that is the hallucinogenic one.17Aside: Shoot, I don’t think I’ve said this yet, but: Don’t Lick Toads.Alie: Sarah Peck would like to know if you know any toad related magic spells? [laughs] I’m sureyou know so many!Priya: So, in Macbeth, that saying double toil and trouble poem? At the beginning of it, it talks abouta toad and like ‘put that in the pot first’. [clip: A witch from Macbeth reciting, “Toad, thatunder cold stone. Days and nights has thirty-one.”] They’re basically trying to get the toadtoxin into their little witch’s brew. But I’m sure there are other toad poems. I don’t knowother toad poems.Alie: I’m gonna look up some toad witch spells. I’m sure there’s a ton.Aside: So, I just did a little tippy-tapping, and according to some very helpful occultwebsites, during medieval times toads were seen as satanic creatures. Folks thought thatwitches could, like, magically cosplay as toads, and then go poison people, and just causegeneral toad-related mayhem.Although now that I’m thinking about it, that Disney frog prince fairy tale of a woman kissinga frog and then turning it into some well-groomed and presumably fiscally stable man, wasmaybe just a parable about a hallucination. Who knows? Moving on.Alie: Alpecapaca wants to know: Is there a humane way to get rid of cane toads, or nah?Priya: [sighs] Yeah, probably the most humane way is if you could just collect them all up andfreeze them or something. Like, slowly turn the temperature down until they freeze. I don’tknow.Alie: They’d just go to sleep-sleep, right?Priya: Just go to sleep. There’s this thing that we used to use, when we were getting ready topreserve critters for pickle jars, it’s this stuff called MS-222, which I think is regulateddifferently now. But it’s kind of a cocaine relative, and you would sprinkle a little bit in a jarof water and you’d put the toad or frog or whatever in and after a little while, [relaxed sigh].So if you put in more, then it’ll feel that way just before it dies, and so then it’s kind of apeaceful death. But you probably couldn’t do that very easily with… especially the canetoads, as big as they are, you’d have to get like big vats.Alie: You’d have to literally get like…Priya: … piles and piles, kilos of MS-222.Alie: You’d need a dealer. Laura Kinney wants to know: Do toads travel far from their burrow, orwhatever a toad home is called, to forage or find a mate? How’s their commute? What’s atoad commute like?Priya: You now, generally speaking, it's thought they don’t move that far. But there was recently…one of my colleagues in Utah was tracking these Western toads, and found that they movedlike 5 or 6 miles, which, for a toad that hops? That’s a long-ass way! Between where theirbreeding site was and where they were hanging out in the winter… because they’ll go back tothe same ponds where they emerged to go breed.And so, when those habitats got fewer and farther between, if they went back and their pondthat they know was not there, they’ll usually go just a little bit further until they find the nextthing. So probably over time, these animals have developed the ability to go that far. Andespecially the ones in these montane habitats, there are a lot fewer areas, and a lot moreground to traverse between ponds.18That was one that I remember was pretty striking. I just learned that a couple of years ago,that those particular ones were able to do that. I’m pretty sure that there’s nothing in theliterature that suggests that they go that far.Alie: Do they have a homing device? How are they finding the same ponds?Priya: I think they believe it’s a little bit both astrological as well as chemo-sensory, and they’reable to smell their home ponds, basically, and go back. That’s true of a lot of amphibians ingeneral, they tend to go back to the same sites, and actually a lot of reptiles as well. Theyhave site-fidelity.Alie: Oh, I didn’t know that’s what it was called! Megan Luschen asks: In your opinion what type oftoad has the most beautiful mating call?Priya: Oh man.Alie: And says: Some of the best sleep I’ve ever had took place in a little cabin in northernWisconsin and I specifically remember the toad songs being extremely calming.Priya: I do really love the American toad call. It’s just that long trill, it’s so pretty. Have you heard it?Alie: No!Aside: Priya offered to do a toad trill, and I said, “Yes please.”Priya: [imitates toad trill, like an extended old- fashioned telephone ring, but not annoying. Priyalaughs and Alie applauds]That one is a very soothing one. There’s another relative, the Woodhouse’s toad, or theFowler’s toad, they sound like a woman or a child being murdered, seriously. I have been outin the woods with other herpetologists and we were like, “Oh my god! There’s a woman introuble!” [A woman’s – er, a Woodhouse toad’s – high-pitched scream] And we’re like, “Oh no,shit. That’s just a Fowler’s toad.”Alie: Oh my god! Just horror toads!Priya: So those are the not soothing ones.Alie: In all of this praise of toads, something’s gotta suck. They’ve gotta be a dick to someone.What is wrong with a toad? There’s got to be something you dislike about toads or about,just in general, toading? [Priya laughs] Toad trippin’.Priya: I think the worst quality of a toad is that they just… they try to be so tough. Like, just admit it.You’re just a soft little sweet thing. Just admit it! [Alie laughs] This is, again, like where myromantic life comes into play. [laughs] But like, I know you’re trying to be all tough andbadass, , but you’re not, you’re not all that tough and badass! Just be soft! It’s okay thatyou’re soft! I see your soft belly; it’s all good. [“All right, Mr. Tough Guy.”]Alie: What about the fact that you got sexually assaulted by a toad!?Priya: Oh yeah, they’re pretty aggressive.Alie: I love that that’s so forgivable. It’s like, okay.Priya: [laughs] No, that’s pretty bad. You’re right. What else, though?Alie: Well the toxins, but what about when you’re out toad hunting? Are you out there in themiddle of the night? Are you sloppin’ around in boots?19Priya: Oh yeah. In boots, at night, headlamp, trying to take the females’ heads out of the water sothat they don’t die.Alie: When you’re out froggin’ and toadin’ at night, and you’re in hip waders and boots, do youbring along a thermos of hot tea or anything? What are the creature comforts out there?Priya: You know, once it gets to be around toad season, the nights are relatively warm, or at leastthey were out in Maryland. So, it’s kind of nice being out at night, those warmish nights.There were definitely some days… one of my friends and I, in grad school we wouldn’t evenwear boots. There were these mucky ponds that we would just take off the waders becausethey would get stuck in the muck, and we would go barefoot and in shorts, and just becomeone with the toads. They would be all around you, and other frogs and stuff too, and you’dsee things swimming in the water, like turtles.Alie: And now, did we say a favorite thing about a toad? So hard to pick. Do you have a favoritething? The one thing about a toad that you love the most? Or about your job as a herper?Priya: Oh, what is my favorite thing about a toad? I don’t know? I just love their little bodies, thatlittle classic toad shape, and the little hop, and the face, just that little classic toad face. You’regonna get all these comments afterwards, like, “Oh my god! I can’t believe she didn’t sayanything about this shitty that a toad does.”Oh my god! But speaking of that though, they do pee, but you have to look up a toad pooping.[]Alie: What’s the deal?Priya: They have the biggest shit. They poop out these logs that are seriously, like, a third to a halfof their body length. I’m telling you; it is the craziest thing. I’ve only seen it once, in the wild,but videos, yeah. You have to google that. [Alie can’t stop laughing]Aside: Oh, of course I looked this up.Priya: I think that they just eat a lot in one sitting, and then they hop around, and then all of asudden, the one that I saw, it just started doing this weird crunching thing, kind of like a dogthat’s ready to poop? And then all of a sudden it was like, “Oh my god! It’s pooping!” and thenthis thing kept fucking coming out and it was this huge-ass shit. Yeah, you have to see. [Alie isstill laughing and Priya laughs]Aside: Ohboyohboyohboy! Okay, I guess if you take nothing else away from this episode,it’s just that toads make turds. I of course sought out video proof, and was instantlyfurnished with some YouTube gems, such as one titled, “Toad Pooping a Giant Turd.”[clip from “Toad Pooping a Giant Turd”: three voices exclaiming and laughing]“Look at the size of that load, man!”“It’s a big turd!”“My god, dude!”“He’s having trouble”“It’s like he’s laborin’ it out! It’s almost like he’s giving birth or something!”And yet another small film, called “Toad Taking a Massive Shit.” [female voice, in disbelief:“How can one toad poop so much?”]20It’s an impossible seeming volume. In a human scale, you would easily need a second toilet.Let’s move on. []Alie: You are my favorite bufologist. [Priya laughs] You’re my favorite toad-lover on the planet.Priya: [laughs] I’m the only one you know, aren’t I?Alie: That is true. But you’re also my favorite.
