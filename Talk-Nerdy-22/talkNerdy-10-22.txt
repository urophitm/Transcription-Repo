Hello everyone and welcome to Talk Nerdy. Today is Monday, February 10, 2020, and I'm the host of the show, Cara Santa Maria. And before we dive into the show, I want to thank those of you who have made Talk Nerdy possible this week. The top patrons on Patreon, and remember, you can always pledge your support by going to patreon.com slash Talk Nerdy. The top patrons this week include Mary Neva and her son, I think Jim, yeah. Pasquale Gelati Sinai, Ulrika Hagman, Dutus Infanitas, the zombie drummer, Phil Tiber, Brian Holden, Daniel Lang, and David J. Eastmith. Thank you all so, so much. It's because of you that the show keeps on going, especially on weeks where I don't sell any ads, like this week. So we're just going to go straight on through with the episode. Okay, guys, this one's pretty fascinating. So I sat down with two individuals this week, Paul Kwit Kowski, who is the Wildlife Conservation and Sustainability Manager at Mount Auburn Cemetery, along with Dr. Maria Aliberty Lubertazi, who is an adjunct faculty member at Rhode Island School of Design, and also an environmental scientist specializing in wetland and urban ecology. She is actually collaborating with Mount Auburn Cemetery on biodiversity, research, and education. So between Paul and Maria, we chat about the really cool urban ecology citizen science projects that are happening at a cemetery at Mount Auburn. So yeah, guys, you're going to be so fascinated because I know I was. Without any further ado, here they are, Paul Kwit Kowski and Dr. Maria Aliberty, Lubertazi. Well, Paul and Maria, thank you so much for joining me today. It's good to be with you, Cara. Thank you. All right, so I love it when I get to do an interview that's a three-person interview. It's not common, and that's mostly because of the constraints of my setup. My show has always been a one-on-one show, which means that I'd have two microphones, and I only have the potential to record with one other person. But we've managed to hack it and make it work. So it's going to be really fun to get the insights from both of you as we chat today. All right, so let's talk urban ecology, wetland ecology, urban wildlife. Specifically, this was so exciting to me when I first heard that we would have the opportunity to chat specifically in a cemetery. So, Paul, you are the wildlife conservation and sustainability manager at Mount Auburn Cemetery. Is that a typical title? Do most cemeteries have a wildlife conservation and sustainability focus? As far as I know, I may be the only wildlife conservation and sustainability manager in the United States at a cemetery. That's incredible. And so, okay, number one, how does one get that job? And number two, what is it about Mount Auburn that this is a special project or special program that's happening at this specific cemetery? Well, when I came to Mount Auburn as an intern back in 1999, I had been studying urban ecology and college. And I was interning in the Horticulture Department here, but my true interest was in urban ecology. So, I just over a period of years kind of developed and created my own niche, trying to educate people about the importance of urban ecology and how the cemetery is much more than just an active cemetery or an arboretum, but we're also one of the largest green spaces in this urban environment. So, eventually, there was enough interest in some of the programs and projects that I was initiating that the cemetery was gracious enough to create the position of wildlife conservation and sustainability manager. And you guys are located kind of right in the middle of the city in Cambridge, Massachusetts, right? Well, we're actually on the Watertown Cambridge line. The majority of the cemetery is in Watertown, but both areas are really built up urban areas. The metropolitan Boston area, but we're close to the Boston, so we're in the inner part of that. We're across the river, the Charles River from Boston. Gotcha. Yeah, so when I'm looking on like Google Maps right now at your location, it's obviously a large kind of green patch on the map, but it's surrounded by development. Yes. Fascinating. Okay, so you have kind of your own ecology that exists within that green space. And of course, Maria to bring you in here, you are an environmental scientist and you're kind of collaborating with Mount Auburn, kind of working on this wetland ecology, urban ecology, project, and also citizen science, right? Yes, it's multifaceted. Yes, so this will be my fifth year doing research here at Mount Auburn. This whole research and citizen scientist thing has been developing, evolving over the last, would you say, seven or eight years or less than that? Well, our citizen science program began five years ago, but before that, we had various bio and diversity researchers that had implemented projects here at Mount Auburn, and we wanted to expand and build upon those efforts. And so one thing that's very important to understand very special about Mount Auburn cemetery is its history. And it's an addition to being this big green space. It also has many famous people buried here and architectural and our bore cultural elements to it. So people of all from all different backgrounds and interests visit this cemetery. But in addition to that, Paul, I wish I knew more about this, but there's a lot of data on birds at this cemetery for how 100 years or something. Yeah, more. Yes. Mount Auburn has been designated as one of the 79 important birding sites by the Mass Audubon Society. And so every spring, we are swarmed by birders to that follow the spring migration. And so that is one key component of what we're pursuing in our citizen science projects. We have a breeding bird survey which was implemented last year. And essentially, we have an ecologist named Burke's Mathucin who leads a group of citizen scientists to 16 different points out on the cemetery grounds where they stop at each point and they essentially conduct a point count survey. veteran owned and operated the bearded Viking meat crew is reinventing the ancient art of meat making with a modern twist.

And the main thing they're looking for is to identify birds that not only that they see in here, but that are demonstrating breeding behavior such as collecting twigs to make nests or they may be bringing food back to young or actually feeding young in the nest. So this is a kind of built upon years upon years of the birders recording their observations. Not only here on a birding board we have, but now as technology has advanced, they record their observations to e-bird. That's really cool. So I mean I guess maybe I don't know taking a step back. Some people who are listening right now might be like wait what you're doing like ecology and citizen science work at a cemetery? Like how does this even happen? But of course a cemetery is a large green space right? Like this is an area that is often maintained and that is just naturally going to attract whatever the urban wildlife in this region might be. Is that correct? Is that a good way to look at this? Absolutely and it might be helpful if I gave you a little more background before Maria really steps deeper into her area of expertise if you don't mind? Absolutely. Okay so Mount Auburn was consecrated in 1831 and we are recognized as America's first guarded cemetery and our founders were well aware of the importance of sustainability even back then they tried to plan the cemetery in a fashion that could sustain wildlife. So we were still an act of cemetery to this day but we're also an arboretum. And we've had as I mentioned earlier we've had biodiversity researchers conducting various research projects here over the years but those were mostly related to our amphibian residents here and so some years ago I thought that it was probably a good time to reach out to additional researchers so that we could expand on learning about what was here and also bring the community closer to nature because for many folks our green space is where people go to get outdoors because many of them live in apartments or condos or they live in houses with posted stamp yards and they don't have really the opportunity to spend a lot of time amongst a woodland setting or amongst water bodies without being crowded out by many other visitors at that that same site. So we developed a citizen science program and we currently have eight studies that are incorporated in this this program. So we started with a phonology study in which we have volunteers that go out and observe 10 species of deciduous trees and shrubs around the grounds for a total of 64 specimens and in the spring they record things such as blood burst, leaves unfolding, flowers open and the reason for this is we're trying to determine the life cycle, the timing of life cycle stages in relationship to weather and climate because we need to know are as the birds are migrating north are these specimens of trees and shrubs are their leaves and flowers open at the same time as the birds are arriving and as the insects are emerging so that the birds have a food source or as the climate warms is everything happening earlier and are the birds able to time their migration to arrive when the food sources are available. So that's a very important long-term study and it was our initial effort. We have 125 citizen scientists that have been trained for this program. So it's been a great success 2020 will be our fifth year of data collection and in the fall the same citizen scientists walk the same route on the grounds to observe leaf color change, leaf drop and fruit and seed drop as well. We also expanded our amphibian monitoring which began as monitoring our spotted salamander population here into observing some of our other amphibians and reptiles and what we found was we really didn't have great diversity in amphibians and reptiles and part of that may have been to habitat destruction because we are an active cemetery and we do still bury people here but also years ago some very dangerous chemicals were used in the water culture field and so we could have lost populations to that. So we determined that it was appropriate to reintroduce native species that at one time most likely were here. So we've reintroduced American toads, gray tree frogs and spring peepers and that was led by a wetlands ecologist named Joe Martinez and now we currently have three breeding populations of all of well we have breeding populations of all three of those species now. So one of the dramatic changes is that where the cemetery was quiet in the spring now you can come in and you can hear you know the American toads trilling and the spring peepers peeping and it really adds that extra bonus and improves the experience of visiting Mount Arburn. So that's a win-win for us and for the public as well. Uh, no, say, and it just like just to point out that the spotted salamanders are a kind of a very specialized and somewhat rare species and the fact that their population stayed here since 1831 it maintains a species that so I don't know out out your way whether you hear about vernel pools. It's a type of wetland. Okay. That fills in the spring with water and then dries out by the end of the summer and one particular thing is that they're usually in in wooded areas and that they're usually there's no fish. There cannot be fish living there and so a whole suite of species both vertebrate and invertebrate specialize in being able to live and reproduce in those habitats and the fact that those spotted salamanders are still here is pretty amazing. I love that. That's really cool. It's like something that probably, you know, folks who obviously wouldn't take the time or haven't had the opportunity to come visit or to read about these things may never know that they're these, like you said, these kind of rareish creatures that not only live right next store but have been thriving next door for over a hundred years.

Correct. Correct. Yes. It was actually through Joe Martinez who's at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology where I've done research in urban ecology and I also teach in urban ecology course and I connected him when I heard about his work at Mount Auburn both monitoring the spotted salamander population and also doing this reintroduction of these three amphibian species and I had him come and speak to my class and and and and talking with him more. I was like wow I'd love to oh there are ponds there I study ponds and so it was through Joe that I connected with Paul and what so what do I study specifically I do a lot of different things but my my doctoral work from my PhD was looking at dragonfly populations on an urban to rural gradient in Rhode Island. Okay so urban to rural gradient so from more populated areas to less populated areas. More populated by humans and built up. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay and did you find that there are massive differences between those two areas? Okay so I have to explain something first is that dragonfly adults are beautiful but that's not what I study. I study the dragonflies juvenile stage which some people call larvae but technically they're called nymphs. Okay and they live in the water. They live in the water for one to three or four years depending on the species before the nymph climbs out of the water it's exoskeleton cracks open and the adult pulls itself out and then if it's lucky and not eaten by a bird it flies away so it leaves behind that exoskeleton and that's what I study is I collect exoskeletons of dragonfly nymphs which are called exuvier and by collecting those I can do a survey over the course of the whole season because certain things come out at different times along the seasonal along the seasonal path right so I collect those and I then identify them in the lab so then what I have is a data set of which species of dragonfly successfully emerged from this body of water so that's what I used for my doctoral work and I looked at I studied the whole state of Rhode Island but I really had a lot of urban sites including urban cemetery sites in Rhode Island and so when I connected with Joe and then I was like wow I want to know more about this I had never been even to Monomer and I live not far from here actually embarrassingly but so that's really interesting you were basically as part of your doctoral research you did survey some sites where like cemetery sites but my assumption is that those cemetery sites didn't have active ongoing research projects like Mount Auburn does absolutely not however one of them currently does have a I don't know if I he's not really researcher but he's a really bringing the cemetery ises in Providence to light of environmental circles and so he's just a great voice and with regard to that but no that's correct I usually had to just ask permission and there was maybe one person that worked there if that it's interesting because it ostensibly like it makes perfect sense that a cemetery environment would especially one with an active arboretum like you know with so much urban ecology would be a place to for environmental stewardship a place for wildlife management and of course a place where you could study some of these populations in great detail because it's something of a controlled environment like it makes perfect sense to me sitting here across the across the internet from you but I wonder if from just kind of like an emotional gut reaction perspective the first reaction from a lot of people is like oh a cemetery or like uh science at a cemetery I don't know well it's it's funny that you should say that because we have this conversation quite often and typically the people's first responses you do that there I had no idea you could do that at a cemetery and we we've you know we take very seriously our role in the community as educators and as being leaders for sustainability so we have uh gone to great lengths to try to preserve our woodland areas and protect our water bodies but also to create more naturalized areas that at one time we're much more ornamental oh just so like lawns and like maybe plants that didn't naturally grow there but we're just to look pretty for people exactly so but being an an active cemetery there are expectations for what people think the cemetery should be and so we we do work with law donors and with the public to try to explain the reasons behind some of the changes we're making and we and you know we try to meet people at a certain point so that you know people's expectations are met while we still are protecting and expanding habitat for wild ones yeah yeah that makes sense um it does seem like a funny thing where my assumption would be um and maybe correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not sure if you actually do this kind of interfacing but I'm sure some people at the at the institution do my assumption would be that even like the families who come to visit their loved ones are people who are laid to rest there that if they're informed and educated about what the projects are and if they really think about them it's a win-win right it's about um it's about providing and maintaining a really beautiful really natural habitat that for organisms to thrive and that's actually creates a more um uplifting experience for everybody when they go to visit but initially I wonder if there's some pushback or if there if you have to deal with any sort of like we I don't want people to come visit a cemetery where my loved ones are laid to rest to see birds or like I don't I don't know if I feel comfortable with there being all this other science going on it's really just should be here for my you know for grandma well I would say the more of the pushback we we have is towards uh expanding naturalized areas oh it's amazing ornamental because that's that's more of the expectation of visitors and law donors of what a traditional cemetery is so people may may agree with what we're doing and say they they appreciate it but often they may say something like yeah I you know I want there to be habitat here at the cemetery for wildlife but I don't want it by my law but one of the the really interesting things we found is as more people become aware of our efforts and environmental stewardship um they are embracing it in fact uh one of our salespeople told me last week that she was out looking at lot space with a family and they saw one of our uh our uh signs that for our uh breeding bird survey which are very attractive numbered signs on stakes that we try to tuck into the uh you know to the surrounding landscape so that they don't look out of place but so that our citizen scientists know exactly this is Lisa Brady owner of Lisa's Pain Body Shop if you're in an accident don't be afraid to

prohibitive visit moto.us by mortatales it's time clear where to go and when they when this family saw that sign they were like oh my gosh I want to be buried near uh this location where I know people will keep coming in to learn about birds and protecting environment so I you know I think people's perspectives you know are changing and a lot of people are thinking more long term uh than ever before especially in the face of the warming climate yeah it seems like especially in the face of the warming climate and this kind of change and we'll dive into that too with respect to some of your longitudinal citizens science but also I think in in in the face of the fact that we do have an exploding population and you know if we want to be able to continue to bury people underground we're going to have to think think about how we're utilizing cemetery space you know it's it takes up a large percentage of the ground and if like you said it's only utilized for ornamental and like really manicured um locations it's actually encroaching and has been historically for a very long time encroaching on the habitat of wildlife you know in order to build a cemetery and of course Mount Auburn has been around for quite a while but if you need to build a new cemetery you're probably not going to tear down buildings that once existed you're probably going to go into a wild area unfortunately and level out the ground and plant some grass and then start putting in graves and it does seem like there's a way to maintain a wild um or maybe I should say a managed wild population and like kind of have the best of both worlds and still have a place where where loved ones can be buried and people can come to visit them I'd actually rather visit as you said a plot that's surrounded by trees and birds and insects and the sounds of frogs and the sounds of wildlife then just like a grass field that goes on as far as the eye can see. Yeah no I think I think things are changing I mean obviously this was a new a novel thing that you were told about Paul but I think yeah I think people's perspectives are changing and um oh as far as land use and decisions on that um it's hard to hard to know um and then in different regions of the country in the world it's going to be different on how people how decisions are made about that too I think right yeah and obviously I know that that um as environmental scientists and and you know organizers of these projects your role is not a political one about how do we bury bodies in this country and you know what do we do what are the death decisions that we can make that are more natural but you know the fact is that is happening anyway so how can we make the best of the fact that there are these massive cemeteries and maybe I mean I hope that the projects that you guys are doing could be inspirational for other cemeteries to help understand how they can contribute as well I think about Los Angeles I live here in in you know very urban center but in urban center where we're very proud of our urban ecology and urban wildlife efforts um you know we have beautiful parks in the middle of of the city with where I think we're the only um we're the only city in the world other than Mumbai so there are two cities in the world that have a big cat population in the urban centers um because because we have um you know pumas that live in the city um and that are maintained within our our our mountain areas um and and there are like even next to Griffith Park there are these massive massive cemeteries and it's you know like the animal populations that I see in some of these cemeteries are um peacocks you know like I don't think those were naturally living there I think they put them in um or like doves or ducks in the pond which is great but it does feel very ornamental to me and it would be cool to see a little bit of that kind of quote unquote rewilding of some of these spaces yeah absolutely and uh you know and to make the case uh you know to to continue to try to uh expand or improve on wildlife habitat while still maintaining the the general character of the cemetery um we uh we decided to take a look at uh you know wildlife and habitat uh in the big picture so we did uh aquatic surveys of the wildlife that we had in in our ponds in our Vernal Pool we did terrestrial surveys and that gave us some baseline data which then in turn helped us to develop a citizen science naturalist program and so within this program uh volunteers can learn about mammals and insects and amphibians and reptiles and birds uh we also offer intro to plant identification and botany as well as field notes and nature photography and also uh a training on the use of the iNaturalist app and uh on becoming informal educators to the public so it's a really well-rounded program and Maria actually co leads the insect training every year which has been a great success and um the participants uh in in this program though they will attend classroom trainings uh late winter early spring and then they can volunteer to become research assistant uh throughout the summer and fall for projects such as Maria's work and so we have also um since i've been researching here we've also there's also been uh as a woman studying um ant populations here and uh butterfly and moth populations correct um so currently as far as the invertebrates go that's what right well well we uh we have um uh a faculty member from Leslie University named Amy Myrtle who is uh she is leading an orthropods study which is um essentially the caterpillars count program which was developed out of the University of North Carolina and that is um you know essentially the uh the protocol for that is the volunteers will look at the undersides of leaves uh for orthropods uh and also for for damage from those orthropods and this this uh effort is coincides with our phenology effort because of course many of these orthropods are consumed by the migratory birds as they're they're moving their way north uh Amy also leads a pollinator study in which uh uh volunteers will photograph uh pollinators visiting the perennial gardens on the grounds uh and documenting through through photography what is visiting uh each individual uh plant so she can determine uh you know what pollinators are are here and when are when they're arriving and from that we can you know then really take a look at our plant collections to see if we're meeting the needs of pollinators by having enough uh marvel host plants enough plants that could be food sources or plants yeah for nectarine and also uh you know in general we want to look at our plant collections so that we know that you know we have enough breeding ground and cover for for any of our wildlife species here that makes sense um when you if you were to add up all of the different projects and programs that are going on from a scientific perspective kind of underneath that umbrella not just the citizen science programs even though it does seem like that's a large percentage of the work that you do how many

that switch to one a key uh i'm happening at any given time uh well we we had nine different projects in 2019 wow okay and and were they all citizen science projects or just some of them eight of the nine had eight of the nine had a component mm-hmm all of the biodiversity researchers that i've you know tried to you know recruit or have reached out to me to see if they could pursue you know their interest here um you know these these efforts were all they were all led by individual researchers and because i was developing a citizen science program i reached out to each each researcher to see if we could accommodate their research by having research assistants uh in the form of citizen scientist kind of just jump in and assist with their work and also learn about their work and gain you know the experience of being closer to nature sure and i i guess that that leads me to to some a need for a little bit of clarification about how the citizens and scientists in each of these different programs and i'm assuming there's some variability what is their commitment like do you have people who sign up and who are really in it and who are working like most days of the week or do you sometimes have people who are coming to the cemetery just to walk the grounds who read about oh while i'm here today i could just count some things yeah i'd love to do that as part of my daily you know stroll well well we um we uh uh promote we well first we create the curriculum and then we uh promote it to the public via our website uh and other social media platforms and then through just posters at like local libraries or making uh local teachers aware of what uh you know what some of the opportunities here at Mount Auburn are um and the way it generally works because our citizens scientists are all volunteers uh we we kind of we have different expectations for each biodiversity research project so for instance for the phonology study we ask that people visit the cemetery once a week and we broke down our phonology trail into three sections so that each section could be done in about 45 minutes that way that way if people are on their lunch break they might just walk one section yeah or if they have more time they can do two sections or the entire trail uh some people come more than once a week and some people can't quite make it every week um but that is the ideal for us is that we have consistent data collection uh with this effort um and some of the other projects uh folks again we you know we try to have them come on a regular basis but each project is a little different and sometimes things are coordinated um on the availability of the of the biodiversity researcher themselves for instance we have a faculty member from Leslie uh university and he also works for Boston University his name is Chris Richardson and he is he's undertaken an urban bat study at Mount Auburn so he will have volunteers join him here quite late at night which is a much different experience than the citizen scientists who are here you know visiting in the mornings for the phonology or the author pot studies uh yeah so it gives those volunteers a really unique experience at Mount Auburn coming back to to the work that you're doing Maria um you know when you're in specifically with your collaboration at Mount Auburn we talked a little bit about how you first how you first got involved but now that you are involved in an ongoing capacity are you working on a specific project are you working with Paul on kind of doing some of the more like I don't know what you would call it architecture of some of the ongoing projects like how has your role um evolved okay uh so I've been working here now for four years okay um and what I'm doing like the overall overall thing that I'm doing is I want to um I'm studying the dragon flag the emerging dragonfly community at the four wetlands um on the property okay um I started um four years ago uh just doing uh I'm just gonna go see every couple weeks kind of thing so a small little just to take a look and then um so that was the first year and then the the the following three years um I've been sampling every week during the whole field season so ideally late may through late September and this last year um so well I started out sampling two of the ponds on the property um and this last year so my fourth year um was my fourth year sampling those two ponds but then I added the other two ponds to look and so I'm looking at at the dragonfly community that is completing its life cycle and emerging from the ponds I might also look at the adults flying around too but um so um I've also starting two years ago we did a little pilot project with the citizen science um program to see could we do this could this work um and and and so then the following year which was uh last field season I had two volunteers who stuck with it through the whole coming weekly um doing a similar survey to what I do but on a different in a different place and I'll explain the one of the factors is that so the demographics of the volunteers um change and vary like just like what Paul was saying people who want to come at certain times of the day or available at certain times of the day but like for for survey for collecting dragonfly exuvia you needed to agree of um physical um mobility to access getting into the water usually yeah yeah um navigating through the water and uh the plants in the water and that sort of thing and so that's uh that's something to definitely um the definitely um plays a role in my um in my project now the team that has um the citizen scientist team that has has done this for me um really well last year and even the year before they are two of them and they do it together and so the whole complementing each other in in multiple ways in collecting the data and I think that's that's cool I think that um the this is this is just the citizen science research requires people to um to volunteer so they're volunteering their time but to also commit to some degree and when you have a people working as teams that helps with that committing I think yeah like the motivation and the accountability and all that good stuff yeah and um I have I'm in the process right now of processing my data from that was collected last year so I can't um I can't make a comment yet about the citizen scientist work last year however the first year that I did uh the pilot project with the citizen scientist program um what we found was really interesting is that they collect all kinds of things not exactly not always exactly what I'm looking for but um what they did collect um was a species that I had not found um in my in my data collection and um it was um I don't know it was a a species that um they didn't collect the actual exo-vier but they collected a molt uh a shed exoskeleton that was floating in the water and so it was a really mo-do-do-us visit modo.us for the best

The kind of a cool it was a different piece of it was a really unique piece of information oh i love that how like it's isn't it fun i mean that's sort of the the whole point right when it comes to these scientific questions that we're asking and sometimes we can get really in in the weeds and really focus on very specific questions looking for very specific outcomes and then every so often there's like a really nice surprise that you come across that kind of changes your perspective of it yeah i mean all the i mean all kinds of other things that i am not surveying but yet i'm still interested in things that live in the pond and spiders and and other aquatic insects that what they collected were i say valuable pieces of information um just not they're not data exactly for my research but doesn't matter um pretty interesting still important right it all kind of comes together to tell this this big important picture i think it's really smart and it's really cool um that so many scientists are discovering and realizing that whether it be the data collection side of things as it often is the case with citizen science in um wildlife or whether it be the data analysis side of things like is so often with things like um galaxy zoo and some of them were like astronomy physics citizen science opportunities that are out there um regardless that there's just a lot of information that needs to be made sense of it needs to be collected and then we need to make sense of it and if you can enlist people who really care about it and who want to help and maybe it makes their experience of visiting a cemetery for example that much more fulfilling what a cool way to collaborate with with individuals like living within your own community so one of the things that i've heard mentioned a lot is that within the biological sciences anyway the question of how useful is citizen scientist data mm-hmm and um you know this is still i think we're still early on in i'm not saying we just us at monomer but people in general this whole how how to include more people and how to um be able to use what they can collect to treat them well to um teach them i i don't know i think it's i think there are a lot of benefits in addition to what benefit you get from actually producing data oh yeah for sure it's probably really fulfilling both for the individuals involved but also for the scientists who get that data and i think probably i mean my assumption is in paul i'd be interested to hear what you have to say about this my assumption is that there are downstream benefits that we can't really even calculate yet because of things like i naturalist and because of these large databases that maybe somebody who makes an identification as they're hiking on their neighborhood trail says oh i think i saw this snake i'm not sure what it is here let me snap a picture and now it's got your GPS coordinates and it's timestamped and you know maybe a couple scientists who are on there a couple of local naturalists who are on there like oh yeah that's a whatever rattlesnake oh okay cool but then later down the line it may become really relevant that all of those all of those sightings were collected because somebody working on their doctoral dissertation five years from now might say i want to look at all of these different timestamped collections and i have a really important research question that i'm trying to answer and look at this wealth of information that's in front of me absolutely and you know one of the um beneficial components of all this work being done here is uh botarban cemetery is located right down the street from Harvard University and so at the museum of comparative zoology we often will donate specimens for their collections there and that has proven to be very important and very useful to various faculty members over at Harvard who then you know um can come over to Mount Auburn and do additional research uh based on you know some of the discoveries that have occurred here um and i think one of the really great benefits for our citizen scientists are as they attend classroom and field trainings and as they participate in tutorial walks their knowledge as they participate year in and year out uh grows and they become much more familiar and much more competent in the subject matter and then it's really gratifying to see these people not only communicating uh you know with each other to share information or reaching out to researchers who may not even be working who they may may may not be working for uh to share information based on their observations but they also um you know become comfortable to share with visitors who come in and might see them in their citizen science t-shirts or notice they're they're wearing a land yard um you know that that says they're a citizen science volunteer and so they describe not only our program but they describe the work that that is being done and and people are just you know amazed to learn about it but i you know i think just based on you know what i noticed from observing our citizens scientists is that it's very gratifying to them to be able to share what they've learned yeah we're essentially building a science community here and then where are they going to take that i mean ideally hopefully that they will themselves and also people they communicate with will be interested in looking at well what's in the park that's down the street from where i live like i know now i know what to to look for in certain some certain wildlife component now i can let me go see if it's down there now for my in my um urban ecology research and a lot of other um researchers as well um a lot of times uh urban habitats are ignored and assumed to be like nothing yeah or like just hated or something yeah like yeah that's weird and so for for a long time now um biology um and ecology um have ignored urban habitat and what they're finding now i would say around two thousand was one thing's really started to to get um going and i mean in all over the world but also all different kinds of wildlife um have have um people are looking more at urban populations find finding stuff that they didn't know was there and and then finding stuff novel situations that have um come about because this is a non natural type of environment and certain animals and plants are adapting to these weird conditions and so we have a weird mix that's not the same as in natural pristine habitat yeah you know i was i was interested to to find out you know Maria for example you you mentioned um some of the kind of unexpected outcomes of finding this molt of this organism that you didn't expect or um maybe some of the insights about the uh salamander was at the spotted salamander and how they've thrived over many of the years maybe between you and and Paul especially because they're you know like you set upwards of nine projects going on last year um i'm wondering if there's anything that sticks out to you in your mind of like interesting findings um whether you expected them or not but things that you're like oh this is the fruit of our labor like look at this cool stuff that we've been discovering through the use of citizen scientists and also just through really being able to take the time to um observe in these in these um interesting environments uh well i would say that one of the really interesting things that i've seen is that um when we were doing the made event phibian reintroduction it's time to play big on moto social casino america's

at our varnal pool area which is in the center of the cemetery and it's essentially um you know uh heavily wooded uh glenn in the center of the cemetery and it was interesting to see as uh the tadpole's metamorphosis and then eventually went up onto land it was interesting to see where they dispersed to and uh where future breeding populations occurred uh because what happened was american toad uh completely bypassed upon in between the varnal pool and another pond and they began breeding in that third pond and um and you know and it was interesting because we could see toad blets out on the ground so all over the cemetery but they weren't they for whatever reason they had skipped that that second water body um so um and several years went by and then finally we started hearing uh the trilling uh in the spring from the american toads at that at that third pond and uh so it was uh you know everyone was very excited and made sure to uh go over to that pond uh to to you know observe the toad blets once they emerged from that water body and it was you know really uh uh something special to see uh how uh wildlife uh you know uh disperses and then uh its populations grow uh uh you know because it happens in unanticipated ways and and anecdotally there's data that those toads have left the premises and gone elsewhere um it's anecdotal at this time but that the population has moved to other places where it was not where it had been extirpated yeah very cool far yeah right we there um there's an old railway line that runs along uh the perimeter of my armor cemetery and then it heads over to a reservoir in Cambridge um and that has kind of acted as a wildlife corner uh and so uh some amphibians but also mammals as well uh have made use of that old abandoned railway line which is now being turned into a multiuse bike path uh so it'll be interesting to see how that impacts uh the the traveling uh of some of our wildlife uh but uh yeah it's uh you know those amphibians were released here uh and they've they made use of that corridor to to bring themselves to new breeding ground and i say that um hands down all of this amphibian stuff is like is very cool like that that's the top thing i think for what's been going on here um but with regard to my dragonfly data um i'll i'll tell you um well they're compared to my research in Rhode Island uh looking at urban ponds as well um the the ponds that i've been studying here have been pretty low in diversity of dragonflies however um what is very cool is that the two ponds that i have surveyed now for four years um uh on monoburn's property have entirely different um species uh communities emerging from them so cool so they kind of like distinct uh little environments yes one being the vernil pool and the other being the largest pond on the property it's very sunny and open has a lot of uh uh a lot of surrounding area is lawn um and whereas the vernil pool like like um paul says it's it's in a glen so it's like it's it's got a lot of towering trees and woods around it and it and it sits in a like a like on a hill um anyway but um but so yeah so very cool that the fact that they're a very different populations and then this year so the the first three years of data that i have have been like i said very species poor compared to places in Rhode Island um but um but consistent until this year and then this year i had a bunch more a new species that showed up so i guess that i'm processing that right now uh but um i know for sure that there are at least four new species of dragonfly that i had not detected before wow that's exciting and surprising i mean it's so cool that in each of these individual research projects there are these exciting outcomes and just you know it kind of iteratively increased knowledge but also sometimes these these little shifts and knowledge that can occur kind of quickly when you discover something new and those are specific to the individual projects that you're doing i'm wondering as we're getting kind of close to to closing up our conversation if maybe both of you have anything to share about um how you know how these projects at Mount Auburn can potentially have a larger impact like what can other researchers um other people who are interested in citizen science maybe learn from the work that you're doing how might it be applied in other areas and you know what's sort of the greater impact of of this kind of investigation well i i think um probably the most important takeaway uh from any citizen science program going today is that uh these programs should be designed not just for the you know to help a biodiversity researcher with their research but also to get people outside closer to nature because people more than ever are demanding to know what is happening what will what exists around them and what is either happening to them or what they fear may happen to wildlife or uh you know the the the flora all around us as you know we hear these you know terrible stories of you know wildfire wildfires and droughts and flooding and sea level rise yeah colony collapse and yeah all these things that are happening with um globalization with climate change with habitat loss like these terrible outcomes right so people really want to become part of a solution uh and they want to get involved and i i think that um you know citizen science is a great avenue for people to be able to participate um and i i also just wanted to really briefly mention that um Mount Auburn also participates in the annual city nature challenge that i believe uh lost angeles and san francisco oh yeah some years back so Mount Auburn is a uh is a site uh every uh every year for a bioblitz of the city nature challenge so we're we're proud of that oh that's very cool yeah i'm like i'm always involved in that every year i have a lot of good friends at the natural history museum of la county who spearheaded that and um yeah there's like a fierce rivalry with san francisco here in la about who can make more uh uh observations in that city nature challenge that's really cool to hear that you guys are heavily involved in that as well i think it's so fun and it's just it really is so important i hope ultimately that that um the i'll reach um continues to expand and if that can um eventually in um influence politics and land use um decisions whether um locally or regionally or nationally i hope that's one thing i hope for and the additional thing that i wanted to add is that um i would like to have more homeschoolers involved in this oh so well yeah hoping to connect a few people i know this year but i um yeah so um that that would be something cool to add another real um a different uh demographic to the citizen scientist program and that i ideally would also influence people in the future as they um learn and get older and just you know decide what they want to work on in the future absolutely and i think that kind of both of those points really in a way are a great um a great segue into the final two questions that i that i like to pose to my guests on the show because i do think that they tend to um they tend to evoke or elicit more of a thoughtful and and maybe you know dare i say political um response and so i think that that bringing those those topics up are really important so so you know if you guys are ready for these are kind of big deep questions and i would love to get both of your perspectives and feel free to kind of go one after the other or to play off of what each other says um but i want you to think about the future um which obviously both of you do in your work on a regular basis so so thinking about the future in whatever context is relevant to you right now so this could be like global climate change this could be um the future of citizen science the future of your work or or or even much larger um uh kind of perspectives the first thing i want to know is what is the thing that absolutely keeps you up at night the thing that you're most concerned about oh that you know maybe you're even a bit pessimistic about like things aren't looking very good we got to we got to get on this and and on the flip side of that what is the thing that you are really genuinely hopeful and optimistic for um so yeah feel free if if one of you has an answer um that you just want to dive right in you can otherwise feel free to play off of each other with that well i would say that um under the current administration in washington i really have been taken aback although not unexpectedly but i've been taken aback by um you know the the the follow through to destroy protections of clean water and clean air and i worry about the generations that are going to follow us i worry about uh you know that folks with asthma and i worry about uh you know will there be enough clean water for drinking and agriculture and i worry about will will we be able to slow the earth from warming so that uh we can grow enough food to feed our own people yeah like what what is actually going to happen as these um even the minimal protections that have been in place are being systematically and kind of blatantly dismantled um right right in front of our eyes i yeah that's such an important concern maria is is that similar to where to where you're standing or do you have anything different or anything to add to that in terms of like what you're worried about i think this is similar um but i might state in a different way in that i um i'm most concerned with land use and habitat destruction and whether that be either eliminating things like forest or whatever or polluting um and not cleaning up or not being required to clean up or not being required to have a have a legitimate plan um so that's something that i'm concerned about um that does sort of mirror what um what Paul's saying um yeah um and so that yes sustainability is also um a factor there you know absolutely and and sort of on the flip side of that you know and it could be related or it could be completely different um what are you guys hopeful for you know where where do you see that kind of light um that silver lining well i um you know i think that um you know the the younger people that have come across that visit the cemetery when we talk about these subjects are almost completely unified on on these subjects uh you know their people aren't they're not going to their own corners and choosing what is truth uh based on their own desires at that time they are they you know they have accepted that there's a problem in that um the only solution is going to be through uh you know working together to solve it um and i i'm very much in agreement i teach college students and i have two students in elementary school two kids in elementary school and i am just like ready for the the the old older generations to move on in in regard to this i um i'm so glad that education is is really becoming uh very aware um specifically of um environmental issues and i hope that it's done correctly you know um but i'm really um i'm optimistic i i have to be optimistic right um i'm optimistic about about it i'm very glad to see that young generations have um a different perspective than say mine oh mine did yeah well Paul and Maria oh my gosh i learned so much chatting with you today i would love before we um before we say goodbye for you to let us know you know how can people learn more about the projects at Mount Auburn if they want to get involved how can they get involved how can they follow you guys's individual work um where should they go to to look all this stuff up well you can go to our website which is mount overn.org and um we we post uh information about our sustainability efforts uh on on various social media platforms including uh Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and uh we also promote our efforts locally i'll visit uh uh the local library surrounding us to post materials and uh and many of our researchers such as Maria also reach out to to folks on their own to kind of extend our sphere of influence about uh these subjects very cool um Maria anything to add to that hi um last year i started uh i presented my data at a um a regional conference here in New England um and it was uh it was really great because it was something different the i mean it was very something very unique um that was and i got a lot of great feedback and conversations that came out of that um i'm hoping to present my data elsewhere i'm willing to i've told a lot of different groups i would be willing to as a matter of them getting back to me i guess um and i'd also like to um i'd like to publish um more um and um yeah yeah yeah very cool so people um hopefully even the the broader community and the broader scientific community will have access to some of this information as well well gosh you guys it's been it's been so informative i want to thank you for taking the time out of your day to um to enlighten us about about the really incredible work that you're doing thanks carer was great to talk to you now thank you carer of course and everybody listening thank you for coming back week after week i'm really looking forward to the next time we all get together to talk nerdy it's time to play big a moto social casino America's hottest free to
