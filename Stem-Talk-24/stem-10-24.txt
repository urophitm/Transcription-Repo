 Welcome to Stem Talk. Stem Talk. Welcome to Stem Talk, where we introduce you to fascinating people who passionately inhabit the scientific and technical frontiers of our society. Hi, I'm your host Don Conegis and joining me to introduce today's podcast is Man Behind the Curtain, Dr. Ken Ford, IHMC's director and chairman of the Double Secret Sleshing Committee that selects all the guests to appear on Stem Talk. Hi Don, great to be here. So today, our guest is Dr. Joanne Manson, who is an endocrinologist, epidemiologist, and principal investigator of several impactful research studies, including the Landmark Women's Health Initiative. She is a highly cited researcher and was one of the physicians that was featured in the National Library of Medicine's exhibition, History of American Women Physicians. Her primary research interests include clinical prevention trials of nutritional and also lifestyle factors that are related to heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, and also the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogens as determinants of chronic disease. Before we get to our interview with Dr. Manson, we have some housekeeping to take care of.

I began listening to podcasts and really enjoyed Ben Bickman. I enjoyed your interview with Ben so very much. It was the best I've heard from him of all that are out there. I loved hearing about his growing up years and all the most important things I've been wanting to learn for him in one interview. I loved hearing the questions you asked, and I love how professional you are. So many podcasts are hard to listen to, but not with you. I looked over the other episodes, and I am excited to listen to them and get so much motivation for taking care of my health each day. Thank you. Well, thank you so much, AJ Farmer, and thanks to all of our other StemTalk listeners who helped StemTalk become such a great success. Okay, and now on to today's interview with Dr. Joanne Manson. StemTalk. StemTalk. StemTalk. StemTalk. Hi, welcome to StemTalk. I'm your host, Don Crenegus, and joining us today is Joanne Manson. Joanne, welcome to the podcast. Great to be here, Don. And also joining us is Ken Ford. Hello, Don, and hello, Joanne. Hi, Ken. So, Joanne, you said that when you went to medical school, your plans were ultimately to have your own clinical practice. So what drew you to end a technology? Yes, so I was really drawn to medicine because it was for me a perfect blend of my love of science, biology, with taking care of patients and service to society. It just seemed perfect. And my goal was really taking care of patients and hanging out a shingle in internal medicine and endocrinology. And what drew me to endocrinology was that I would be seeing patients with diabetes, which was a great interest of mine. I thought there would be a lot of opportunity for prevention, counseling, and working closely with patients in terms of modifying nutrition, physical activity. And also in general, endocrin is working with patients who have hormonal problems such as too high or too low a level of thyroid hormone or adrenal hormones. And these are conditions where you can really see great benefits from treatment. And the patient will feel better and be cured virtually even within weeks. So I very much like that aspect of it for some of the parts of endocrin. But of course diabetes is a chronic disease, whether type one or type two. So that also appealed to me working with patients where I also thought there would be a large role of prevention and working closely with patients on nutrition, physical activity, other lifestyle counseling. Your interest in the prevention of disease and disease states grew from things you witnessed early on in your medical career as I understand it. Can you share how that influenced you? When I was doing my fellowship in endocrinology after I trained in internal medicine, I was seeing many patients with diabetes and late stage complications such as kidney disease, eye disease, vision loss, the cardiovascular diseases. And I thought that this was really so unfortunate that there were so many patients with very late stages of complications from diabetes. When type two diabetes, the most common form or the 90% of diabetes cases is highly preventable with certain lifestyle interventions and nutrition and physical activity behavioral interventions. So I became more interested in working in the field of prevention research. What could be done? What information could be given to the public to try to prevent chronic diseases that are highly preventable and modifiable? And Joanne, your interest in women's health has some deeply personal influences. So we understand that your mother died from a variant cancer as you were just beginning your medical training. And obviously that had a major impact on you. Yes, I became very committed to working in the field of women's health and seeing that so many women's health issues were really understudied. Conditions that were predominantly or exclusively in women affecting women were understudied often really lagged behind in terms of both prevention and treatment. And so I became very committed to women's health research and that has been a focus of most of my research over the decades. And you said that your desire to go beyond the teachings of medical school, which is really more about learning about the pathology of chronic diseases, not about preventing them, that led you to acquire the tools that you felt you needed in epidemiology and clinical trials. So what specifically led to your interest in clinical research? I wanted to learn more about the methods and design of research studies than I had learned in medical school. I think that in general in medical school, you don't really learn how to do research. You can do some bench research and there's some opportunities to do rotations in research. But in terms of getting the tools of epidemiology, biostatistics, design of studies, implementation of clinical trials, it really was not a lot of teaching on that subject in medical school. So because I was so much interested in prevention of type 2 diabetes and also increasingly prevention of cardiovascular disease, I felt it would be helpful to go back to school for a while and gain some of those tools in study design methodology, biostatistics, and be able to do randomized clinical trials and observational studies related to these health conditions. Yeah, and just noting that public health research is very different than laboratory research. So Joanne, what was most valuable to you about your masters in PhD work in public health at Harvard? That's where you still work today just by the way. I think that the research was so valuable because it had such a clear relevance to humans. Often when you're doing research in the lab, you wonder, is this research in mice or rats isn't going to be relevant to humans? The research I was involved with was clearly relevant because it was in large studies of men and women and people and I was able to learn the methods for doing the observational studies, you're looking at what people are doing in terms of lifestyle behaviors and their health outcomes, as well as gaining the tools for doing randomized clinical trials to test different interventions in trying to prevent these chronic diseases. You and many others are interested as you've noted in prevention, but the health care system doesn't seem particularly focused on that. Is this a part of what led you to be involved in the nurses health study? Yes, absolutely. We really do have a disease care system in the US, not a health care system with a priority to prevent disease and maintain health. And I was very much interested in working with this large-scale cohort of women, the nurses health study I started out with the nurses health study one shortly after. There was a new study in even younger nurses looking at some of their risk factors and health outcomes in women and younger age groups, but the two studies together really have allowed me to look at many health outcomes, particularly type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and focus on nutrition and physical activity and many other factors. For those centers who aren't familiar with the nurses health study, could you give us an overview of this important study? The nurses health study one, the original study included more than 120,000 women nationwide and they were age 30 to 55 at the start of the study in 1976. So this study has been going on for really more than 50 or close to 50 years at this point. And the nurses two study began in 1989 and that was again with about 120,000 U.S. nurses. These are all registered nurses in these two studies and the women in nurses two were age 25 to 42. The original goals of the nurses one and two were to look in more detail at oral contraceptives and health outcomes. But the goals expanded tremendously after the early years to look at really all aspects of reproduction, reproductive factors, lifestyle, behaviors expanded very deeply into nutrition, physical activity and many different behavioral factors. The nurses health study is an observational study, but it held a nugget of something that would be pursued in the women's health study. That women taking hormone therapy had a lower risk of heart disease and reduction in all cause mortality. So you've said that the nurses health study did get the right answer, but it was to a different question. So what do you mean by that? Well, many of the findings in the nurses health study and other observational studies actually generated hypotheses to be tested in the women's health initiative randomized clinical trials. So for example, the nurses health study did see a lower risk of heart disease among the women who chose to take hormone therapy or whom their providers, their health care providers chose to prescribe hormone therapy for them. And of course, there can be certain selection factors. Maybe maybe the clinicians were choosing healthier women to prescribe hormones to maybe the women who were more health conscious and were more physically active, healthier diets. Maybe they were more likely to be interested in hormone therapy. It's very difficult to fully control for all those factors, which is why a randomized clinical trial where all those other factors will balance out very equally between the group given, the treatment such as hormone therapy versus the group given placebo is so important to do. But it turned out after we delved much more deeply into the findings from the women's health initiative that many of the nurses health study findings were born out, even in a randomized clinical trial, but not entirely. I really do not think we got the full answer from the nurses health study. There was still some confounding by healthier women using the hormone therapy in observational studies, confounding by socioeconomic status, education, many lifestyle behaviors. And even though you adjust for those factors, there's still some potential for confounding that can influence the result. But we did tend to see more favorable benefit risk ratios in the women's health initiative among the women who started hormone therapy in early menopause. And what the nurses health study was looking at was primarily women who started hormone therapy in early menopause, even if they continued it for hormone therapy for a decade or longer, they were still primarily starting early in menopause. So those findings among the younger women in early menopause aligned reasonably well between the WHOI, the nurses health study, and the WHOI women's health initiative. However, the results were very different between the nurses and women's health initiative in terms of the older women, women who were more than a decade passed the onset of menopause. That's really interesting. And we'll probably loop back to that a little bit. What do you think has been the impact of the nurses health study on public health and more specifically on women's health? I think the nurses health study has had a tremendous impact because this is such a large scale study. As I mentioned, 120,000 in nurses one and close to 120,000 in nurses two with very long duration, decades and decades of follow-up with the accrual of many incident cases of heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, other cancers, type 2 diabetes, many other chronic diseases. So we have learned so much not only from these two nurses health study cohorts, but also from so many other research studies, observational studies, epidemiologic studies throughout the world about women's health. But there still is a real role for randomized clinical trials where they're feasible when you can ethically give an intervention and look at a direct cause and effect relationship. And we did learn a lot from the randomized clinical trials that were done related to hormone therapy. And we'll talk also about calcium vitamin D and dietary factors. So, Joanne, you were in the research division at Brigham and Women's Hospital doing your training at the Harvard School of Public Health when you got the chance to become a principal investigator in the Women's Health Initiative. And that's a project that began back in 1993. So can you tell us how that came about? So the first woman director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Bernadine Healey, went to Congress and made a case that Women's Health was severely underfunded and that there were many pressing research questions related to Women's Health that needed to be addressed. And she asked for a large allocation of funding for Women's Health Research, which ultimately became the Women's Health Initiative. And this was in the early 1990s. And in 1992, 1993, the Women's Health Initiative was being designed and there was a call by the National Institutes of Health for applications to investigators and clinical centers to become involved in the WHOI and to help recruit for the study and follow up long term, the study participants. So we applied actually applied in 1992 and were selected as one of the original 16 fan guard centers for recruitment for the site. Ultimately, there were 40 clinical centers around the country recruiting participants for the WHOI. And I was a principal investigator for the Boston site of recruitment. There was only one site in Boston and that was at Brigham Women's Hospital. Can you give us a little bit of context for the Women's Health Initiative itself? How was this initiative designed and how were the women recruited to participate? And what were the specific questions that the Women's Health Initiative was meant to answer? So the WHOI was planned to be a representative cohort of women from around the country with diverse race ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background in order to do randomized clinical trials. The three randomized clinical trials were of hormone therapy, of a combined calcium plus vitamin D supplement and of a low fat dietary pattern, high in fruits, vegetables and grains. And to look at the role of those interventions in the prevention of various chronic diseases and the benefit risk ratio in this diverse study population with an age range of 50 to 79. It was meant to be representative of postmenopausal women in a fairly broad age range with a mean age, average age of 63. And it really was intended to address some of the most pressing questions that women had about maintaining health, good health during menopause. And there were many interventions and treatments that were being used, but without a lot of rigorous evidence, without randomized clinical trials. In fact, ironically, the only randomized trial that had been done of estrogen therapy was in men in order to see if it could favorably affect cholesterol levels and lower risk of heart disease in men, given that women tended to have lower rates of heart disease than men and could give an estrogen to men actually be helpful for their hearts. It's so ironic that the hormone therapy had never been tested at large scale randomized clinical trial in women to see if it prevented heart disease and to see the overall balance of benefits and risks. There was also a large observational component of the Women's Health Initiative. So of the 160,000 US women nationwide, again, age 50 to 79, who were enrolled in the WHO. About 60,000 were in closer to 68,000 were in the randomized clinical trials and a little over 90,000 were in the observational cohort where they were being followed up, you know, providing information on questionnaires about their health practices, providing bloods and urine, in some cases, urine's doing a number of biomarker studies and looking at the association with long-term health. So you've noted that the three interventions that were evaluated in the Women's Health Initiative were hormone therapy, calcium and vitamin D supplementation and aloe fat dietary pattern. So let's talk about hormone therapy first. So one of the first big questions that you tackled here was what formulation of hormone therapy should be tested. Can you talk a little bit more about that? This was actually done a difficult decision by the investigators and by the NIH. What formulation to use? However, at the time that the WHO was being designed in the early 1990s, by far the most common formulation of hormone therapy was conjugated estrogen with or without a progestogen. The most common progestogen was medroxy progesterone acetate and the progestin is added only to protect the uterus in women who have an intact uterus. Women who have hysterectomy do not need to take a progestin, they can take estrogen alone. So there were actually two separate hormone therapy trials in the WHO. Estrogen plus progestin in women with an intact uterus and estrogen alone among women with hysterectomy. And the main outcome of interest was heart disease. The reason the con-oral conjugated estrogen and the medroxy progesterone acetate were decided on as the formulation was because they were the most commonly used and also because this large body of research on hormone therapy and risks of heart disease, stroke, all cause mortality. Many other health outcomes was based on conjugated estrogen. Women using these hormones, the most common formulation versus women not taking hormone therapy. So there was concern that if a different formulation was used that hadn't been tested, very robustly tested in observational studies, a newer formulation such as transdermal through the skin, patch, or gel, estradiol, that if the findings were negative or not showing a reduction in heart disease or a favorable benefit risk ratio, it could be blamed on the fact that the formulation that had generated the hypotheses that had been used in so many of the observational studies had not been tested in the WHO. So the decision was made to go with the oral conjugated estrogen with and without the medroxy progesterone acetate. So can you give a listener some context into the finding that women taking the combination of conjugated estrogens and medroxy progesterone acetate or progestin had higher risks of breast cancer and stroke? Yes. So at the end of the WHO, in fact, the hormone therapy trials were stopped early. It was planned that they would go for about eight years. The estrogen plus progestin trial was stopped three years early because it was clear that the risks were outweighing the benefits. And this was particularly because there was no signal for heart protection, but there was evidence for an increased risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs, what we call pulmonary embolism, or venous thrombosis, an increased risk of stroke, and also an increased risk of breast cancer. This was with the combination estrogen plus progestin. On the positive side, there was a significant more than 30% reduction in hip fracture and osteoporotic fractures were benefited. And also there was a reduction in tight two diabetes and some other outcomes that emerged with later analyses. All cause mortality was actually completely neutral. There was no increase in all cause mortality in the hormone therapy arm compared to the placebo arm, but there were these various adverse outcomes that we later saw were driven primarily by the women who were at least 10 years past the onset of menopause. And less so by the women in early menopause, the women in early menopause, younger ages, tended to have lower rates of adverse events and somewhat more favorable benefit risk profile than the older women with hormone therapy. But we still conclude that hormone therapy should not be used for the express purpose of trying to prevent heart disease, stroke, dementia, other chronic conditions, but more should be reserved for treatment of hot flashes, night sweats, menopausal symptoms of that nature in early menopause. That was very interesting. And when you accounted for age, was the worst outcomes in the older women accounted for by their more advanced age or was it strictly an effect of the hormone treatment? So there were in terms of absolute risk, there were many more adverse events in the older women, women more distant from onset of menopause. And that was a function of higher baseline risks in those age groups. However, I think can you're asking this very interesting question about whether the hormone therapy actually had a different kind of effect in younger women than older women in terms of were the relative risk different. For example, were there increased risk of heart disease or stroke or various outcomes only in the older women? In general, with estrogen plus progestin, the relative risks were quite similar. In the younger women and the older women, they all showed these signals for increased risk of the blood clots in the legs and lungs and increased risk of a stroke and increased risk of breast cancer. However, with estrogen alone, there were some real qualitative differences in that the younger women did seem to have a clear signal for a lower risk of heart disease and heart attack with the estrogen alone without the addition of a progestin. And overall, you know, all caused mortality tended to be reduced in the younger women with the estrogen alone. But again, it was it was a borderline finding or not recommending women be using these hormones for the purpose of trying to prevent chronic disease or reduce all cause mortality risk. We're just saying there were signals that hormone therapy can be safely used in early menopause, women below starting in women below the age of 60 or within the first 10 years of onset of menopause. Hormone therapy appears to be safe for use for treatment of hot flashes, night sweats and these other symptoms. And the WHOI results really should not be used as a reason to deny hormone therapy to women in early menopause who have moderate to severe or bothersome hot flashes, night sweats, menopausal symptoms and are seeking relief from these symptoms and seeking improvement and quality of life. Many of these women are good candidates and continue to be appropriate candidates for hormone therapy, but it's a personalized decision making process. It really does have to be individualized, shared decision making between the clinician and the patient. I'm glad you clarified that I have heard that study used as a reason not to offer hormone therapy to women. And for the sake of clarity, the estrogen involved was at the oral conjugated estrogen, right? In the WHOI and both of the trials, it was the oral conjugated estrogen. Thanks. So following up on all of this, what has been learned as folks including yourself, follow with these women for the breast cancer risk over the subsequent 20 years or so? Well, the findings have actually been very surprising. There is a clear difference between estrogen combined with progestin and estrogen taken alone and risk of breast cancer with long-term follow-up. In fact, they're polar opposite effects. They're like mirror images of each other. So with estrogen plus progestin, after this is in the women who had intact uterus, no hysterectomy. These women began to see an increased risk of breast cancer emerging by about four to five years of treatment. And then that increased risk has persisted during the long-term follow-up. It's about a 40% or even even lower at some time points closer to 30% to 40% increased risk. But it has persisted in contrast estrogen alone, the oral conjugated estrogen alone without any progestin was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer that began to emerge within. It was already apparent as a signal during the intervention phase which lasted seven years, but by 10-11 years it became statistically significant. And with longer follow-up to 20 years, it has continued to be a substantial more than 30% reduction in risk of breast cancer and also a six statistically significant reduction in the risk of death from breast cancer. So completely opposite results with estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone. And what are the implications for clinical practice? Well first, when looking at benefit risk ratios and individualized counseling for hormone therapy, in a woman who has an intact uterus, has not had hysterectomy, she may really want to think about limiting the duration of hormone therapy to only five, seven years, not going much longer than that or at least factoring breast cancer into the benefit risk equation so that, you know, looking at her risk factor profile, she may still be a candidate for longer term treatment if she has high risk of osteoporosis and is an accandidate for other osteoporosis medications. And she really wants to take hormone therapy as a very low risk of breast cancer, no family, history, she may want to continue, but it has to be a shared decision making process with estrogen alone in contrast. Risk of breast cancer is not clearly within the benefit risk equation and the decision making process at least for the first 10 years of use. And we think that this may be particularly with the conjugated estrogen that they may have a tomoxifen like a fact, conjugated estrogen has in some studies had some of the properties of a what we call selective estrogen receptor modulator, does it exist in estrogen in some tissues and anti estrogen in other tissues such as what tomoxifen does, but we're increasingly seeing we recently published a meta analysis of all of the randomized trials that had looked at estrogen alone whether it was conjugated estrogen or estradiol and overall in the combined analysis, there continue to be a signal for a lower, lower risk of breast cancer. So when estrogen is used alone, it's possible it does not increase risk of breast cancer. This doesn't mean that estrogen should be used long term for no reason at all, no clear indication because at some point that may turn around to their being an increased risk of breast cancer, but we're not seeing clear evidence from randomized trials given the relatively limited duration of these randomized clinical trials. I think there are also some messages here in terms of whether you know certainly women who have a uterus, they need to take the progestin, so there it shouldn't estrogen alone should not be used in women who haven't intact uterus, but it may make a difference in terms of some of these decisions, some of the decision making processes. So because of the WHO's findings, there's much more common now to use transdermal estradiol rather than the pill form evaluated in the original trial. The way these two forms of hormone are synthesized in the body matters to the risk-benefit ratio, is that correct? Yes, absolutely. So the estradiol is that is given in the FDA approved estradiol medications, the patches, the gels, these are much more similar to the estrogen produced naturally in the body. Also, when it is given through the skin as opposed to a pill form which goes directly to the liver, you know, through the portal circulation to the liver and in the liver can increase the synthesis of clotting factors and certain proteins that may enhance the risk of clotting. There's more of a risk than a venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism when it's given as a pill. So when it can be taken as a patch or a gel or spray on the skin and it doesn't go directly to the liver and also lower doses can be used now. There's more variety and the options available to women in terms of doses and formulations. It would be expected that there would be a lower risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs and maybe even a lower risk of stroke which is often related to blood clots forming. But the caveat is that we don't yet have the large scale randomized clinical trials to prove or to really confirm that the transdermal through the skin patched gel form of estradiol and let's say given with a bioidentical form of progesterone instead of MPA using micronized progesterone. We don't yet have the large scale clinical trials showing that that has a more favorable benefit risk ratio than the formulations tested in the WHOI. But there's a great deal of evidence from observational studies and from looking at biomarkers and like clotting factor levels that the estrogen given through the skin patched gel spray that that will be less likely to increase clotting risk than estrogen given as a pill going directly to the liver. Really good answer. Thank you for that. Stem Talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, a not-for-profit research organization investigating a broad range of topics aimed at understanding and extending human cognition, locomotion, health span, resilience, and performance. So, Joanne, you mentioned that the use now of estradiol, which is more like the estrogen that women naturally produce, may avoid some of the risks in the older forms originally tested in the WHOI. Would it be protective in terms of cognitive decline? It actually may be protective. There's a very strong hypothesis that if estradiol, the more natural form of estrogen is given very early in menopause, that it may slow cognitive decline, memory loss, and some of those adverse cognitive outcomes. However, we don't yet have clear evidence from randomized clinical trials that estradiol or conjugated estrogen started early in menopause will lead to protection against cognitive decline. What we do have is several randomized trials showing neutral effects, no increased risk of cognitive decline with either estradiol or conjugated estrogen when started in early menopause, such as women 50 to 55 or in the keeps trial women within three years of the onset of menopause. Those randomized trials suggest neutral effects, no adverse or deleterious effects, as we're seeing with the older women in the WHOI memory study, the women age 65 and older did have a higher risk of dementia with the hormone therapy, the combination of conjugated estrogen and MPA was associated with a higher risk of dementia in the older women above age 65 in WHOI. In the younger women, it seems to be neutral. However, there's a great interest right now in looking at whether you can particularly get neurocognitive protection if you start early in menopause and the women have a moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, some of those symptoms that have been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline, especially if you can improve sleep, it would be expected that you might see some benefits of the estrogen given in early menopause and this is when the symptoms are most likely to be severe or bothersome in early menopause, as opposed to later menopause, one of the reasons why it could be mutually beneficial in that, you know, it would not only treat the symptoms and improve quality of life at times when the women are most affected by hot flashes, night sweats, but may also be more likely to have favorable effects on the benefit risk ratio for chronic diseases, including cognitive decline, but it really does remain to be proven in large-scale randomized clinical trials. So we have a very strong interest in that question and other investigators are interested in that and I think there will be additional research on this question, especially when women have symptoms, disrupted sleep, hot flashes, night sweats, do they get a benefit in terms of cognitive function when hormone therapy is started early and relieves many of those symptoms and improves sleep. One would anticipate that they would just if sleep was improved, but I'm glad you're going to look into that and see if that's true. It does seem logical. I agree with you Ken that would seem very likely that there should be that benefit, but so often research has been surprising with even paradoxical findings that were never expected. I think once there is the clear evidence in randomized clinical trials, it will make a big difference also in our understanding of the role of hormone therapy in the early menopause. I think so too. Something I think we share a little bit of pet peeve on is the way the term bioadionical hormones is used. It's almost become a marketing term rather than a clinical understanding. One can appreciate what the intent was, but it really is being used very aggressively in marketing. Do you have thoughts on that? Yes, I agree. It is primarily a marketing term and I want to make a big distinction here. This more natural quote unquote form of estrogen called estradiol, also called a bioidentical form of estrogen, but it is available to women through FDA-approved treatments. Treatments that have gone through very extensive testing for quality control testing. You can get from prescribed by your regular doctor and at regular retail pharmacies. The really big concern is when you go to a compounding pharmacy and you don't get the FDA-approved treatments, but you want to get quote unquote bioidentical estrogen through a compounding pharmacy. You have much less assurance about quality control and often the dose that you get will be variable will not have the same standardization of the content of the product. There can be impurities and contaminations introduced that has been shown in a number of studies and audits of the compounded treatments. I think it is best to use the FDA-approved products. They now come in many different doses, many different routes of administration and formulations. There are so many options for women with FDA-approved regulated products. It's better than going the compounded pharmacy route for getting what you think is something magical and much more like the natural estrogen that women make. It is no more like natural estrogen than what you can get with estradiol through a retail pharmacy and FDA-approved product. Yes, I know many women using estradiol and in most cases you would have to wrestle it away from them. The reaction is usually very positive, at least among the ladies I know. But again, women can get estradiol. Estridial is available in FDA-approved formulations, many different doses. It just needs to be the products that have already gone through the testing that are regulated by the FDA as opposed to getting the compounded products. I wasn't proposing compounding pharmacies. I was just seeing the popularity is significant, at least among my cohort of people that I'm friends with. Totally agree with you. So can you talk a little bit about the role that Pyramid and Puzzle Earth control decisions can play in the management of hot flashes for women in their 40s and 50s? So, menopausal hormone therapy itself has usually been reserved for women who have already had their final menstrual period and have gone through menopause, whereas women in perimenopause or the menopause transition, which includes several years prior to the final menstrual period. This is a value to women who have very irregular periods, heavy bleeding, and also if they have hot flashes, night sweats, and they're getting these great fluctuations in their blood levels of estrogen, they can really benefit from a treatment that they're usually not given the post-manopausal hormone therapy. They're more often given a low dose of oral contraceptives or as birth control pills. And not only will those low dose birth control pills help to reduce their symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats will provide some symptom relief, but they also provide birth control. They will prevent unintended pregnancies. There is intermittent ovulation that occurs in women who have not yet gone through menopause, you know, they have not only fluctuating hormone levels, but also fluctuating ovulation, meaning that they actually could become pregnant. And it's the birth control pills and the birth control treatments that will prevent the unintended pregnancies and provide, you know, contraception, but actually the menopausal hormone therapy that's the lower levels of the hormones and would not necessarily prevent pregnancy. So I think it is an important distinction that women who are in their 40s, it's sometimes even into their very early 50s, but if not yet had their final menstrual period, are not yet menopausal. If they're having distressing symptoms, hot flashes, night sweats, up other some symptoms, they at a very irregular period, they may still be candidates for low dose oral contraceptives, which can be of a great help to them and they can discuss that with their health care provider. Let's now talk about the second pillar of the Women's Health Initiative, the Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation trial, which test whether this supplementation lowered the risk of hip fractures and postmenopausal women. So what did you find here? So the findings were actually complex, but overall there was no significant reduction in the risk of hip fractures, which was the primary endpoint of the Calcium plus Vitamin D trial. We tested in WHOA, a low dose of Vitamin D, was only 400 I use a day and a thousand milligrams of calcium. What was interesting is that in the women who were 60 and older were the fractures were more likely to be osteoporotic fractures. There actually was a significant close to 20 percent reduction of hip fractures in the women who were not taking any of their own personal supplements of calcium or Vitamin D. Again, we saw a reduction close to a 30 percent reduction in hip fracture with the calcium Vitamin D intervention compared to placebo, but because the primary endpoint in the overall study population was not significantly reduced, hip fracture was not significantly reduced in the overall study population. The conclusion was that calcium and Vitamin D supplementation should not be routinely prescribed or recommended for women in menopause, you know, women age 50 to 79 and older ages really has been tested, but the point being that it shouldn't be a routine universal recommendation. But based on the WHOI plus other evidence, it is very appropriate to use calcium and Vitamin D supplementation to fill gaps in nutrition intake, such as women who have a low dietary intake of calcium or Vitamin D. Let's say they have lactose intolerance and they very rarely have dairy products which not only have the calcium, but also are often fortified with Vitamin D. They may be candidates to get up to the recommended amount of calcium, which is 1200 milligrams a day of calcium for postmenopausal women and 600 to 800 I use a day of Vitamin D for women in those postmenopausal age groups. So basically, the recommendation is to use the supplements only to fill the gaps, not in the higher dose that was, you know, like a not necessarily a thousand milligrams of calcium, but maybe it's only 500 milligrams of calcium needed to fill a gap between the amount through the diet and the total amount recommended for these age groups. But overall, we recommend trying to get adequate calcium and Vitamin D from food sources and many foods are fortified. Look at nutrition labels, but don't be afraid to take a supplement to fill in nutrition gaps. What was new about WHOI was it was testing calcium and Vitamin D in postmenopausal women at typical risk of fracture, not like the earlier trials which had focus on women who already had a diagnosis of osteoporosis or prior fracture, osteoporotic fracture, or were known to have low bone mineral density. It was actually focusing on usual risk women in these postmenopausal age groups and concluded that using calcium and Vitamin D supplementation should not be a routine recommendation. So we've covered the first two pillars of the WHOI. The third pillar, the dietary modification trial looked at whether a low fat dietary pattern reduced the risk of breast cancer or colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease. What did you find here? Well, it's really interesting, Dawn. We looked at a dietary pattern that in many observational studies had been linked to a lower risk of breast and colorectal cancer. And we wanted to see if modifying diet, especially reducing total fat. There wasn't a particular focus on the type of fat unsaturated versus saturated. It was just reducing total fat and increasing fruit, vegetables, and grains could then reduce the risk of breast cancer. And heart disease was a secondary endpoint. Interestingly, we saw a borderline reduction in both the incidence and mortality from breast cancer during the 8.5 year intervention or treatment phase, but it wasn't until longer term follow up at 20 years that we saw statistically significant reduction in breast cancer death. And this began to emerge only with continuing to follow the women and look at the data, national following with national death index and many other sources of information about breast cancer death. And we did, we did see it emerging at later follow up. And for heart disease, we did not see a reduction with this type of diet, but the focus here was on total fat as opposed to type of fat. For heart disease, it seems more important to focus on reducing certain types of fats such as saturated trans fat and even allowing or encouraging more of poly and mono unsaturated forms of fat such as from fish and olive oil and types of fat that nature, which have been linked in many studies, both observational and randomized trials with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Fantastic answer. So what questions are left for the WHO to explore? So many questions. I mean, really, I would say it's a treasure trove of opportunities for research. Maybe many of your listeners are interested in doing research or possibly collaborating. So many opportunities out there. Now, one focus we have is healthy aging. Why do some people become centenarians and maintain, because we have many WHO participants who are now in more than 100 years old, getting to be 105 years old, some of them. And we really want to understand what is leading to some people being able to have longer health span, not just life span, but health span, living longer without the development of major chronic diseases, which is what we call health span. And many people who do live past 100 have longer health span as well, because if they're developing, unfortunately, developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, dementia, even type 2 diabetes, and we're ready for diabetes, then very often the life span is also shorter. But particularly this question of staying healthy through a longer period of time. And we're delving deeply into this using a lot of biomarkers for healthy aging, including the DNA methylation, epigenetic markers, using metabolomics, looking at small molecules and proteomics, looking at the various proteins in the blood and the patterns. We are really interested in trying to understand not only the role of lifestyle factors, nutrition, physical activity, but also the role of social determinants of health. How do neighborhood community factors influence the aging process? What are the stressors that people experience, including psychological, psychosocial stressors that can adversely affect health individual factors as well as community-based factors? So we're really trying to delve deeply into what is related to more favorable, healthy aging and what can be done to mitigate or counteract some of the stresses that so many of us feel, regardless of, you know, that's really very hard to avoid some of the, you know, psychosocial factors, social isolation, for example, depression, you know, what can be done to try to minimize the risk from some of these adverse stressors related to individual factors as well as community-based factors. So that's a strong interest of ours right now. That's great. And at IHMC, we share a strong interest in health span. In fact, we just opened a large new research complex titled Health Span Resilience and Performance, and it's really focused on the kinds of issues and methods that you mentioned. So I'm so happy that you're heading in that direction, particularly with WHOI and all the possibilities there. It's in gold mine of potential research. And also as you're suggesting, you know, looking at what can be done to maintain good cognition and avoid dementia is just so important and there's so much more research that needs to be done on that question. And you know, recent study in British medical journal actually suggested that much of dementia itself is preventable, that there are 14 factors that have that are modifiable and linked to a prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. And this plays such an important role in health span and quality of life. There are so many research questions that we haven't yet even begun to tackle. And we're very excited about the future science as well. That's really good. Earlier we talked a little bit, quite a bit I guess, about menopausal symptoms and the consequences of perhaps for a cognitive impairment. And there was a recent report, very recent in the journal Menopause. Could you tell us a little bit about that study and why those findings could be of note? Yes, I think that there's an increasing body of research linking these menopausal symptoms, the hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep disruption to adverse cognitive outcomes. And I think it is logical because we know sleep quality is tremendously important to cognition and to avoiding dementia. I mean, there's quite a bit of research on that question and menopausal symptoms can be very disruptive to sleep. And there are more and more studies now linking hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, not only to cardiovascular disease and there's some research out there for quite a while on that subject, but also now increasingly to cognitive decline. So what is considered cognitive impairment in these terms? Because I think intuitively it tracks that when your sleep is disrupted by hot flashes and your waking hours are disrupted as well, that your cognitive performance would suffer? Absolutely. I think in the short term it could be just related to being fatigued and tired, but when you're seeing really long-term effects and a downward trajectory in terms of function, cognitive function performance on memory tests and the different types of cognitive tests that are administered, then you need to be a little more concerned that it isn't just a transient. Oh, I didn't sleep well last night. I'm having trouble remembering things. I'm, you know, it's very tough today or maybe tougher two days. I think what we really have to worry about is the long-term chronic effects where it really can affect the trajectory of memory loss and cognition. Absolutely. So, multivitamins and memory are a topic of interest as well and it's hard to escape advertising for various supplements that claim to improve brain health and memory function. So, you and colleagues at Mass General Brigham recently completed research that shows the humble comprehensive multivitamins can delay age-related declines in memory and cognitive function by an average of two years. So, can you tell us a little bit more about that study? So, in a large randomized trial that we're doing called Cosmos, the COCO supplement multivitamin outcome study, we included multivitamins mostly to look at potential benefits on reducing cancer risk because multivitamins had shown some benefits for cancer in an earlier study, the Physicians Health Study 2. But surprisingly, we saw that participants who were randomized to receive multivitamins versus those randomized to receive placebo. I mean, these groups were identical virtually exactly the same in terms of all other factors in terms of education and lifestyle practices and health, their general health status. Those randomized multivitamins tended to do better on the memory tests and on the cognition tests and had less decline in memory and cognitive function over a three year period. These were three separate studies with placebo controlled studies within the larger Cosmos trial where we saw this. We did a meta-analysis of these three trials, these three substudies and saw that there was a really, really strong statistical significance to these differences between multivitamins, multivitamins group and the placebo group, like a p-value less than 0.001. And it was about the equivalent of slowing age-related memory loss and cognitive decline by about two years. So we're really interested in this question. Why to follow up not only on the multivitamins but also some cognitive benefits suggested by the Cocoa Flavinals. And we think that not to replace healthy diet but as a complement to healthy diet, some of these supplements may be a benefit, especially in older adults. We know optimal nutrition is so important to brain health and many older adults may have a deficiency in one or more micronutrients or may not have really good diet, high quality diet. And some of these supplements may be a complement, but we always emphasize that no dietary supplement will ever be a substitute for healthy diet or healthy lifestyle. So the priority, the focus really needs to be on diet and lifestyle, but we should pursue, you know, diet intervention studies looking at randomized trials at whether there are benefits of some of these dietary supplements, some of these other interventions in slowing age-related memory loss and cognitive decline. The problem is there are so many dietary supplements on the market, aisle after aisle after aisle 50 billion dollar industry in the US and almost all of those supplements are untested and not shown to have a clear benefit, right? And even concern about risk as they haven't been clearly tested for safety either. These supplements that we've tested for many years were very safe over the long term follow-up and showed some benefits that we want to follow up on. In 2018, your study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Vitamin D supplementation and Prevention of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease aimed to clarify whether vitamin D supplementation resulted in a lower incidence of invasive cancer or cardiovascular events. What did you find? We actually had some very complex results from the vitamin D and omega-3 trial or vital. What we found was that we tend to need only small to moderate amounts of vitamin D and most people in the US population through diet, fortified foods, we have a fortified food supply in the US and from sunshine ultraviolet be light from which we can synthesize vitamin D in the skin really are not benefiting from supplementation, not only in our trial but also many other randomized trials that have provided surprising results. But we did see a few signals for benefit from this additional vitamin D supplementation that we want to pursue including that vitamin D reduced advanced cancers cancers that were metastatic or fatal that there may be an effect of vitamin D on the tumor biology making tumor cells less invasive, less likely to be metastasizing. We also saw some effects of vitamin D. This was a dose of 2000 I use a day on reducing autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, some of these conditions which may be related to a role of vitamin D in tamping down inflammation and lowering some of the inflammatory biomarkers but we actually did not see a widespread benefit for every chronic disease we didn't see clear benefit for cardiovascular disease or many other outcomes but it was limited to a few outcomes and these are very exciting signals that we want to follow up on further. Yes I think it is exciting because it would be utterly shocking if one intervention affected everything so you've identified some strong candidates. Exactly exactly but you know surprisingly many people do expect that something like vitamin D or omega-3s which we also tested in vital will be a panacea and a cure-all for everything and you know there's a surprise that a certain outcomes were not affected but it is logical and expected that there would be more targeted benefits and that those maybe who have lower nutrient status would benefit or those with certain risk factors would benefit and that it would be more of a precision nutrition kind of approach rather than you know that would make sense rather than just every one size fits all approach expecting that a single dose is going to benefit everyone for every condition and that certainly wasn't the case in the vitamin D and omega-3 trial. In a way it's a good thing it wasn't the case because it would it would seem very unusual. Yeah thinking about this study and continuing to talk about it a subgroup analysis raised the possibility of differential effects on cancer incidents connected to BMI. I'm no fan of BMI but it is convenient so could you share a little bit about what was learned in terms of the subgroup analysis and BMI. Yes these were really intriguing findings in vital that those who had the category of healthy weight or normal weight body, misindexless and 25 did seem to have many more benefits from vitamin D supplementation than those with the higher categories of BMI and in fact even for our primary endpoint which was total cancer incidents we saw a significant 24% reduction among the group with normal weights BMI less than 25 but no reduction in the other groups and for breast cancer deaths we saw more than a 40% reduction in risk in that healthy weight group. So we also saw almost a 40% reduction in autoimmune diseases and many other outcomes were favorably affected in the group with the healthy weights and this may be because with obesity there's an a systemic inflammation going on there may be factors that interfere with the bio activity of vitamin D it's a fact on its receptor on the vitamin D receptor we are really drilling down deeply to try to understand these differences by BMI but it does not seem to be totally a dose related effect vitamin D is sequestered in the fat tissue so you might think oh with higher BMI you may just need twice the dose or higher dose but even the randomized trials testing very high doses of vitamin D such as 4,000 I use a day have found a similar difference between those who have a BMI that is lower versus those with higher BMI and the higher BMI group does not seem to benefit for example for prevention of type 2 diabetes they did not benefit in the diabetes prevention D2 trial looking at prevention of type 2 diabetes even with the 4,000 I use a day if they had a high BMI they didn't benefit with the lower BMI and there the couple it was 30 they did benefit so I think we need to understand this better and see if there's a way to address this modifying effect of body mess index so that everyone regardless of BMI or adiposity level can benefit from vitamin D supplementation for the roles that it does have we would want this to be available to everyone and maybe it requires using a metabolized form of vitamin D that can bypass whatever obstacles are occurring with let's say higher systemic inflammation or higher adiposity levels but we're trying to understand this better and hope over the coming years that will have many more insights into these findings yeah that's super interesting and I wonder if this data was looked at with respect to body composition instead of BMI whether the result would be the same or it might even be stronger and more explanatory it's a good it's a good question and we did look at it by body composition because in a thousand participants in the clinic sub cohort you know subgroup that has varied you know detailed examinations and analyses done we had the dexa body composition measurements and we saw even stronger associations when we looked at it by fat mass and visceral and you know really getting a sense of the body composition and the adiposity level so this does seem to be related to adiposity unfortunately we don't have dexa in all 25,000 participants in the studies we have to rely more on a BMI measure but we are really drilling down more deeply in the subset with body composition measurements I'm glad you are because it might help you really tease it apart you know that there are people like me that are borderline obese by BMI but aren't actually obese yeah yeah absolutely there can be a very big difference and in many people BMI is not a good indicator of adiposity so as we wrap up the interview we're curious what would you change about the way women's health is taught and studied when it comes to parimenopause menopause and postmenopause well it's seriously neglected and understudied in it's not even in many medical school curriculum and in training programs for interns residents and fellows so it really needs to be incorporated I think an increasing number of schools are doing that there have been some improvements at Harvard Medical School as well and it needs to be on the examinations also because often that's what drives you know what ends up being on the test is what really drives the curriculum they're closely interrelated so I think we need a lot more attention to this we need a lot more CME courses as well as train you know corporation of this training into the basic curriculum in medical school and the graduate training and then what is coming up next for you and your team in terms of research questions and the second question to that is what answers do you think we will have for gen X women millennials and gen Zers that we don't yet have it's a great question I think we will hopefully have many more answers for coming generations of women first I think we do need a large scale randomized trial of estradiol transdermal estradiol micronized progesterone the formulations of hormone therapy more commonly being used now I think we need to understand the benefit risk ratio so that's information that I hope we will have before long for women of future generations also what I was mentioning before about healthy aging and the role of social determinants of health individual and community based factors stress anxiety depression we need so much more research on these topics I think this will be highly relevant to younger generations to you know have more research in these areas and really be able to guide some of the interventions and behaviors even something like understanding better the role of social media the role of the community it can play such a positive role but then again in some circumstances it can really increase the stress that people are feeling and I think with really good rigorous research in these areas on you know healthy aging and again the social determinants of health community and individual factors will really be able to move the needle quite a bit for future generations I certainly hope so Joanne we know you have a plane to catch and we are grateful for the time you've been able to give us before we close though I wonder given how busy you are what do you enjoy doing in your spare time if you have any spare time I don't have a lot of spare time but I do have to say that what I enjoy most is spending time with my family my husband my three children I am about to catch a plane to visit with two of the children in San Francisco and see my new grandson for the first time wow so I am about to get on a plane soon and I also really enjoy being physically active hiking being outdoors reading travel all all these things I enjoy but I will admit my schedule is very busy probably busier than I would recommend for most people if if I were giving them advice for good health but hopefully things will get better before long well I'd be wonderful and enjoy your trip to San Francisco and it'd be very exciting I'm sure to meet a new grandchild well thank you so much it was great talking with both of you Don and Ken
