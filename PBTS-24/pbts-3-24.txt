Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to People Behind the Science. Today, I am excited to be speaking with our guest scientist Dr. Yoni Thinkipness, so Yoni, welcome to the show today. How are you? Thank you very much. Today's what I'm having me and doing great. Well, thank you so much for joining us and before we get into the details of your work, I'd like to start by telling our listeners a little bit about you and how you got to where you are today. So listeners, Yoni is a BJC investigator and the Alan A. in Edith L. Wolf, distinguished professor of pathology and immunology. He is also a professor of neurology, neuroscience, and neurosurgery, and director of the Brain Immunology and Glia Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He received his bachelor's degree in biology from Tel Aviv University and his master's degree in neurobiology and PhD in neuroimmunology from the Wisement Institute of Science in Israel. Yoni worked at the University of Virginia for over a decade before joining the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis, and he has received numerous awards and honors, including an NIH NIA Merit Award, the NIH Director's Pioneer Award, the Harrison Foundation Distinguished Teaching Professorship and Neuroscience, a Gutenberg Research College Fellowship from the Johannes Gutenberg University of Minds, and the Distinguished Research Career Development Award from the University of Virginia. In addition, he is a member of the National Academy of Medicine. And Yoni, today we want to get to know you as a scientist, of course, but also as a person, so can you tell us what do you like to do when you're not doing science? I think when I'm not doing science in the lab or on computer, which actually usually when I do science is not really in the lab anymore, unfortunately, I do it on the computer or talking with studies in the lab to do science. Anyway, what you answer a question, I love to read a good book and I love to have a good class of wine and I love to cook and then to eat. So grilling is my passion. I would say the science. I like it and you mentioned reading as well. We love talking about books on the show. Do you have a favorite book that you'd like to recommend for all of us? Whether it's related to science or not? It's very hard to define a favorite book right because there are so many books that I like, but since we are on a science podcast and since we are talking about people behind science and talking to hopefully scientists or future scientists, budding scientists, and I happen to be at home in my desk. I always have next to me a book by Rita Leibbrandt-Cinney. She is a Nobel Laureate and neuroscience is Nobel Laureate who escaped from Nazis in Germany, came to the US, she came to St. Louis and was professor here at Washeau for many many years and she got her Nobel prize for discovering the New York Times of the birth factor in geore, which is very important molecule for neural growth and etc. So she wrote a wonderful book. It's called In Praise of Imperfection, My Lation Science. It's very well written, it's really beautiful and fortunate, it's this continuous. So you can answer you by a new book, you can go by a second hand, they're quite pricey, but libraries usually have it, we have one in our library in the lab. I have my private one at home, it's just incredible book, super inspiring and just the way it's written, it's so so well written, so highly recommend. Again, it's not too hard to answer the question of what's my favorite book, this is the book that I would definitely recommend to people and also because they see it in front of them. Amazing and believe it or not, you were actually the first person to recommend this book on our show, so I will have to add this to our list for our listeners to find their In Praise of Imperfection by Rita Levy Montalcini. Now we mentioned that you are oftentimes doing science particularly at the computer these days, but let's talk about your science. How do you describe your work to people who are outside of your field or perhaps outside of science altogether? So we are neuro-immunologists and basically we are working on the intersection of the immune system and the nervous system. Actually, it's a funny story. I was under graduate student at Rita University quite some time ago and I was working in the biochemistry lab and this professor tried to retain me in the lab for my graduate work, so he told me that biochemistry is the place to be. You will be in immunology or in neuroscience. Nobody knows anything what's going on there, it's such a new field, it's all just developing. Biochemistry is solid and I said, wait a second, I'm guessing, you know the gene neuroscience, okay, no taking, so I know where I want to be. And then when I joined the White Swan Institute in Israel for my graduate studies, I happened to listen to this professor, Mikhail Schwartz, and she was describing some crazy ideas about the direction of the urn cells and brain cells. And even though I really dreamt since I remember myself to cure cancer, I decided to give it a try and try her lab and I fell in love with the field and I never really left the topic of neuroimmunology. Then in 90s it was not a very popular topic field to be in, it was actually quite unpopular field to be in, but today it is blooming and everybody realizes and understands that the brain and the immune system are not forced, they interact constantly, brain controls immune system, activity immune system affects the brain function, they are mutually working together to ensure our organisms survival and well-being and I don't think anybody is asking anymore whether or not to systems interact, I think the question is now, how do they interact? So I think it's a exciting time to be in neuroimmunology, but again I was counting the form of those direct ties when neuroimmunology was not a fun topic to study. Certainly I think now absolutely you're right, the neuroimmunology is this budding, growing dynamic field to be in and I'd love to talk about motivation you spoke previously about this book that you keep by your side, by Rita Levimontal Tina, I think she's certainly an inspirational figure in science. Are there other people that you look up to yourself or people who perhaps helped you get to where you are today that you look to as role models or mentors? You know I have a bunch of role models, it's funny I call them God fathers and God models of science for me because I was never really trained with them but they've always been there and they were supporting me throughout the years and I don't know if I want to name them, I mean they know who they are, I don't want to name them so that you know maybe if I miss somebody people will get upset, but I'll tell you what I drive out of inspiration from people who are working in MATLAB as well. Some of these, I call them kids, they're not so kids, I mean they don't know the 20s and 30s, but some of these people are just absolutely incredible individuals, and they, personally they're brilliant, they're super creative, some of them are a mid-chimini of them come from middle-class working chimneys and I was just talking with one guy and he was telling me how he grew up in a late soccer without shoes because the family didn't have money to buy in shoes, you know that kind of level and then they reach all the way to top of the science he went to Hopkins for his PhD and then came to Wash You for his positive that he's doing with the collaborative hours and also working with us and it's just incredible you talk with these people and they tell their life stories and they come with these crazy ideas that are myself thinking about and then they implement them in the lab and they show that yes or not correct and then they are reshaping those ideas and we're discussing a lot and it just absolutely incredible so I do get all the inspiration from these people as well so I don't think it always needs to be somebody who is a super high-chirmer I think sometimes you just get inspired by people who are on their trajectory, you know even sometimes I'm the grader would talk with an undergraduate and I was like wow oh my god this is kind of like a heated soul so smart brilliant and so creative and just things in different dimensions and so these things are very inspiring. Well I love that you're looking for and finding inspiration in those around you and I think these people can be tremendous sources of motivation and for me at least it's helpful to have a little quote or a saying or something someone said to me in my mind as I go through a difficult time or even just to make it through the day sometimes so do you have a matcha or a quote or a saying that really keeps you motivated? I have a bunch it should so first of all I have worked for many years at University of Virginia and of course they are everybody's obsessed with Thomas Jefferson as was I absolutely obsessed with a man. Well we know it all founding fathers but I think Jefferson will head of course very special place in my heart for many reasons and so I to do the day I keep of course a bust of Jefferson on my desk not in the office you may think I'm crazy and also what's important for me he's book of quotes he's a Bible that is Jefferson Bible which is actually morals of Jewish Christ without the miracles which is quite incredible book to read the very very thin but very exciting but they also keep a book of quotes of Jefferson and some quotes there are extremely inspirational and once in a while I just go through and I'll just read a couple of pages from there but I do love quotes so I have on my door in the office I have a quote from the yes you guessed correct with a little chiny which says that without intuition there would be no science at all and I agree with 100 percent I think intuition is a very important driver and science and I know that a lot of things that I do and we do in the lab are driven by intuition my intuition intuition is the round me also I love there was a quote of Carl Sagan which said that something somewhere is waiting to be bound he said and I think I'm and we're gonna paraphrase it as discovered so somewhere something is there waiting to be discovered because I think that we all are growing in a world of dogmas even when you read a textbook it's all based on dogmas many of them are proven theories but they're still very very dogmatic in a statement and many of them are not really hundreds and proven so for example when I was growing up in science we grew up with this dogma that there is no lymphatic drainage from the brain so the sewage pipes taking waste products from every tissue into the lymphatic circulation to kind of detoxify the tissues the belief was that there is no such vessels around the brain and of course to attend years ago were like enough to find the specials and and to prove this dogma incorrect and I always quote the paper in a medical journal called Lancet from 2003 where they say that a lack of lymphatic circulation the brain was describing details in whatever year and I always ask myself how do you describe a lack of something in details and how many other things are out there described to not exist and they just laying down there and waiting for somebody to look under the rock and you find all new worlds so that's quite exciting absolutely I love that story and I think you touched a little bit on your background and kind of how you got into science I know your interests began in cancer research can you talk a little bit about what sparked your interest originally in this area of medicine or in science at all well you know it's funny because I grew up in a family of physicians so my father as a doctor as a one D and my maternal grandmother was a very strong much the art of figuring out family she's also in D and she was like our family doctor and she was a cardiologist but we would go to her with any key from my parents and their friends all the way to my children and their friends they would go go to she's still alive and well she'll be 100 years old next year it's coming south that's wonderful we no longer use her advice and medicine by anyway so the idea of me not being a doctor wasn't really an option so the family decided that I will be an MD of course but I remember myself as a little kid playing being a doctor but I always played as the one who discovers medicines and not only prescribed them so this was a very kind of ebid child with memory of mine and cancer you know I think even though I don't like those clichés statements but I guess cancer probably was because my grandfather died from cancer both then fathers died within same year three months apart and a very young age they were their mid fifties one died from our decanieries and the other one from cancer so one was very very fast and one was very very slow and very very painful for him and for the whole family so I guess he's sickness probably influenced my idea of cancer because neither my dad nor my grandmother were in an ecology field so if I have to guess I would guess that it was him who inspired me to think of cancer as a problem and to be waiting to fix it he passed away in early 80s and so big then we didn't even know whether cancer is infectious or is it not no and there was some kind of weird theories about it so I do remember that I remember that I was growing up and I was awarded that somebody will give cancer before I have a chance to see cool well there's still time right yeah so then when I went to Whitesman and I joined the very very strong lab that was working on cancer Mousheh Orren he should have gone one of the first major tumors suppressor genes P53 and I thought I would actually stay there but then like I said I heard this presentation about immune and brain and I just feel I'm loud so I never met a big cancer now we kind of look a little bit into brain tumors and I am really fascinated by the topic very interesting and then how did you make the decision to come over to the US to continue your training or take these faculty position at the University of Virginia so in Israel it's not even an option of not going abroad to Europe or to US of course US is preferred so I knew that I was going out for at least four or five years and I came and I loved it I love the brain demo of doing science I mean there's small things but then I think if you have listeners from outside of the US that everybody will understand you order a small reagent and if you like it comes in a week or two if you're unlucky it comes in three four weeks and here if you are I like it comes in two days and not only just go into the next building and you go into this what we call a mall mark for molecular mark a room and you just pick up your reagent of interest we ordered on a live end comes next day so the way of doing science in the US it's easy it's comfortable I've had a second lab in Germany for five years before covid it was very small lab it is well operation but you know that I was still a well of course ordering materials and the agents know this and I had trainees there and was uncomfortable to how we do things in the US I mean it was brilliant science brilliant colleagues wonderful trainees they think wonderfully but just the pace is very very different again because of the ability of reagents and machines and devices and what not so I'm a big pet jet of the United States and also a few science and I just hope that we will maintain that leadership in science in the US and that of course to maintain leadership in science in the inclusion of funds which we are benefiting from right now from NIH as a major source and I just hope that our leaders whoever they are in the future understand the importance of that support and that so it allows us to lead the science in the world I mean there is no argument about that today I think the leaders I don't say I don't want to say that best science is done in the US but I think that most of best science is done in the US we are absolutely those yeah I think having that support is critical and what then ultimately brought you you mentioned you were at University of Virginia for a number of years how did you end up here at Washington University in St. Louis I was a chair in Virginia chair of the department I had a wonderful department really exceptional colleagues and I loved your junior and I loved UVA and I loved Charlottesville but maybe two main reasons one is a little selfish I realized that I was in my meeting prime time in my forties and I probably have maybe an hour good 10 15 years to read it do some exceptional science and I wanted to maybe withdraw myself from administrative work and I think it's always good for X-share to move away somewhere and not to stay and bother the whoever next chair comes in basic departments of the New York department on medical campuses in the US because I think it's a little different elsewhere but maybe the main main reason why was she was because I think was she provides an absolutely unique opportunity to collaborate with clinicians as a joke I always say that every clinician at was she wants to be a scientist and every scientist wants to be a clinician and I think it's very true and also whatever crazy idea we have or whatever sample or whatever idea to discuss the tiniestions let me shut it down and tell me this is like they would be the weirdest the craziest thing they've heard it and they know a way to go but they will listen and we need to get the particular tissues and preserved in particular way I mean they're very very open to interact with us we hopefully not gonna vote maybe getting into pinnacle trial at some point soon and again we think that was sure will be a fantastic sight for that just because of how open they are and I think was sure is amazing when many aspects but I think that for neurovigeneration and for immunology this is really probably one of the very best programs in countries so for me coming in a place that has the very very strong immunology and extremely strong neurodeterative disorders can ask the technology and then combine the two areas and develop something new and exciting like the center that we have was really a very exciting opportunity and then I remember I was talking with some of the leaders here again without naming names or good friends also now I told them what if I regret what if I move and then now two three years I wrote I was saying oh we are really great coming in and he told me people more regret for things they haven't done and for the things they've done and I think it was another inspiring moment for me and yes on all regrets I think that some of the works that we've published since moving to Washeau we would have unfortunately not able to do it at University of Virginia many other places simply because of that interaction is very very close interaction with many people that makes sense and perhaps we can talk more about your work next is there a particular project that you are working on at the moment Yoni that you are the most excited about and want to share with us today so I have three kids they each one things that I like the other two more ummm same in the lab I have a bunch of projects and everyone thinks that I like the other projects more than I like their projects so I will not be telling you which project is my most exciting one but I will tell you that we just published recently paper maybe because of the recent most recent paper I can describe it came out today in print it was published a few weeks ago online in journal nature and this is gonna our first attempt to use cell that immunotherapy for neurodegenerative diseases of course we know about carthesols that are used for cancers and they are concept is a little bit simpler because we have t cells that can attack and kill cancer so we can take it those cells and treat them so that they will start organizing cancer cells even better and they will go and will attack the cells and kill them so when we have condition of neurodegeneration or in our case we just did it on CNS traumas panellacrid injury you don't want to kill beyond what already been killed so instead you want to go there and make the environment as fertile as possible so the damage doesn't continue to grow so remember CNS injury injuries in the brain as panellacrid are very unique because every time there is a damage of course what's being damaged will inevitably die but areas around damage which have not been damaged by the initial trauma will continue and also degenerate so that's a problem with stroke problem with injury it's a problem with every neurodegenerative condition so we have a spread of damage or what we call secondary generation and it's been shown by people that if you work on the environment you make environment more supportive for example you allow blood vessel to grow the other all this cleaning grow to commenting the area more efficiently than you can prevent the spread of damage so we had a goal in mind to take this immune cells and instead of making them kill something go there and organize the environment and make the environment more permissible neuronal survival and we were able to do it and we show this in mice that results were quite amazing basically we went into we believe that the immune response to any problem is at least initially it is aimed to be beneficial and protect because immune system is our main system of course things can go out of control and immune system may become detrimental in which case you want to show it down but the initial immune reaction is most probably beneficial in all conditions so with that in mind we took those immune cells out after very few hours days after injury we analyzed what these cells look like and we said what if we just now multiply those cells make a lot more of them and inject them to injured mice will that be able to help us and the long story the answer is yes or as we did some modification to them to make sure that they will not turn into the tremendous cells so that was working really well this in mice which were paralyzed they were now recovering walking not perfect walking but they were much much more improved and this is exciting also because again in collaboration with our clinical colleagues from the research department here at WSU we were able to get tuberous climate fluid samples from patients with spinal cord injury actually we get samples every day after injury for first week and even though we don't have of course data to show that yes these cells are beneficial for these patients but we do see that the phenotype over this cell does very similar to what we see in mice and then mice they are beneficial so hopefully one day soon maybe we'll be able to go with the cells to get taken from individual after injuries soon after injury expand them and then deliver them back in in a hope to ameliorate the damage we now testing the cells in other diseases and one that came into mind was ALS or Lebietic disease because it's also spinal and neurons are done what neurons are dying in spinal cord and we see some really exciting results there as well and this is just the first step in this immune therapy for CNS diseases so I think that this is a very promising in the referral ground which will probably take off and I know that there are already several companies who are looking into it and we're trying to launch a company as well so I really believe that this will be the future of neurological disorders again it will not probably cure Alzheimer's or ALS but if we can slow down this progression or even better if we can delay the onset of the disease I think that will be fantastic. Well Yoni I think this is really remarkable work and of course it has tremendous potential for impacts like you said in spinal cord injury and beyond starting to look at these other diseases as well and I know scientists doing important high impact research depend on their suppliers providing high quality research materials and products and we'd like to take a moment to thank our sponsor innovative research and to talk about their portfolio of human coagulation products from factor 12 to Fibrinogen innovative research provide scientists studying hemostasis and thrombosis with the products they need in the quantities they desire contact innovative research by email at sales at inov-research.com that sales at i-n-n-o-v-research.com to find out how their team of experts can provide human coagulation products for your research study today and returning to our interview with Yoni it's not always success in science as you probably well know Yoni and I think most of the time the public doesn't get to see the struggles the failures and all the things that lead up to these really exciting discoveries in science so can you share with us a time where you struggled with something or you perhaps had a major failure in science and could you perhaps explain what happened and walk us through how you got through it. So first of all most experiments fail and to be honest with you if experiments don't fail that makes me very very suspicious if somebody shows me a result so we judge exactly what we're expecting and it's like experiment of experiment I usually ask somebody in the lab to go and do the experiment together with that person it doesn't happen often but when it does I get to get even suspicious because most experiments in science are failing that's why we have to reproduce everything that's why we're doing it blind way so for example when we trick our animals we don't know which animal gets which treatment that is it's unavoidable because of some other genetic issues where you clearly see the disease any more versus not but when it's possible and it's often possible we try to do assessment as blind as possible when it's not possible we're doing we have asking two people to assess one who is in charge of the experiment and the other one who is just a lab mate just to make sure that it's as reproducible as you can again like I said because most experiments are failing with the failure you need to be also very careful because let's say you have a hypothesis and you are testing it and the results are negative is it negative because experiment did not work technically is it negative because your hypothesis is correct so it's always people that your negative result you also need to that so it's not like if it's negative it's absolutely right but if it's positive let's reproduce no if it's negative let's reproduce it as well just to make sure that we are always continuing on the right path and I always tell students when they come to me say oh my god my experiment failed you know I have people like bursting in tears in my office because experiments didn't work and because their hypothesis were all slain there without ever saying beautiful have us slain by early data I always tell them that if all experiments work then PhD would last for maybe six months and PhD goes for probably at least five years sometimes four and also it sticks or even seven but if everything worked then we would be done in four months I would write a paper submit and be done with it and probably I would say that most papers at the end that same first author can reproduce everything in probably less than six months but the time it takes to get to the experiments to working repeatedly I mean understanding precise conditions and all that requires a lot of patience and perseverance that's why I'm saying something which is not very popular is science is not for everybody because you're dealing with constant failures and remember we are also today for example in science the kids who come to science are usually brilliant kids most of them maybe all of them they never failed until the time they got into a lab and their experiments so very often we have these brilliant kids who just don't know how to deal with failure in life because nobody teaches them they all get in all through high school and through undergraduate with four O's and they believe that everything they touch is bound for success and it's not I mean is it all real struggles sometimes you would feel like I'm in my worldless clubs in my my I had a student who in his teeth the ear had to close his project funny enough we now understand that his project wasn't incorrect because there is another lab as the tool labs that eventually showed the results which were very similar to what he was showing so he wasn't wrong but at some point experiments stopped they're producing and nothing worked and he just came to me you know being diagnosed to play football in college and was crying in the office and I was crying with him because I felt the pain he was experiencing by the other hand what can you do right so things sometimes don't work and that's part of the world the part of the life and science of course you want to catch them early enough and if the project is not going then don't push it right that's why I'll stop people at the beginning of the project being initial experimenter laying the foundation if they are shaky if they are not hardcore or producible then drop the project you don't want to build your castle on the foundation which is all right and this is super important I myself experienced oh my god a bunch of figures as a bench scientist a student I mean yes I would always say that I need to have five projects or one of them at least succeed so I can publish something of course science like then 20 25 years ago was a little bit different because you could have had a one tiny small discovery you know you beatify it a little bit with some results around it and then you have media story and you publish your paper today to publish a substantial paper a lot more what needs to be done I think the criteria for acceptors in my opinion today or my district or them it was before it is need to provide a lot more evidence because we have a lot more scientific tools are much more advanced so we can provide these evidence that we maybe couldn't 20 years ago but requires a lot more work so the projects are much longer and then at some point when you realize everything I was doing is actually not what I was thinking results are the results right so if your result is not reproducible that's a big problem if you're taking your results that's on all different level and I really hope that we don't have many of these people in science and unfortunately we do but not so many but interpretation could change and I think it need to be open I think one of the worst problems is that people are married to their hypothesis they have theory and they merit to it and they try to make results a supported theory and I always say that results are unbendable but theories are and I can bend my theory to whatever results I have so I think once people realize that you'll get unburdened not to quote anybody but you do get unburdened by this idea that everything has to feed into that hypothesis unfortunately some principal investigators really want everything to work the way they thought about them and that's problem that's not how science should be done my favorite results are those that are showing significant difference between two groups which is opposite to what you expected initially when I see results just different what I've thought we just got this we just got the group and then I was like so happy I told my post that what an amazing result and all this and I said no it's amazing really a brilliant idea brilliant story he came to me for one and one and he says I don't understand why he's so happy about it I said what do you mean look at this difference they said yes but did you read the groups it's reverse and I said oh it is reverse but it's even more exciting enough because it's definitely real let's just make sure that it's reverse and that's fine let's think about it yeah exactly yeah yeah so you constantly deal with those failures and people who can't I mean it's a problem interestingly enough even though I had in my lab absolute brilliant people who are amazing scientists and one of them just now that he's only been in lab he was very young when he came to my lab usually I do see that there is some sort of advantage when people come a little bit older but a little bit more experience so if people are listening I would very much advise undergraduates don't rush into graduate school take a year or two or three do your post back research get some experience experience your failures it's better to fail on somebody's else project within your own project right learn how to deal with failures and then apply yes you are quote unquote wasting two three years I think you will gain those two three years and probably more during your PhD and then post doctorate of fine studies because you just come more prepared and also ask themselves very honestly do I enjoy it when I go to bed do I think about this project I mean is this really exciting because I think I honestly think that without being obsessed about the science and about the project you're doing I think it's very hard to continue in science because of what you ask because of all these failures so you really need to love it to deal with all the failures around you and again not everybody is in it and I see that people who are very successful in my lab and other labs these are people who constantly think and talk about science they're living their science and I think that helps tremendously to deal with failures you know if you're a problem in your family you keep going right that's your family so if you're a problem in your science and you truly love your science then you keep going you keep fixing the problem and trying to deal with them as they come well I think you brought up some really great points and I think just hearing you share your experiences helps normalize failure but we don't want to dwell on just the failures I'd love to talk about the successes as well so you only do you have a favorite success story in science whether it was bigger small there a bunch of success stories don't thankfully likely that we've experienced in the last 10 15 years or so well than a several in the might be the funniest one it was for my graduate work I think I just finished my graduate work and I still in a stand-up for post-doc and so I had this crazy idea that mice without functional immune system I thought would not be able to deal with stress which was short and then I thought okay what if in immune system supports bunch of other organs so it probably supports also the brain and if it supports the brain even mice without functional immune system the brain will be functioning as well so the learning and memory will be impaired I mean crazy idea absolutely insane but I was lucky to work in a lab with in house words where crazy ideas were more than welcome and I tried to mimic that and crazy ideas are more than welcome in my lab as well so which it would not do behavioral experiments in my house lab because we were more like a cellular molecular when neurovialogy lab so we sent our animals to a group of scientists and other institutions in Persia where University we sent our two groups of mice mice which were normal mice and mice without functional immune system and we didn't tell her what the experiment was about we just told her we have two groups of mice and we think that the one with maybe some issues about what we one group we did it because we wanted her to be as neutral as unbiased as possible as a shift called us and said I don't know one group of mice are real idiots and so we opened the codes and okay the group without functional T-cells till lymphocytes were the idiots so it was so exciting but that's not enough so then we took two groups of idiot mice so to speak two groups of mice without any inefficient sim and one of them we gave back in in cells which we thought were missing but two media disinfect the T-cells and we sent her two groups again I guess so now one group is a background of a stupid mouse and one group is a submit mouse plus the immune system which they didn't have which of course we're hoping to get an improvement and she calls me instead experimented into work and I said oh wow what happened she goes I still have one smart group and one stupid group and I said okay that's real it's working I remember the moment and then we send the paper to stop of the top node journals and they rejected it because they said that it's not enough novelty or whatever they said anyway that was really amazing feeling and the second one was in 2014 when a positive of mind discovered in phytic vessels and he called me to Metroscope and because he was doing a perfusion of a mouse and then was looking in the water of the brain by a whole mount and we saw some vessels which contained in the immune cells which didn't mix out because mouse was profused so all the blood cells should have been out of the blood vessels and we see these two vessels that are filled with immune cells and I mean it was weird so we said okay this could be lymphatic even though we know that they shouldn't be there because that's what the field states and that's what all the textbook state so when to colleague asked for markers to label for lymphatic vessels and just to kind of prove ourselves that we are wrong and so he put this markers and he calls me to Metroscope and says come see there are lymphatic vessels there and I do remember that moment that was incredible I remember myself now coming out of that room and saying okay this is really great this is something that I wouldn't dare to be dream to experience in my life so this was a very very fun moment so I think those moments where like you said the results are just so clear our few and far between in science but you have to take a moment to celebrate them yes exactly which we did oh good good and I think having these exciting projects and these exciting results is one of the great things about careers in science but the travel is another thing that really is a highlight in the career that many people may not realize is part of it so do you have a favorite place Yoni that your science has taken you yeah we travel a lot we travel a little bit too much every travel you learn so much right whether you're going to visit university and then you meet colleagues or graduate students and positives for lunch and then usually I come back with amazing ideas and miss new knowledge or you're going to conferences and if it's a good conference where unpublished data is presented then again you learn a lot it's like reading nonstop for five days but instead they're just telling you the stories about their work and you're hearing it from the first source it's incredible but lucky I've been to a bunch of places so I was born in the Republic of Georgia which was they've done a Soviet Republic of Georgia and in 1990 we left the country and moved to Israel and since 1990 I haven't been back to Georgia and then in 2017 there was meeting there and I was invited to speak and I guess that maybe that visit was very special just because in the seventies coming back to the country or you born it was very very special experience but I loved traveling to the east I mean China and Korea the culture is so welcoming and so exceptionally I love a lot with those countries it was missing it quite a lot during COVID but now thank God we're back I don't know I think I have like one place where I love to go actually next week I'm going to see some amazing lake appearance being in the Alps in Germany so look forward to it yeah there's lots of interesting places where scientific meetings take place you know and I think it is very important because some of these small meetings in really exciting locations you just get together with group of people who are like mine or not but they are interested in similar topics and he just continues to discuss and if people are open for exchange of ideas and maybe you're not getting agreeing this agreeing I think it generates a lot of new ideas creates lots of new projects in the lab so I think scientific travel is extremely important then if anybody thought that the zoom can replace it then they were delusional so today if I'm invited to give a talk by zoom I think that's remarkable you've been able to travel to quite a few places I love this story that you shared of being able to finally go back to your birth country in Georgia was it exciting to sort of see places that you perhaps remembered yeah I did sound you know in which travel so I also remember the places where we would go for our summer house and all this so I took a guide and we traveled and then in 2019 I came there with colleagues I was organized for a meeting in 2019 brought bunch of colleagues we traveled again I've been going since then almost every year and we just came back we were there in June again with the conference so trying to bring American science to Georgia unfortunately now it's still a developing maybe redeveloping country I think science wise unfortunately it's not as strong as it used to be but I think they are making efforts and it's really exciting to see this conferences going there and a bunch of people came from different countries from Europe from US from Asia and so we had actually very exciting three or four day meeting it was the immunology center then we had our new immunology session it was wonderful sounds wonderful I think the people in science are another thing that makes these trips a lot of fun being able to meet scientists from all over the world and just even in your own institution the diverse group of people that you get to work with over the years and I think so many cases these scientists that you work with do not meet the stereotypes that are out there in the media where it's always somebody in a stiff lab coat being very serious and working all the time I think some of the most funny creative amazing people that I know are scientists and I think these quirky traditions bring up in labs and you just share some funny memories together over the years so do you have an example Yoni of this human side of science whether it is a tradition or just a funny memory that you can share with us I think we will last week or two weeks ago we were at this huge conference for neuroscientists got society for neuroscience and after our social we went for dinner with a couple of colleagues I mean we were sitting there maybe for three hours we did not stop laughing my facial muscles weren't pain next day because we were just lashing like crazy and we were not drawing or anything we were just laughing because it was just good discussion but she two weeks before then it was in September it should not so long ago was the 25th 27th of September we had a conference here in St. Louis and we called it a recent neuro immunology and it was our third year so we were in St. Louis in 2022 we went to white spirit in 23 and then we came back to St. Louis in 24 and we're going next year to Boston and hopefully France and we'll see where we're going next it's a tight group I mean we bring new stickers all the time but it's a tight group of core investigators and St. Louis we have this very quirky school the city museum just google it up it's really funny it's like a playground for adults so all the serious scientists after a whole day of discussions enough their dinners so we'll eat and in a really fancy place we're all coming there nobody knows what to expect and I tell them all you know as your absurdions come coming in for half an hour and then you know so they left with buses and I was coming at the end to make sure that everybody was already there so I come in the end and as you go there is a huge slide they can have bring people from somewhere and I don't know whatever floor all the way down and I come and I see one very respected scientist stands there barefoot and she's pulling out by the leg and not afraid it because he was a little stuck in that in that slide and then from there it just went finding and finding her and they put me to go through some tunnel and then we're taking pictures and we're making some crazy comments some of them are online so I was in this tube crawling through the tube so somebody made a comment say agent 007 crawling through lymphatic vessels and things scientists like you said many of them are quite funny and they could be very serious and very much into our problems but then usually when they get together and many often it's with trainees and with positive sense students and what's not right I mean we let it go a little bit and then it's funny it's entertaining and it's also a little court easy. Definitely I think the city museum is amazing I've been there myself. So you know them together. Yeah I think it really highlights the sense of humor in that sense of camaraderie which I think is so important in science because you are facing some tough challenges solving some difficult problems in the lab every day and I know oftentimes you only unfortunately things like funding staff technology feasibility etc etc hold you back but if we took away the barriers what is the one research question that you would want to answer most. I still think that again brain is defined as the immune privilege and we know to understand what it means but if you ask 10 people they will give you 11 different answers but the idea that the brain has unique status with immune system and so even though now we know they do interact with the interactive particular degree not like every other one and the mechanisms to explain why this is so was with two levels of information one level was the blood vessels within the brain have a unique barrier called blood brain barrier and immune cells cannot really easily cross that barrier or cause barrier at all and you don't have immune cells in the brain well that is not right so this is not true and there are many labs who showed that if you are activating in cells in a particular way and they need to get into the brain they will definitely cross that barrier so that's not explanation and the other misconception was that we do not have lymphatic vessels anywhere in the brain and therefore there is no direct physical communication between the brain and the immune system that is also incorrect as I told you we discovered lymphatic vessels around the brain it's server the brain about 10 years ago so now two major underlying mechanisms to the question of why brain is been logically unique are not correct so what is it that allows us to very very unique interaction between the brain and the immune system why cancers in the brain are not rejected if we do have lymphatic drainage and if immune cells can cross the barriers so why don't cancers in the brain get rejected as efficiently as they are in the periphery why cartisels don't work gets brain tumors right so why even checkpoint inhibitor therapies are not working for brain tumors so this is still a very big question which we have a paper coming probably next week or maybe in two weeks online that can get a little bit at it we are providing a new level of mechanism so basically brain stands this unique valve derived molecules to present the immune system and when the immune system reacts to them they generate immune cells which are more of suppressor than inflammatory cells so normally immune response are either affectors cells so they go after their target or they are more of regulatory cells so they're more suppressor and regular immune response and so these molecules this brain derived peptides are inducing more of regulatory immune response which has never been shown before so we call them guardian peptides so these are self-derived proteins coming from the brain and for whatever reasons which we're showing in this paper are inducing this very different and very unique suppressor immune response and of course in disease conditions they disappearing and potentially one way to help with the neuroinflammatory conditions is to restore those states so this is one very important layer but I don't think it explains the whole thing so if I could have one answer I would love to understand that and of course the question is how can we efficiently treat neurological disorders I believe in immune therapy for brain disorders but what should be our target cell again we're focusing in particular cell types of T cells but is this the right target cell while it's A target cell is this D target cell if I had a magic wand and I had one question I would of course ask what are the mechanisms for CNS immune tolerance or immune privilege if I had two I would ask okay which cells I should going after to develop the best the most successful the most promising even therapy for brain disorders well you only I think this is all fascinating and listeners will have to keep an eye out for this upcoming paper and we've talked about a lot of different things today I'd love to wrap up by just touching on advice so for listeners out there who might be on their own scientific journeys what advice would you give them that perhaps helped you along your own journey so the advice I give everybody is not listen to anybody's devices and I think it's a very important thing to realize because there are people who love to give advice and often they confuse advice with order and in your advice and then if you don't follow they are getting upset with you by if you follow my advice we also enjoy remember right so sometimes we're looking at people are saying oh my god he's your sheer so successful I want to be like her like him let me ask them what are they doing it I said so people go and say so what do you do how do you succeed first of all is success is a very real-term what's successful I don't know I think you could be successful today because you got some really amazing results and tomorrow you're not successful because the data isn't a producing for example right so success is an arbitrary unit in my opinion but let's say you say okay I would love to be like that person and so you go and you ask them for advice then tell you whatever they do for example I have the luxury during the day I can spend time and meet my people in the lab with postdocs for the graduate students discuss with them ideas go talk all kind of meetings and at night I am very functional and so I can actually do a lot of work done during night time but if I give this advice to somebody who absolutely needs eight or nine hours of sleep and who absolutely cannot function in the evening and then try to follow my advice they will collapse within a couple of weeks so I think everybody has intuition you just need to listen to your inner voice and if the universe tells you to not do something or to not go that way and that maybe it's not for you I think you should listen to it if all the signs are saying no then maybe you're saying yes maybe you should listen this listen a little bit more to your inner voice and I really believe that if you are not excited about the project that you're doing about scientific question you are asking I'm not saying it's impossible to do science and do it well I just think it will be very very difficult because of all the failures that you will encounter that we discussed before so listen to your inner voice don't listen to many other devices and just try to always the ask yourself is this the right path for you is this my calling I love it I think that's a wonderful message for our listeners is there any other last note of inspiration you'd like to leave everybody with at the end of our conversation today no just please create this book and the imperfection in science and even in life I think it's okay it's fine to be a little bit imperfect sir Peter Medowar who is normal or yet as well who also wrote a bunch of books and other books and other things that was mentioned to you this called a device to young scientists by Peter Medowar I guess that probably was mentioned before so there he says that it's very important to planet experiment and put it well and think but at the end of the day it's important to get up go do the experiment fail and then plan better and then fail better and then do it again you can't just see there in planet experiments forever it's okay to do things and it's okay to make mistakes and if you work in an environment that is not mistake per misive then I think it's our own environment for you mistakes should be allowed everyone makes mistakes even daily polymerizing makes mistakes sometimes well yoni that is a wonderful note and if our listeners would like to learn more about you and more about the work that you do what is the best way for them to do so well unfortunately there is a lot of information about me on twitter and on some other social media but there is a lot of publications for people who read scientific literature there is also I think obviously scientific American couple of years ago people can read that so I think there's enough material unfortunately online about the lab and what we do in the lab and what ex-lab trainees are now doing in their own labs which is also another source of exploration for me people who are trained with me and are now independent on doing some read exceptional science perfect well listeners definitely check out these resources and yoni thank you so much for joining us on the show it was such a pleasure to chat with you today thank you very much for having me my pleasure yoni and listeners thank you so much for spending time with us today we hope you join us again for the next episode of people behind the science
