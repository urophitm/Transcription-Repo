Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hanafri's Cocktail Hour. Make sure you're wearing headphones for the best possible experience. This should be your right ear, and this should be your left ear. Today we are going to be making a classic, the Mahido. The Mahido is a very simple list of ingredients starting off with a cut lime. You want to take half a lime as I'm cutting through it. The smell of freshly zest lime is filling the room. And neatly slice it into four pieces and plop them inside your glass. Add to that around ten fresh mint leaves. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Lovely. The next step is to take your pestle and crush all of the oil out of those deliciously fresh mint leaves. And get lots of juice out of your limes. By the end, you want to have created a delicious fragrant pulp in the bottom of your glass. The next stage is to add some sugar. You'll have some options here, but if you want your Mahido to taste as delicious as possible, I recommend just ordinary white castor sugar. Two teaspoons will do. A little more, if like me, you'll have a sweet tooth. Get your pestle again. And off you go. Next, it's time to throw in some ice. Crushed ice is best, but if that's not available, normal ice will do. Just fill your glass all the way to the top. Now it's time to add your rum. Be as generous as the occasion deserves. Next, take a standard cocktail spoon and give everything a good mix in together. Finally topping off with a good splash of soda water. One last little stir. And your Mahido is ready to drink. Cheers! Delicious!
