You can also send guest recommendations via email to contact at peoplebehindtheScience.com. Now today we are looking forward to speaking with Joel about his life and science. So get ready to meet another one of our phenomenal people behind the science. Every day discoveries are made that will change our understanding of the world around us. Dr. Marie McNeely is here to bring you the brilliant minds who are making these discoveries so they can share their incredible stories and take you on an amazing journey. Welcome to People Behind the Science. Hello everyone and welcome to People Behind the Science. Listeners today I am delighted to introduce you all to Dr. Joel Sacks. So Joel, welcome to our program today. How are you? I'm great. I'm happy to be here. Well we are happy to have you with us today and I'm going to start our call today by telling our listeners just a little bit about you. So listeners Joel is an associate professor and vice chair of biology at the University of California Riverside. He received his PhD in Integrated Biology from the University of Texas Austin and he conducted post-doctoral research at UC Berkeley with an NIH National Research Service Award before taking his current position there at UC Riverside. Now Joel was the recipient of an NSF Career Award and he was recently awarded a National Science Foundation Dimensions of Biodeversity Research Grant and I'm looking forward to talking about some of his research today but Joel we want to know you both as a scientist but also as a person so I'd like to talk first about your life outside the lab and can you tell us what you like to do when you're not doing science? Well sure so I'm a dad I have two young kids so I spend a lot of time with my kids and my wife at home some of my favorite things to do when I'm with my family are to spend time outdoors we spend a lot of time in our yard and out hiking. Southern California has a lot of fantastic opportunities for that and probably my favorite thing to do other than spending time with my wife and children is to be out in my yard gardening and landscaping. I've been fully kind of turning my backyard into a kind of native habitat trying to get kind of the native shrubs and cactuses and other things growing there without any added irrigation so without watering which is a little bit of a challenge in Southern California. Very cool. Well I must say I wish I enjoyed this sort of yard work and those sorts of things my yard could definitely use some TLC. So now you mentioned you are a father can you tell us a little bit about your kids and what they're into these days? So I've gotten eight year old daughter Nora and she's very into reading right now she's just gotten to the point of being able to read pretty effectively on her own so she's gotten to this point where she's suddenly very fascinated by spending lots of time by herself with a book and that is deeply frustrating to her younger brother who just turned five and is just starting to recognize words and learn how to read in school. He is very into building things, destroying them and doing everything he can to emulate his big sister so he loves to dress up like a girl and follow her around but also essentially be a boy and destroy everything around him. That's awesome. Yeah. So it's great to get a window into your life outside of science but Joel I do want to talk about your work next as well so can you tell us how you describe what you do to someone who's not familiar with your field? That's a great question and it's something I really enjoy. So we study bacteria that promote plant growth. So what we're really interested in doing is understanding what makes these bacteria tick, how do they get attracted from the soil into plants and then they actually enter plant cells so we try to understand how this interaction is initiated and how the plant kind of maintains these partners and in particular we're interested in how the system can vary. Some of the bacteria we study are very beneficial. Some look to be more like kind of free riders or cheaters on the system and we try to understand how the host deals with all this diversity and invest optimally in the bacteria that will provide them with the most benefit. Very cool and now I understand especially lately you're focusing on a lot of these California plants. Does that translate into now some of your agriculture practices at home? No it hasn't done that yet but yeah for the most part our group's research is kind of divided up into two sides. One is our more substantial research is studying native plants in California and we study one species that is essentially distributed all across the state and then the other side of the research in our lab is newer and that's studying crop legumes and how they interact with some of the same lineages of bacteria. Very cool. While I look forward to chatting more about these projects as we go through the interview today but one thing I love asking all of the guests on our show about is what motivates them and I'm a collector of sayings and phrases and things that get me out of bed in the morning. So do you have a favorite quote or saying of your own? It's funny this is something my wife and I talk about a lot because I'm an extremely self-motivated person so thinking about external sources of motivation does not come naturally to me. In terms of science I find a pretty famous quote pretty motivating and by the biologist theodosius dubshanski and his quote was that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution and we studied the system where a lot of the work on it is kind of the molecular and the cell biology of this interaction how it works but I'm most fascinated thinking about how does it evolve and how did it evolve. Thinking about how a bacteria its closest relatives are soil bacteria and pathogens and at what point and how did it gain the ability to actually get into a plant cell and provide the plant with this just incredible service to the plant that the plants really can't get on its own. So thinking about that evolutionary story and how that happened and how this interaction is kind of maintained is really fascinating to me. Definitely and I think it makes you think about like you said kind of this story behind the research that you're studying and that's part of what I really like is just this storytelling aspect in science that I think a lot of people take for granted. Yeah that's right I agree. So now we talked a little bit about your career in our introduction in terms of the steps you took to get there but I think in so many cases the people who helped you get there maybe don't go as recognized as they should. So do you have any particular mentors or role models or maybe inspirational figures that you looked up to that helped you along your own career? Many and I could go on and on starting with my first college professor who taught me about evolutionary biology. His name was Roger Milkman. He's since passed away and he was just an inspiring teacher that got you very excited about evolution and before that course I was really focused on going into research maybe related to cancer or some other kind of medically related research and I was just totally inspired by that class and got me into this idea that you could be a biologist and just study fundamental questions about how do all these organisms work, how did they get to be, how they are, how do they interact etc. So that was really inspiring. Probably closer to my heart I can think back to my PhD advisor that's a very intimate relationship that evolves over the span of a PhD and he was very good at a role I'm continually trying to learn of show don't tell. He would never give advice by just telling you something but he would show you something and he would very occasionally make kind of off-hand suggestions. If I had written them all down his off-hand suggestions are essentially ideal career advice and one of his pieces of advice he was always trying to instill was to do basic research meaning answering questions based on curiosity just trying to understand how the universe works that's a big part of research but then also thinking about translational research trying to solve problems that can better help humanity solve medical problems ecological problems environmental problems etc. And that's kind of more where my most recent work has had it is kind of spanning back gap doing both basic and translational research. Certainly and I know that translational research can be sometimes easier to communicate people have you found that there's sort of a balancing act between not favoring the translational research when you tell people about what you do. Yeah it's interesting there's such diverse perceptions among many biologists the idea of doing applied research there's kind of a snottiness about it and that well why would you bother doing that it's so much more important just to do what's described as fundamental or basic research. But you're right when you talk to a person and you'd say that you study native plants and their associated bacteria one might reasonably ask well how does that help the world and I could give them a diversity of answers from just saying that's really important just to understand how these things work in the world forever gonna use these systems or similar systems to do applications. But then there's other people but it's very easy for them to understand the applications and maybe it seems much more esoteric just to study biology out of the sake of curiosity. Absolutely well very cool that you're able to sort of dabble in both of those different areas both the basic research and the translational and applied work and I'm curious though Joel where this interest of yours in science began do you have a particular memory of maybe the first experiment you did or the first time that you started thinking about science or maybe science as a career. Well I've always loved being outside and spent a lot of time in the woods and hiking around the area where I grew up near Chicago. In terms of science probably my first spark was in fourth grade I was lucky enough to have just a fantastic science teacher who had a PhD although in retrospect I have no idea what his PhD was in I just know he was Dr. Nelson and he would set up these classes where there were these problems to solve and I just found that really exciting just it's fourth grade so it's relatively easy but I just remember one day where he brought in a gallon of water and he said I want you guys to weigh this gallon of water and we said well that's really easy we've got the scale we're just gonna put the jug on the scale and he said well no then you're weighing the water plus the jug so we had to figure out how we could weigh the water which we solved relatively quickly but then that evolved into thinking about much more complex problems and just the steps and by doing this he introduced us to the scientific method but he did it again in the style of showing not telling he first showed us how to do it and then only afterwards did he kind of describe the terms of what a hypothesis is what a prediction is how you test a prediction etc so we already essentially were scientists and then afterwards he explained this is how real scientists do it so that was really exciting to me and at that point I said this is what I wanted to but I was on fourth grade or so it was a little bit vague you had to wait yeah very cool well I love this idea of introducing problem solving already at that level of elementary school because I think so many teachers and textbooks take the approach of sort of presenting the facts and information as we know it in a very simplified way but not really showing that science is this active process where you are problem solving actually this is something I do in all my classes usually by the end of the first lecture I have this little side discussion that I lead and I tell them that a lot of a science class is not about what we know it's not about relaying a list of facts but it's about describing what we don't know and this is an idea that it's sometimes deeply confusing to students but showing that science is actively happening all the time and it's important to explain to them these are the key gaps in our knowledge here the things that we understand but here is the edge of our understanding and here these things remain unsolved and to some students they look at that and they find that deeply frustrating and see it as a limitation to science but why haven't you figured this out yet but for many students I think they see this as inspiring and they realize oh there's all this room for me to go out and discover new things myself and maybe be a scientist or do something related to discovery so I hope that more students are in that second group that get inspired by that absolutely and now you mentioned that you had this sort of epiphany and the fourth grade level already that you are interested in science can you take us from fourth grade enthusiastic about science Joel to where you are today and tell us about some of these key transitional moments so I have a very atypical science career and to some degree I think it speaks of the kind of flexibility that you are allowed in science if you're willing to take the risks so when I started like I described as an undergraduate I was really fascinated by medical research and solving problems but then I took this evolutionary biology class and then soon after that I took an ecology class that I also found really fascinating actually I had applied and already been accepted to graduate schools on medical research so I had done all the interviews I had talked to professors and during that period I was taking an ecology class and I was reading this book it's a pretty influential book in conservation biology and it's called the Fand County Almanac by all the Leopold it's a pretty inspirational book was written in the 1940s and it was during this period when conservation biology was just kind of starting like at that point a conservation biologist might be somebody that goes out into the woods and shoots wolves just to get rid of them and only then where they started to realize but maybe that was not the best thing to do getting rid of top predators so I was reading this book and I found it really inspiring and it just kind of woke up inside me all these interests that I've been having for years and made me really question why I was going to graduate school and spend five or six or more years studying more medically related things so that was when I decided that I had made a mistake and that I couldn't go to those programs but it made me realize I really needed some time to think and sort out what I wanted to do so I called up the school where I was planning on going and told them I couldn't go and it was only a couple months later that actually told my parents about that position they were oh wow yeah they were a little bit shocked but in the interim I found myself a job in a neuroscience lab this was at the University of Iowa where I had done my undergrad so I had good employment and I worked in that lab for almost two years before starting graduate school I initially got a master's degree and I actually studied social interactions in birds I was really fascinated by birds at that point I still am but it's more of an avocation at this point so I did this master's and I was studying these social birds and how they nest in these groups and how that evolves it was all very fascinating but it was also deeply frustrating to do fieldwork and spend months and months chasing these birds in a kayak occasionally being able to capture them and get blood from them and tag their feet and then I also did a little bit of lab work too and I realized that I was deeply fascinated by the questions I was addressing but that the methods I was using it was just very difficult to study birds. I have to laugh because I tried to study birds and undergrad too and have the same frustration I hate misnets I can't get them out I'm yeah. Yeah. So for example the basic question we were asking is why do birds form groups and there's really some benefits to forming groups and in this case it was groups of nests that are close together but there are costs too and the main cost is there's competition they have to compete over food other resources there's the potential to compete over mates and most birds are highly territorial they really spread out so that was the question I was addressing and we tried to make this experiment of essentially creating a set of nests at different spaces apart these were birds that nest over water and we created this whole kind of matrix of nests this is when the birds were beginning to migrate back to the lake where we study them and essentially the birds completely ignored our experiment and just stayed out of that whole area where they had been nesting in previous years. Oh no. We spent all this time creating this experiment and the bird said no way. No thank you. Yeah so it was on many rainy days during fieldwork when we couldn't be out in our kayaks I would sit in my little trailer where I lived and I would read papers and that's where I started reading a lot about microbes and I realized I could ask all these questions in organisms that were very simple where I could grow them in the lab where I could grow their hosts whether their hosts were insects or plants in the lab where people were starting just beginning to sequence genomes and understand the genetics of the host and all these things that would just be near impossible for study in birds it was during that time that I was already planning what I wanted to do for my PhD and realizing that although birds were a lot of fun that I needed to do something that was more practical where I could really kind of crack the nuts I wanted to crack and get more things done in a reasonable amount of time. Absolutely well I love this story because I think it points to you this idea that you don't have to know exactly what you want to do when you start this career path and I think that's so important to impress upon young and future scientists because there's a lot of pressure from you see all your classmates who seem like they have it all figured out or you talked to your professors and you don't often hear these stories of how they got to where they are and I think that is really important that you can pause you can stop to kind of try some different things and figure it out before just jumping into that PhD. That's right but there are costs and when you switch from one field to another you're suddenly starting from ground zero both in terms of the depth of knowledge of that field and then also your reputation in that field so that kind of flexibility can be very exciting and I feel like I've gained some benefits from perspectives from multiple organisms and multiple fields but also the hurdle to the shifting to a new field is difficult and sometimes somebody will look at my CV and they say what you studied birds or what happened yeah you did this research on a jelly fixture your PhD that was a part of the story I skipped over so there are costs too but you're right and that is something I try to impress upon younger students even college freshman will come in and sometimes they feel stressed out but they don't know what they're going to be when they grow up and I say sometimes I feel that way. I won't admit that I'm grown up yet as too early yeah oh very cool well great to hear a little bit about your at journey at Joll and I know you're there at the University of California Riverside today and you're doing some really exciting work we touched on it just a little bit in the beginning of the interview but is there a particular project you want to dive into in a little bit more detail and tell us about. Yeah so one thing we're really excited about is really studying the bacteria that we study studying them on a much broader and deeper level than has ever really been done before and I'll give you an example one field of research in which a great deal of effort and resources has gone into is studying human pathogens in particular a handful of viruses like HIV or influenza and a handful of bacteria like staphlococcus and these things that are really harmful such as some strands of E. coli and in the field of epidemiology one of the approaches to understanding what makes these viruses or bacteria tick is just to gather lots and lots of isolates of these microbes and to know something about each isolate so for example for influenza we know that some strains are incredibly harmful we know that some strains have this ability to jump from host to host we know that some strains only infect birds or only infect pigs we know that others have the ability to jump from pigs to humans and then most recently we can then sequence all their genes and try to figure out more about the mechanisms like what makes this particular strain that swept through all of North America in a amount of two weeks what makes it tail and thus how can we stop it or how can we create therapies so what we want to do and are just beginning to do in our lab is to do the same thing for beneficial bacteria that are infecting plants both in natural environments and also in agricultural fields we want to understand their epidemiology but essentially everything is flipped over now we want to understand what makes the beneficial strains spread in this case through an agricultural field or a natural population of plants what are the strains that have this ability to really spread from host to host and also just persist in the very harsh environment of the soil so this is something where it's just a fundamental question of evolutionary biology it's a question of what makes something fit what are the strains that have this high reproductive success but it's also a question that's really germane to translational biology what are the strains that maybe we could develop and use to promote growth of plants in agricultural situations the bacteria we study fix nitrogen so they're giving plants the key limiting resource of nitrogen and this is a potential way that we could grow plants without using chemical nitrogen as fertilizer and one of the things we've realized in the past couple decades is that the process of generating chemical nitrogen through the haybered botch process is just really damaging the fossil fuel costs are pretty dramatic and then the downstream costs on our environment are really bad nitrogen is one of our biggest sources of pollution as a species so anything we can do to reduce that and make crops more sustainable would just be a really positive step so that's what I'm really excited about right now or at least one of the things well very cool project Joel and I know you sort of touched on the importance of the bacteria's ability to not only spread but also to persist in tough conditions and I know out there in California drought is a big consideration so is this something that you're specifically looking at as well yeah that's right I'm not sure if we're specifically looking at it but it's something that we're really fascinated with one of the things we know our bacteria must do is persist in the soil for many months when that soil's very dried out and essentially wait for rains to come for their host plant to start growing and then they could invade the roots of that host plant so for example we just completed here on Riverside nine and a half months where we had no significant precipitation wow so I think the largest precipitation over that nine and a half months was 200th of an inch so what that means is that these bacteria are living in very desiccated soil for some bacteria they can sporulate and create a form that is resistant to that kind of drying but the bacteria that we study don't have that ability so we think that that drying out is something in that ability to persist in that is probably a really important trait now as climate change plays out and we have longer phases like this that's certainly going to have pretty dramatic effects on plant communities and also the bacteria so one thing that's really exciting is there's been a lot of work that can show that microbes can really promote drought tolerance in plants we have a new graduate student that just came in who's collaborating with my group and another group that studies plant physiology and that's the question he's addressing is to what degree can bacterial infection actually promote drought tolerance so I'm pretty excited about that work too well that is phenomenal great to hear a little bit more about some of the work going on in your lab job and I know we touched on some of the challenges that you faced with your early field work projects and I love talking about these challenges in science because I think these stories are often untold so I love when guests on our program share some of their own failures challenges and these tough times that they've worked through because I think it is so important for the world at large to really get a realistic view of life as a scientist so do you have a favorite failure or challenge you want to tell us about today oh my gosh there's so many I mean one of the things that I often tell my graduate students will remind them is that failure is temporary and they're just going to have to try again there's so many failures there's so many experiments and I actually have a whole folder on my computer where I keep files of failed experiments and sometimes I'll go back and look at them and remind myself what went wrong and why we stopped doing that experiment or sometimes we'll pull a folder out of that failure pile and try it again and occasionally it's successful but sometimes it still fails for me I think back to some of my initial work and studying birds the story that I told you is one example so more recently we were really interested in trying to create transgenic strains of bacteria so bacteria that contained combinations of genes from different parental strains now that's something you can do you can engineer genomes in the lab and there's all sorts of techniques to do that but what we were interested in doing was harnessing the bacteria's natural ability to exchange genes because one thing we realized in our bacteria just by studying their genetics you realize that these bacteria are naturally transmitting what we describe as little concepts of genes one strain to another and we really want to understand the ecology of that gene transfer so I had a graduate student who worked on this for almost two years of her PhD and we were absolutely convinced it was going to work that we were going to recapitulate these gene transfers in the lab and then we could study how they occurred and the downstream genetic effects of these new transfers. It all occurred on paper right? Yeah so we knew this was happening in the soil and we knew the conditions or we had a good idea of the conditions under which these transfers should occur and we had a large diversity of strains to test it on and we designed this whole experiment and we replicated in lots of different strains and after about a year and a half we finally just gave up and we realized this is not going to work and for my graduate student I'll never forget the day where we finally reached that point of failure she was incredibly ambitious that she was the kind of student who really never said no I'm done she kept on pushing it and I finally said we have got to drop this project it's not your failure it's our failure it's not you it's the project yeah and I think she was just waiting for me to say that finally say okay it's okay we can drop this we can move on and we actually did learn a lot from that project and it spurred other projects some of the failed results but yeah it's in that folder on my computer failed experiments and maybe it'll stay there forever but it was still useful we did learn a lot along the way well I love this idea of chronicling things in this failure folder I think that's a good reminder to kind of look back and say okay well this failure wasn't as bad as that one so we're okay that's right well it can be tough to make that decision of when to kind of pull the plug on a project so what finally did it for this year and a half long struggle that's a good question I feel like my important role as the professor in a group the principal investigator is somebody comes to me and they have a question how do I set up this experiment or this isn't working what do you think I should do next there's all sorts of questions like that and I feel like one thing that makes me successful or confident in that regard is that I always have a list of two or three ideas maybe we should do this or maybe we should do that and it's always a discussion it's never me telling the student do this or do that but we work on it together and then we develop ideas and with that project I had just run out of ideas we had tried everything and we got to the point of trying things that we had already tried before and covering ground just to double check and once we got to that point of just running out of ideas then I said okay we really need to drop the retire to the failure folder so we were very persistent it's not often that we get to that point sometimes we've dropped things quickly and say okay this doesn't look that interesting let's move on but with that project we were so excited by the idea that we really took it to its logical conclusion certainly well Joel we don't just want to talk about the difficult times in lab so next I'd like you to share with us a story of success whether it was a big win or a small win but one that was really meaningful yeah this was work that a graduate student did and it was worked that kind of evolved over a long period of time and we only completed it very recently several years after he had finished his PhD so this relates to how plants can regulate different strains of bacteria so we're kind of interested in symbiosis in a general way so all plants all animals of course this includes us we house all sorts of microbes thousands and thousands of strains some of them are good some of them are bad and the complexity is that we have all sorts of diverse systems to try to invite in and promote the good strains and punish the bad strains that's kind of a simplistic way of describing it our understanding now is that our immune system is a big part of this we have a great deal of understanding of how our immune system is great at getting rid of or minimizing the effects of pathogens and now we're starting to understand how it can also invite and reward symbionts so we study that in plants and what we're really interested in doing is understanding how this happens at the very cellular level so in our bacteria what they do is they infect the plant root and they essentially instigate the plant to form this extra growth that it wouldn't normally form and when you look at these plant roots from they're infected they look like they have these tumors on them we call the tumors nodules but they're really similar to a tumor there's a proliferation of plant cells and in this case those plant cells are just packed with bacteria they're filled with bacteria and you can slice them open and look at them under the microscope and you can see individual plant cells that are just jam packed with bacteria there's almost no plant material left in those cells just bacteria so we were really interested in understanding what's happening within those cells and how are those plants keeping the good guys better helping them in those cells and how are they getting rid of the bad guys so we had a student who had gone out and isolated lots and lots of strains of these bacteria from natural environments and then grew them up in the lab and tested individual strains on sterile plants so then he could say here's the effect of this strain it causes the plants to grow it's a good strain we would describe it as a mutualist it's providing benefits to the plant but then he also discovered strains that were not beneficial that would infect the plants and that those nodules those little tumors on the roots would grow but the bacteria wasn't helping the plant at all in fact it was sucking resources from the plant so we might call these parasites or cheaters so then he designed a set of experiments where he was co-infecting plants where he'd give the plant a good strain and a bad strain and then he would look at what happens within the nodules of these plants and what he discovered is that occasionally you could find that individual nodules would house both the good strain and the bad strain and he discovered what these look like under the microscope and I'll never forget the day he started bringing these slides of what some of these nodules look like and you could literally see the part of the nodule where the good bacteria were and the part of the nodule where the bad bacteria were and what he was able to show is that the plant was able to punish the bacteria that were not fixing nitrogen that were not being helpful by essentially killing those plant cells that plants have a program it's similar to program cell death where they're essentially causing those cells to undergo a synestimus process so it's sacrificing those cells but in the process it appears to be killing the bacteria inside those cells so he did a lot of really elegant microscope work and a lot of really elegant experiments and it was in collaboration with other people in my lab as well and some collaborators elsewhere but it was work that just took about six years to develop all the different parts to where we finally had enough data to publish something that kind of completed the story but that's something I'm incredibly proud of kind of mentoring him through the process and he's still a good friend of mine and just really excited about having all those data out there that we really made some progress on understanding how the plants do this. Certainly now you mentioned that moment where you kind of first started seeing these slides and that first exposure to the visual evidence where you can actually see it right in front of you what's going on here is so powerful so what was going through your mind then? Yeah that's right I mean a lot of evolutionary biology you're gathering data and then looking at numbers, looking at what's the count of bacteria in a nodule or how much has this plant grown or what has happened and seeing a picture of a nodule was just incredibly exciting because you're seeing a snapshot of what's actually happening so much of biology is really imagination you see numbers and then you imagine what's actually happening and we call that imagination a hypothesis prediction but really it's about having your imagination of what's actually happening and when you're seeing a picture of something in full color of what's actually happening inside of a cell then there's really this kind of a-ha moment where you think oh our idea was right this is really consistent with our idea it really supports this idea of what we think is happening and there's something just really exciting and gratifying about that because a big part of being a scientist is just being incredibly skeptical and just self-doubting because it's very easy to have an idea and then favor data that is in support of that idea and kind of ignore data that might be inconsistent with your idea so this was the first set of experiments where we had done my cross-breath so we had to really learn how to do it learn how to preserve plant tissue learn how to cut these very thin sections and take good pictures and stain them properly and that took a while so it was just very exciting to kind of confirm these ideas that we had inkling of and to show that we shouldn't maybe be so doubtful about ourselves absolutely well congratulations Joel to you and your lab on this exciting success in talking about your career path you mentioned the book sand county almanac as an influential book in your own career path and I love sharing book recommendations with our listeners out there so I'll definitely add this one to the list but are there any other books you'd like to recommend for us today a book that I recently read we were visiting my in-laws my wife's family for unhappy reasons my father-in-law had passed away so we all went to Pittsburgh where my wife's family is and spent a lot of time there and they have kind of a vast library in their house they're all just really solid book readers and my kids were taking a nap and it was pretty quiet so I described a book off the shelf and I grabbed this book called the double helix James Watson wrote this book one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA it was Watson Crick back in 1953 and in this book he kind of tells his own version of the story of discovery now he's a highly controversial character both for some of the things that he says currently but also there's controversy about the discovery of DNA of whether Watson Crick stole some data from Roslyn Franklin she died unfortunately relatively young of breast cancer and whether she should have shared in the Nobel Prize but Watson and Crick and Maurice Wilkins got and it was very fascinating to read this book in some ways you can tell if you know the outside parts of the story that he's not always the most reliable narrator and if you know anything about his personality you gain a lot from reading this book so it's not only fascinating scientifically to read the book and kind of follow how they made this really monumentous discovery but it's also a really fascinating story of a very strong and persistent personality and that's something that you see a lot in science very strong persistent personalities and sometimes that is great and you need that to be hardworking and to solve a problem but then that's also maybe a negative too if you want to be able to functionally deal with other human beings in the world so that's a great book. Well I will say that was a wonderful description and very delicate I like that you you could have been a politician Joel my goodness yeah maybe we will definitely add double he looks to our reading list on our website there and we've talked a little bit about some of your experiences in your career Joel and one of the things we haven't really touched on too deeply yet are some of the opportunities that you've had to travel for science and this is one of the wonderful aspects of the career that many people may not be aware of so I love sharing travel stories on our program so do you have a favorite place that science has taken you? I can think of two different stories one is during the early part of my graduate career I had a great opportunity to go to the tropics and take a tropical biology course and I'd listen to Costa Rica in 1996 and that was really one of the first times that I traveled very far away from home was certainly the first time that I'd been to the tropics and for anyone who loves the outdoors the tropics are just absolutely inspiring to seeing the kind of diversity and seeing places that are just totally dominated by organisms that you've never seen before just the diversity of plants and insects really blew me away closer to current times we spent so much time growing our plants in these chest very sterile and contrived conditions in sterile pouches or in these little growth tubes or more realistically in these bigger pots than a greenhouse but when spring comes around and we go out into the fields to collect plants or collect seeds of plants or to culture back to here from wild plants the places where our plants grow are just beautiful amazing places in the field sites where we choose to sample them we try to get as far from humanity as possible and my favorite is a field site called Anza Barrego which is Desert State Park pretty close to the border of Mexico and it's just a vast area that when it does rain is just unbelievably lush surrounded by high mountains often with snow with an incredible community of plants it's just really beautiful place that turns into a rainbow for about three or four weeks a year and then it's brown but still beautiful for the remainder of the year so that's the place where we go and we're kind of reminded about what our plants are actually doing out nature as opposed to all these weird things for work dissecting them and growing them and right little machines and things like that yeah it's nice because you can control everything the plants behave very well in the lab however it is nice to kind of make that connection in nature and see them in their natural environment too I think yeah that's exactly right and what you just said is exactly why study plants because you can do both those things you can grow thousands of them and there's none of the concerns that I would have if I was studying an animal where I'd be worried about harming it or ethical things we can grow thousands of plants and then the end of the experiment we just compost them and it smells relatively nice and we have no bad feelings about that at all yeah absolutely well thanks so much for sharing some of your scientific travels and and kind of our discussion today we've talked about some of the different people you've had an opportunity to work with over the years and I think to some of the people who you meet in science are just absolutely wonderful creative fun funny sorts of people and that's not exactly the image that a lot of people get in their mind when they think about a scientist so I love breaking some of the stereotypes that people have by sharing this human side of science and talking about some of the quirky traditions and the fun and funny things that scientists do in there together so do you have your own story of this human side of science that you want to share with us today well transition to what we're just talking about so one of the things that we'll often do is these very large experiments or we'll grow hundreds or sometimes a couple thousand of plants in a greenhouse and why we're growing that many plants is because we're studying relatively small effects small effects of anoculating plants with different strains and bacteria or growing the plants under slightly different conditions to study those effects so we need a lot of replication and then setting up those experiments is labor intensive but the real labor comes when we do what's called a harvest and that's we bring in all the plants the lab hundreds or thousands and then we very carefully but also quickly dissect them pull out the parts where the bacteria are occasionally culture them or simply dissect those different parts out photograph them and weigh them to test their different hypotheses and this part is incredibly labor intensive and also time sensitive we have to do it fast so that the plants aren't sitting around in the lab or the greenhouse causing even more variation than we want so this is a process where we just bring in is everyone that's working in the lab we bring in all the apprentices we can bring in and we all work really hard together and sometimes this leads to very very long days doing very unpleasant backbreaking the section of these plants and that inspires all sorts of kind of wacky behavior especially as these harvest go on sometimes for days or even weeks and two years ago it did this experiment but two graduate students described as the great harvest of I think it was 2016 and when they do a fundraiser they might have like a chart where you're getting a thermometer you want the thermometer to go all the way to the top once they raise enough money oh yeah yeah the graduate students created this chart like this is for every plant that they harvested it and they slowly filled it in and everything became crazier and crazier in the lab I would kind of walk in and people would seem kind of giddy and maybe even punch drunk slowly back away yeah yeah and when everyone was done it was funny because they did more of the work than me I was mostly sitting at my computer probably writing the next grant proposal everyone kind of disappeared from the lab for about five days after that was done I think everyone was just so exhausted that they didn't want to come in they kind of imposed their own little spring break that they had not told me about so yeah I really appreciate all the people that I get to work with really hard working people people that are really passionate about what to do and perhaps most importantly they all work together really well so that makes my workplace really pleasant and really enjoyable and it's inspiring to see how hard these people work absolutely and I think that's so important I think these all hands-on deck moments in science for everyone's really pushing at the end for a goal and I love the idea of having met thermometers you can track the progress to there's a light at the end of the tunnel but yes very cool well we've added about some of your different research projects Joel and I think oftentimes for scientists things like funding and staff and technology feasibility and time keep them from answering the questions that they really really want to know the answers to so if today I gave you whatever you asked for is there one question that you would really really want to tackle I think one of the things I talked about about the epidemiology really going out and studying a bacterial population in depth that's something that we were lucky enough to get this new grant that is very generous and will allow us to tackle that problem head on and with some good resources but I feel that even with those very generous federal funds I'm not sure if it'll be enough to really go out and sample enough to study the population in depth and that's something where it's difficult to kind of make those trade-offs to figure out how many samples do we get how much do we culture how much do we sequence how much genetic data do we gather and all that is just going to be dependent on how many people are working in the lab and how many dollars we can spend on resources and really tough trade-offs so that's something where if resources were unlimited we could just hit the problem 100 fold or a thousand fold and those are the kind of resources that are currently going into studying pathogens and for good reasons I wouldn't say that I would want billions in funding that doesn't make sense but yeah that's a problem where we really are limited even having just gotten this generous grant and having more funds we could really tackle that problem more completely. Absolutely and I think even looking at some of these big grants some people sort of roll their eyes when they see these large numbers like oh you can't answer it with even the millions of dollars that you're getting but that money goes very quickly in science when you're paying all of the salaries of the people who work in the lab all the equipment that you need and all the reagents and things like that I think people don't realize that like business science isn't expensive endeavor. Yes it is and the main thing is the people that's where a lot of the money goes and that's the majority is just the personnel and those are all the people that are doing the work and for graduate students they can either teach during graduate school or you can pay them all these additional funds through a grant so that they can spend all their time doing research which is much more productive but is very expensive so yeah you're absolutely right. Well thanks for dreaming big with us today Joel and one thing that I'd love for you to do for our listeners out there is share some advice with them today at the end of our program here so is there one piece of advice that you received at some point in your career that you really found helpful and want to pass on to our listeners. Just something we talked about briefly before this idea that failure is absolutely a temporary state of mind that you get to a point of having a failure and you just step right past it and it doesn't mean that you ignore what led to the failure and it doesn't mean that you're not learning from it but you just forge right on ahead and you don't really let it stop you in that process. Science is something and this is probably the hardest thing about science is that there is a lot of failure and often scientists think about switching to some other career where you could just go and do something that you know how to do but it's a two-edge sword because in science when you're doing something that's really exciting you're also really winging it you're really doing something that nobody's done before which by definition means that you don't really know how to do it. They're likely to failure as high. Yeah and you really don't know how it's going to work out right so it's really tough to trade off and it means you have to be comfortable with a lot of failure and you have to work really hard not to take it personally and believe it or not but something you can develop a much tougher skin and experience of just accepting failure and brushing it off and I think you can really work at that. There's room for improvement there for just about anybody. Excellent advice now. Is there any other last piece of advice you want to give us or a last note of inspiration you'd like to end our conversation on today, Joel? Yeah it's all really inspiring talk here at UC Riverside when I first got here and it was a professor who was talking about this exact issue we started our conversation whether you should do applied work or fundamental work and his inspiration was that you shouldn't ever have that internal debate but you can just do both and you can bridge that gap and I remember hearing that talk and thinking oh that's really exciting and now 10 years later I feel like I'm just beginning to really achieve. You're doing it. Yeah 10 years later it took me a while but yeah I think that's something I think about and I really try to spread that to other people because often scientists will really page and hold themselves to find themselves like I'm a pure scientist I do basic research or I do applied work and I don't think you need to do that so for me personally I find that really inspiring because it lets me have more freedom and the kind of projects I want to do and the kind of goals I want to have in my lab. Wonderful. Well great advice to pass on to our listeners. Can you tell them if they want to learn more about you and the wonderful work that you're doing? Where should they go or how should they contact you? We have a website at UC Riverside, I also have a separate website which is just www.saxlab.com and anyone who's interested can feel free to also email me. They can find my email on a UCR website or they could just email me.joll.sax at ucr.edu and I always get emails from people in the community occasionally people email me about a science fair project and want to come in and get help and I'm pretty open to that and that helps people with science fairs and other ideas so yeah that's great. That is awesome. Well listeners definitely check out more about Joel's work and get in touch if you have any questions and Joel thank you so much for joining us on the program today. Thank you it's been a lot of fun. Well it's been a pleasure to chat with you listeners great to have you here as well. We'll see you next time on another episode of People Behind the Science.
