 Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and I remember a time It must have been like 20 years ago by now my goodness I was a postdoctoral fellow doing research at the Institute for the Radical Physics that you see Santa Barbara And in fact, I was not doing research at the moment I was just wandering through one of the local bookstores and I saw this kid He couldn't have been more than nine or ten years old and he found a book and his eyes lit up And he got the book he ran over to his mom. It was Christmas shopping season And the kid says to his mom he says mom mom mom look we got to get this for dad It's the elegant universe. He'll love it. It's about string theory And that was the moment when I knew that super string theory or just string theory for short had entered the popular Imagination in large part thanks to Brian Greene's excellent book the elegant universe and the Nova TV special that followed it Which is a weird thing to have a theory of quantum gravity or a theory of everything which is perhaps what string theory could be To be out there in the public debated right not just you know told to people and they go, huh? That's interesting people out there on the streets have really strong opinions about string theory some love it Some are very disdainful of it. That's a weird state of being for a speculative highly technical theory in theoretical physics For some reason string theory captures the imagination One of my fellow postdocs at the ITP back in those days was Clifford Johnson who is today's guest on the Winescape podcast Clifford is an official card carrying string theorist He's written many papers on various different aspects of string theory He's even authored a book called D-brains D-brains are part of the string theory toolbox and it's a highly technical book I do not necessarily encourage you to buy it unless you were a professional physicist I do encourage you to buy Clifford's more recent book called simply the dialogues It is a graphic novel that Clifford both wrote the text for and illustrated It's a novel about people talking about science talking about physics and Suggesting the idea that sitting over coffee and talking about science is something we should all be doing That's an idea that I'm extremely sympathetic with so mostly today we'll be talking about string theory where it came from Why physicist invented it? Why so many physicists so many very very smart cookies had become incredibly entranced by string theory What is the origin of some of the criticisms of string theory out there and the state of the field today?

I'm this other thing So like how do you label yourself? I suppose string theory takes up a lot of my time or at least a lot of the things I work on Have their origins in the string theory context and yes I'm probably one of those who pushes back against being called a string theorist. I think maybe the issue is that we're We like to be defined by the questions where working on rather than the tools we're using to answer those questions You're not technology driven your exact my knowledge driven right, right? Yeah, so but nevertheless There have been strings in your papers you write right? I mean sort of what fraction of the papers you've actually written Let's say in last 10 years have been about string theory one way or the other oh Oh, probably in some sense Probably 99% of them so we're not gonna quibble So what is what is string theory and why should we care about it? That's probably another thing you hear lots of different answers from different string theorists I I tend to think of string theory as primarily our best shot right now at understanding a theory of quantum gravity the whole the old problem of trying to understand how to put together quantum physics and Gravity and one of the things about string theory that's very tantalizing is that it seems within within the way it does that It also gives you a chance of describing all the other forces of nature that we know of as well And that's something that Distinguishes string theory between from other approaches to quantum gravity. Yeah, there are other approaches to quantum gravity that Regardless of what you think of them They and you know and how successful they are they they really do seem to be mostly just a framework that is to do with the gravity and the quantum and not much else although you know Discoveries may be made. Yeah, you know, there's learned things but What does quantum mean? What does gravity mean? Why is it a whole thing to get them together? Shouldn't it be easy now? Better in mindscape listeners have listened to Carl Revelli talk about these things, but That comes from a very different place than string theory, but the motivation is similar Yeah The motivation is really Very much to do with our understanding of the observed and you know observed universe, which is that you you will be pushed into regimes where the quantum and the gravitational inevitably Have to talk to each other so so to take a step back the quantum stuff is is Traditionally to do with the rules that seem to apply for the very very small that the the devices we use computers phones things like that They all use the rules of quantum mechanics to move fundamental particles like the electron around And you know you can use it to to to to make cool things and understand how atoms work the structure of matter things like that And that seems to be all about the very small more or less But then there's a sort of regime which is to do with astrophysics and cosmology and so on and so forth Which is to do with where the dominant physics seems to be about gravity and Einstein taught us how to Understand That sort of physics With with what's called general relativity and it's all to do with the curvature of space time which you may have you may have heard of and whereas The description of quantum stuff seems to be more in terms of fundamental particles Interacting with each other in various ways and so they're very very different pictures But these pictures get driven together when you realize that for example the universe is expanding the universe expanding is observable fact and if you run that backwards if you go to earlier epochs of the universe in some sense the The gravitational stuff that Dominates the shape of the universe has to has to be understood in terms of the Particle physics type stuff the small stuff because the scales on which the physics is happening are those same scales There's very small scales. I talked about so the the the the quantum physics has to talk to the gravitational physics in ways that we We don't we don't know yet because we don't have a theory of quantum Gravity that we know works for Nature string theory is so sorry just to get it So as a relatively practical matter as these things go what you're saying is if we want to understand things like the big bang or Presently black holes we need both quantum mechanics and gravity at once and we don't yet have yeah In fact, I was gonna get to black holes That's another reason where when you when you think of the black hole as a as a thing that pops out of For example worrying about gravity You you end up with famously this thing called the The black hole horizon which is sort of this one way Membrane this place after which you pass you cannot go get go go back out and it's the famous some Black hole horizon it turns out when you apply quantum physics to that no matter what the size of the black hole is It turns out quantum physics doesn't like to play That game of of one way barriers and it tells you that there's actually a mechanism by which Quantum mechanically that one way barrier will will generate Ways of stuff getting back out that'll actually leak Energy and mass from the black hole and make the black hole begin to shrink and Ultimately in principle the black hole would would would disappear and At least you into a whole bunch of paradoxes that famously due to people like Stephen Hawking Who came up with that shrinking mechanism That tell you that you need to understand again this quantum and gravity stuff better in order to understand the fate of black holes And in some sense the fate of our understanding of quantum mechanics itself And so there are all sorts of interesting issues that begin to Not go away and become more and more annoying if you don't have a theory of quantum gravity to explain them So at some very simple level of principle the world is quantum mechanical the world has gravity So of course you need quantum gravity, but you're saying also is a relatively I keep when he's a straightforward or down to earth, but it's really not because we're talking about the big bang of black holes But as a Concrete matter there are phenomena in our universe that can't be understood without understanding quantum gravity Absolutely There are ways just to just just to blur it a little bit there are ways People do propose that maybe there are some get-out clauses and you could have gravity in Aquanemchanical world without it being quantum But that in some ways Can often end you end you're up in a place that's harder to explain than just quantizing the thing That's just gonna end in here. You don't see anything good coming out of that So that's fine and probably the motivation People are willing to accept but now why in the world would we say the right way to address this is to replace particles with little Loom substring if indeed that's what we're doing in string theory Well, so the answer is is that no one can tell you a good Principled reason why you do that it really was discovered by accident that that is at all the right thing to do or a right thing to do because we don't know if it's the right thing to do When you when you think from a particle physics perspective about what a quantum theory of gravity should look like or or a quantum theory of any interaction any interaction between Objects the particle for perspective is that there is a particle whose job it is to communicate the effects of that force and so the famous you know the electromagnetism That force the force that that governs all of chemistry and you know So is responsible for electricity and magnetism things like that that is communicated by the exchange of photons of the particle We're very familiar with it's the particle of light And and so every different kinds of force the nuclear forces have their own exchange particles and you can actually work out What the properties of the exchange force should be for gravity if you did have a quantum theory of gravity and it's called the graviton The graviton yes, and everyone always says we'll have you discover gravitons yet And I say no and we never will because they're too hard to detect But the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity convince us yeah, there are something called graviton Yeah, and so what you so what you could start doing is you could write down a theory that is a you know interacting gravitons and and you can just write down the properties of the graviton and how they should interact on on general principles And the theory just resists Making sense on its own For reasons you know various technical reasons which we don't need to go into it just stops working Pretty pretty soon you try and calculate anything sensible with it Completely for other reasons people were playing around with the idea of what if you were not looking at fundamental particles interacting quantum mechanically But you were looking at loops of string and when are we thinking then now? Sorry when were they actually back in the 60s? And The the late 60s going into the 70s for reasons to do with trying to understand nuclear physics They were thinking about this there are actual mechanisms by which You in in nuclear interactions you effectively make these things that look like strings They call flux tubes and and then they move like real physical objects and can interact and split and join and things like that So people thought it would actually be useful to write down a theory just in principle what would such a theory look like and If you so if you work it all out it actually works rather nicely And out pops something very interesting which actually at the time was a bug in the whole description Which is that these these loops of string tend to want to join their ends and become little close loops of string Where the loops you were thinking of to start in this line say yeah, they were sort of lines So they had ends at the actually the fundamental particles called quarks that that are very important in nuclear physics Would be joined by these these these things called flux tubes and they'd be the description and it was thought to be A candidate for the theory of the strong interactions that bind these quarks together and But there were there were mechanisms by which these strings just the theory tells you that they have to be allowed to do that To join those ends and become loops of string That are closed And if you if you follow that you find that those loops are string The different vibrations they can do the most basic vibration if you if you sort of squint and don't realize it's a string It's sort of it's small enough that it looks like a particle it looks just like that that particle that You would have associated with gravity What's called a spin to Massalist pose on the graviton the graviton This episode of mindscape is sponsored by better health when it comes to relationships We often hear about the red flags we should avoid But what if we focus more on looking for the green flags in friends and partners if you're not sure what green flags look like Therapy could help you identify them actively practice them in your relationships and embody the green flag energy yourself Whether you're dating married building a friendship or just working on yourself It's time to form relationships that love you back One of the great things about therapy is by looking inside yourself You can both learn to take those warning signs Seriously, but also learn to be open to new experiences and new things to know when something might be worth pursuing Better help is a fully online service that makes therapy affordable and convenient serving over 5 million people worldwide You can easily switch therapists any time at no extra cost So discover your relationship green flags with better help visit betterhelp.com slash mindscape today To get 10% off your first month.

So so it's you often get Requirements of the theory has to be consistent and you realize oh, I forgot this thing So I need to add that in or I don't have the right number of this bit compared You know the right ingredients won't put together in the right way and then and then you're done One of the remarkable things and I talk about this very fact quite a bit Which is that it's unusual historically and I think has has few Such striking precedents that you write down a theory And it says I'm going to work, but here's a list of demands For why you know what what I need in order to work and that list of demands and sends you off in this completely different direction And one of them was that it has to if you write down these These these these loops of string It has to have this this spin-to particle that People then realize later on with the graviton Which was the reason it was a problem is because there was no such particle in the in the strong interaction I don't know one way to describe they didn't want that so it looked like a big fail Um and it was Um, but the particle the the theory did some other things as well Really unprecedented says it doesn't actually work very well If you try and have it in our three spatial plus one time dimensions It actually starts telling you that Actually, I'm going to work really well if I work in actually started out being in 26 dimensions And then there are better versions of it that work in 10 dimensions Which is another obvious bug So this theory has very strong union representation and they have a lot of demand before they get to work So 26 dimensional space time and you need to have gravity in it and Weaker minds than ours would have said well, let's do something else exactly And um, well not only let's do something else, but something else did come along a better theory for describing the strong interactions called quantum chromodynamics came along And and so people were very happy to not have to deal with this list of demands It turns out that there were some people who thought this was really interesting Um, notably uh John Schwartz and George Shirk they said hey maybe this theory Is is good for something else um these bugs are actually a feature Um, and we've been using this thing for something else and this is a great example of something that I actually think is really important in Not just in physics, but generally speaking if people are working on a thing As as as you know with as much integrity as possible just trying to do an interesting thing and develop an idea It may often turn out that it's not necessarily good for the thing they thought it was going to be for but it often can have users elsewhere And um and certainly in science we see that a lot um In various other ways that many ideas that get recycled in various pots and have their home in places other than where they were first invented and certainly string theory seems to be an example of that Yeah, it's definitely motivation for letting smart people pursue their interests and what they think is interesting without an immediate obvious pay off right Right in the quarterly report or exactly because we're going to eventually get someplace big so yeah, so John Schwartz my Caltech colleague Joel Shirk who passed away a few years ago. Yes, was I recall So they said look gravity exists string theory seems to predict gravity So what do they do about this difficulty about making a match onto the real world? So they they've been said well maybe this this whole string theory thing is uh A theory of gravity um the uh the The high dimensional pot um is this is a suggestion that there are There are large observable dimensions that in which we live the the three spatial dimensions plus time and and and and uh they and and others that came after them It came up with mechanisms by which the extra dimensions That the string theory suggests um need to be there for the consistency of the theory Turn out to be internal degrees of freedom extra extra extra decorations that um that uh the physics has So it looks to us if you write it the right way it looks to us like a three-dimensional theory plus some extra labels if you like that um some would describe as positions in these higher dimensional spaces Um and others would say uh it's just different flavors of Particle and things like that and indeed that you can work out models if if you're if you're a string phenomenonologist someone who Build models of string theory that are attempts at representing our real world um our observed world There are very understood well-undested mechanisms by which the the higher dimensions of the string theory um End up uh Reflect uh, sorry they they end up making themselves known for example by being some of the Unexplained patterns that we actually do see in the standard model Of of of physics So so if you work out the the the list of particles that we've discovered They assembled themselves into some very interesting electron and a muon and the tail and all the neutrinos and the gals They're various families of particles that That that don't really have any explanation the the the the the standard model of particle physics describes it But does not explain where those patterns come from one thing that higher dimensions Can do is in fact give you reasons why those patterns exist right they turn out yeah, so there's We have to get rid of Well, we went from 26. I think we need to mention 10 at some point But we had to get rid of a lot of dimensions and roughly speaking we curl them up into a little tiny ball Yeah, that's basically what we do that's one way of doing it. It's not the only way But that's the way people often describing yeah off the shelf yeah standard package way of getting rid of the extra dimensions But there's more than one way of doing that and therefore there there's different there's one string theory or we'll get to that too Maybe but there's not that many flavors of string theory at the most fundamental level But there are many ways that it could manifest itself as three plus one dimensional space time Yeah, the the mechanism by which Those those those dimension those hidden dimensions are become hidden the shape of that space as it were Uh, it seems to have many many choices um, and even amongst the choices that end up resembling to a sort of first First pass our world Um, there are many many choices within that From a pragmatic perspective that ends up looking like you have a theory with a lot of Unexplained parameters right and and so that that's that's one of the things we're still struggling with in string theory Is that really true or have we not understood very well enough to to see how to fix those parameters and the answer is we don't know Yeah, it's very hard to do experiments right you're talking about energy scales far beyond what we can probe at the large adron collider for example Yeah, yeah, the the the will be nice if there was experimental guidance to help us fix those parameters and and it could be You know, and the pessimistic view is that those parameters aren't fixed and you do some experiment to to to figure out what those parameters are and you know, there's just Any number of different ways of of designing a string theory to fit those parameters and see you lose predictive ability and You know that's a big discussion. Yeah, I mean there as I recall there was a hope back in the 80s. I know that The theory came online in the 60s and it was developed But only by a small number of people in the 70s and it exploded in popularity in the 80s. Yeah And there was hope that it would be unique right like the string theory would just predict the ratio of masses of all these different particles And so as of 2018 that seems to be unlikely right? Is that fair? It seems to be It's seem it what's the best way of putting it I wouldn't say it hasn't come true yet and well unlikely says something more than it hasn't come true yet It's talking about you know whether or not it will come true the answer is we don't know But so the question is what are the prospects for the theory is is it that there's some mechanism that will teach us that there's a unique Answer that string theory will will produce and I think no one has All feels that we're necessarily close to a good idea that will tell us if there's some big principle we're missing But clearly from the way you're phrasing this you're still holding out the prospect. I think it's a possibility that that old idea Good work in some shape or form My gut feeling says that it where by time we figure out Something like that we may not even be doing something that that's even recognisably string theory anymore Right so what we'll get to that but first we skipped over the whole 10 dimensional. Yeah, you said 26. I said 26 trying green tells me it's 10 Yes, you guys disagreeing oh no no It's not it's not this new math at all. There really is a 16 to be understood Again depending upon how you think about it There are there are there are different ways of going from that 26 to 10 but the short version of the story is is that the theory That's 26 dimension was really the first thing you write down and you you basically in in nature in particle physics There are two broad kinds of particle The things called fermion things called bosons It has to do with what's called the spin of these particles and but roughly speaking The stuff most everything that you think of as a matter particle is actually a fermion It has what's called spin half or some fractional spin sorry some multiple of Half spin yes, yeah, thank you So electron You just realized that your business needed to hire someone yesterday How can you find amazing candidates fast easy just use indeed because when it comes to hiring indeed is all you need Indeed's sponsored jobs will help you stand out and hire fast with sponsored jobs Your post jumps to the top of the page for your relevant candidates So you can reach the people you want faster and it makes a huge difference According to indeed data Sponsored jobs posted directly on indeed have 45 percent more applications than non-sponsored jobs There's no need to wait any longer speed up your hiring right now with indeed and listeners of minescape will get a $75 sponsor job credit to get your jobs more visibility at indeed.com slash minescape Just go to indeed.com slash minescape right now and support our show by saying you heard about indeed on this podcast Indeed.com slash minescape terms and conditions apply hiring indeed is all you need so so Yes Electrons Quarks and things like that Whereas the particles they exchange that Giverized to force that we recognize as force exchange particles are actually bosons right so The original string theories that were written down that are 26-dimensional Are our bosonic string theories they just have that one kind but nature has these two kinds So if you start trying to write down theories that have both kinds of particles fermions and bosons as an attempt to understand nature What you find is that the theory Again doesn't work very well unless You work in 10 dimensions. So the 26-dimensional theory has forces but not matter if you like yes, and if we want both Ten dimensions seems to be the way to go. Yeah, and so and that was that was what triggered the big explosion what's called the first super string revolution Which was so John Schwartz and Michael Green Found that the the things that were Were failing to work when you had both bosons and fermions in the theory um Go away precisely in 10 dimensions They they that there's a there's a big Internal consistency thing called an anomaly Which you need which comes up in quantum theories when you have fermions and those go away precisely in those dimensions for very very beautiful and uh Interesting from a technical perspective reasons which meant that people really began to pay attention because it was it was it was a consistency that um Was so so delicate and and and and and so intricately put together it told you something very deep Was going on so in some sense it's again the theory is telling you what his demands are Like there wasn't it wasn't even obvious that it would work in any number of domains And this is where the word super yeah attached to superstring right right and that's because um uh the the presence of fermions and bosons Actually have to come in a certain kind of balance it turns out there's a symmetry relating the bosons and fermions which got called super symmetry and That was a that was a kind of symmetry that had not been thought of before that actually was discovered in the context of uh of string theory um and uh and turns out to be again in its own right very interesting and we can probably talk about that too so super symmetry Was combined with string theory and so the term super string theory was born Some of the some of the the real sort of big shots in the field started paying attention then and started making some remarkable contributions so famously with that's when wind came into the field headwitten and um and started showing How you these internal spaces where this hidden six dimensions because six plus fours ten Those hidden six dimensions would be had had certain important properties that he was able to characterize and and uh and then it turned out to lead to an explosion of activity in mathematics as well because those spaces turn out to have very important mathematical properties This is this is actually the birth of string theory as this this other thing Which is a unifier of ideas in in theoretical physics and mathematics and and some other fields um because it turns out that the that those tight consistencies begin to generate new Knowledge about the mathematical possibilities that you can have and then yet another thing that the theory ended up telling us that we didn't put into it Is that string theory is not just a theory of strength. Yeah. There's other stuff Why couldn't we just stop with the string exactly and and so historically that's really interesting because People were asking that question very early on well if you go from points to lines Why stop there? Yeah, and people and people were coming up with all kinds of reasons Why you should stop there which were not very well-motivated but mostly due to you know failure of imagination and no good evidence that the other stuff would work I remember in the early 90s being in a lecture hall at a summer school and a student asked Well, why aren't there two dimensional membranes and a extremely famous string theory the two's name I will suppress was extremely scoffing of the idea that we should go anywhere beyond strength. Yeah I remember being in some of those rooms and hearing some of those answers and questions as well and What actually happened is the the the the theory began to cry out for the inclusion of those sorts of things itself So there were hints There were hints by a number of people working, but I think some of them as compelling hints were done in this beautiful paper by by Paul Townsend and Chris Hull and and then Edward Witten very famously actually at a conference that was here at USC where I'm based in 1995 Put it all together and triggered what we now call the second super string revolution the idea was that if you start Considering regimes, which are if you like called strongly interacting regimes where the strings are not just interacting with each other weekly um But uh really really strongly uh you you you start going into getting into difficulties. This actually this actually happens more broadly than just in in string theory or particle physical What have you typically anything we calculate in theoretical physics Is in a regime um Usually starts out in a regime with a skull perturbation theory where you start out with the theory where nothing is interacting And then you add in the particle to go and raid by Yeah, it's never bumping. Yeah, indeed. That's easy. We can do that. Yeah, and so you get that all right And then you go okay now. Let's get these guys to interact, but we do it First very weekly we say that it's it's the non-interacting theory plus some small corrections the interaction tiny glancing blows Yeah, and actually that turns out to be incredibly powerful much of theoretical physics is based on just doing that But there are regimes again you driven you often driven to them by The necessity to understand experiments and things like that where you actually need to understand regimes where those constituents are interacting with each other strongly and If you ask that question about string theory You you you you find that a lot of the descriptions that you first thought of in terms of strings interacting with each other are not very good descriptions at all And they begin to break down in a way that leaves you wondering what to do and and so one possibility is that eventually you just find sure We're lucky maybe in some regime and we find a strong couple description and and then you work out the answers and you're done what actually happened in this case is that We started understanding it first in these extremes where Uh if you if you try and understand strong coupling but sort of at some intermediate level the whole theory looks like a mess the basic the basic players begin to You it's hard to tell who's what you lose track of who the basic players are the basic degrees of freedom as we would say technically It's not clear what they are anymore But if you if you just in your mind extrapolate to to an extremely strongly coupled regime The theory begins to simplify again strangely And it turns out that there's a way of rewriting all of that horrible mess In terms of a weekly coupled theory again which sounds bizarre Um, but it says that what you can I did what you can do is identify new players in this in this in this horrible Mathematical mess that if you describe things from their perspective um, the theory simplifies again So it's like if two people have never met they are just individuals and we treat them that way If they are long fallen in love and are married then there are a couple let me treat them that way But it's when they know each other a little bit and there's sexual tension that things are complicated and we're not quite sure how to treat them right But if you go to the other extreme and I'm trying to see where this analogy is going to go The very couple is strongly coupled Yes, but I'm wondering what the uh what the what the dual wiki Limit weekly couple or Messing-phropic people who don't like having But indeed yes, it's hard to sort of pull these things apart the you know the the the the whole is greater than some of its parts But finishing the story what we found is um and and this is this is something that It's sort of where I came in in terms of that stage in my career where I was very interested in strongly coupled problems um the You find in some of these regimes that the new players sometimes are strings again um, but in some cases they're not strings. They're actually Extended objects higher-dimensional membranes. So they either have they're either like a sheet of paper Which is a two-dimensional membrane or Higher dimensions and because you have ten dimensions You you have many many different possibilities and it turns out when you when you sit down and work it all out Basically all the possibilities are in play the full description of string theory is not As a theory of strings at all. It's a it's a it's a theory of all different all possibilities of extended objects Interacting in some way just so happens that strings Are privileged by being the things that carry Because of that that closed loop that carry the quantum of gravity um, but uh there's more than just gravity going on right And this this relationship between Weekly coupled strings and strongly coupled other things that maybe strings or other things Um, this is an example of a duality. Yeah, so uh that the phrase duality is used all over our culture Of course in in this context You know, it has some of that same character which is that they were there were there are two or more aspects to this ways of looking at this This this whole thing and so duality in this case is saying there's some physics and In one way of looking at it it can be described in terms of interacting strings But there's a different way of looking at it in which uh, it may be interacting membranes or an interacting set of strings that are very different from the other perspective and and so these dual natures um are Considered both essential to understanding what the whole thing is so it's one theory that we can talk about in two different ways Yes, yes You know in some ways well actually I would say it differently. I would say it's it's it's one set of phenomena um and we have Different theories that describe parts of those phenomena That sort of fit together in a patchwork to give us an understanding of the whole thing is it sometimes I say tell me if I've been making mistake here Sometimes I say it's that we have two different classical limits of the same underlying quantum theory um I mean that's not I'm not 100% happy with that but um I mean you're still sure sure yeah, okay, I mean you know it's fine I mean there can be other there can be other limits that are sort of intrinsically quantum Yeah, this is good enough. Yeah, enough for podcasts. Yeah, I think Yeah, there's another dual podcast in which I just the dual podcast is much more strongly coupled than this one is And this is all part of this whole business with the brain BRANES Yes, that's constructed from membranes. Yeah, we have one brains are just strings Two brains three brains four brains five brains etc And this all came in the 1990s. So the early 80s were the first super string revolution The 1990s were the second super string revolution And the most famous duality of the more came on the scene in the 1990s thanks to one more designer Yes, so with uh within with a so 1995 was the was the was the revolution where we realized that brains were were crucial and lots of the many different string theories the five well the four different string theories that we did That we did know about were actually parts of this big hole and people were banding about this term that whole thing should be called M theory, but no one knew what M stood for and every possible pun on the word brain They're getting a paper title. Exactly. Yeah, you're responsible for some of those and But then And I will get I will get to to to Mal the center in a moment, but it's it's worth mentioning that the really key thing I would say uh that stopped this from all being Just nice words Was that um people began to find these very very uh sharp computational tools that allowed you to really Handle because previously we didn't have the technical ability to handle the dynamics of these higher dimensional objects, which is I think why a lot of people said well they just don't make sense because The previous attempts just meant meant that it wasn't working and uh So famously Joe Polchinski Uh sadly passed away this year um Was responsible for coming up with the technology The calculational technology that told told you at least in some regimes how to handle these Different kinds of higher dimensional extended objects right and describe their shapes how they intersect It was just an amazingly powerful um technology um and By the way just yeah because I know we use the word but this is a different Yes of the word technology than some of our listeners might be familiar Technical know how and ability so not a not a not a device in terms of a physical device But a it means by which you can calculate things right um and get answers which is the the meat and drink of uh all the tofu of uh of um of uh of Of the theorist and and so this calculational technology then began to be applied to many different things whether you were interested in Uh better models of How to get the standard model particle physics out one heavy but also uh Understanding questions about black holes real quantum gravity questions and uh so there's a whole story there But this amazingly is happening in two years yeah from 1995 Um by 1997 we have a very nice detailed picture uh of of of uh of uh of how to do a lot of things with black holes and string theory There's a seminal paper in 96 by strawminger and vaffa um and then there's a host of other papers um and what was beginning to emerge was this idea that there are There's another kind of duality called um uh Okay, well for technical reasons called gauge gravity duality Which is that there are calculations you could do using gravity that will teach you things about what are called gauge theories gauge theories are certain kinds of particle physics type theories that you use in particle physics to calculate things that they don't have gravity in them Did you know fast growing trees is the biggest online nursery in the US with thousands of different plants and over two million happy customers They have all the plants your yard needs like fruit trees privacy trees flowering trees shrubs and so much more Whatever plants you're interested in fast growing trees has you covered find the perfect fit for your climate and space fast growing trees makes it easy to get your dream yard order online and get your plants delivered directly to your door in just a few days without ever leaving home They're alive and thrive guarantee ensures your plants arrive happy and healthy This spring they have the best deals for your yard up to half off on select plants and other deals and listeners to our show get 15% off their first purchase While using the code minescape at checkout That's an additional 15% off at fastgrowingtrees.com using the code minescape at checkout fastgrowingtrees.com code Minescape now's the perfect time to plant use minescape to save today offers valve for limited time terms and conditions may apply Yeah, that's the important thing. So this is exact when we say gauge theory We're not going to define what a gauge theory is But it's a certain kind of theory that just lives in the world where you ignore gravity We still particles interacting with each other so the standard meat and potatoes as you just said of a particle physicist prototype example of that is the theory of electromagnetism that is the that is the the original and arguably the best gauge theory And you know going back to you know maxholes description of electromagnetism in the in the 19th century So you have you have this this this powerful tool that we know works really well for particle physics It is still the thing we use to get the answers right about what's coming out of the large hydro and collider and one heavy these are gauge series So all the Feynman diagrams the whole is yeah Feynman diagrams all those things come from from from working on gauge series So gauge series Turn out to be a key piece of the tool that describes these these extended objects these brains of different kinds called D brain That Joe had found with collaborators Anyway, so The one what was beginning to emerge when you started applying them to Things like black holes etc. Was that there are calculations you can do just using theories with no gravity these gauge series and they will tell you about things That have to do with gravity and and that was Unpressive that was really unprecedented if you follow how string theory is built it follows from some of those very early things I was telling you about those close loops coming from the Joining of Open loops and just to think we had to catch our breath here This is a lot to take in but so we were starting with gauge theories Which is just a fancy way of saying we're doing particle physics without gravity Okay, which means because you said before that string theory predicts gravity these aren't even string theories These are just particle physics theories right yeah And we look at them closely enough in the right circumstances And we realize they're secretly telling us something about gravity even though gravity wasn't there Yes mind blowing it is mind blowing and and but it is all traceable back to the fact that when you embed These things called gauge series when you embed them in string theory Which is to say when you Because string theory contains All a lot of stuff as I said Coming from the vibrations of these different kinds of strings and what have you and so there's some kinds of string that When when when you describe their vibrations And you again you look at them sort of Far away enough that you don't realize that their loops of string they just look like little particles They will give you gauge series and those are really the things the things are referred to earlier as open strings the strings that have end right and uh so But because string theories uh Tell you that Sorry because the dynamics of you know, just the the laws of motion of these things tell you that they have to close up Eventually They will tell you if you'd even if you don't put it in that they also know about Gravity right and and so it comes out of the theory at you again That was not something we weren't looking for it came out of the theory and so so people were beginning to Understand how to handle that on a technical level better and better And so the idea of these dualities different pictures you could use where sometimes I'm studying the physics in terms of gravitational physics Well sometimes I'm discovering I'm studying it in terms of non gravitational physics And I can get Sometimes useful answers from both perspectives that was beginning to emerge and then and by late 1997 An example a very very clean and beautiful example of this was put forward by by Juan Maldicina Which is called now called the ADSCFT correspondence and that is just a version But a very very powerful and sharp version of this larger picture of this duality between gravity and gay sherry and so the ADSCFT correspondence and the ADS and the CFT are technical terms Which really telling you that I do gravity in a certain kind of Of of space or space time which is actually called anti-dissiter It basically it's a it's a space time that is It has a cosmological constant It has an energy density to the space time that turns out to be negative And you can write it down and and do things with it. It's a model It doesn't have necessarily anything to do with our world It's it's a it's a place in which you can do Certain kinds of quantum gravity calculations and that that's always a healthy thing to be able to do But when you do those calculations Including sometimes the you know the pret that black holes are present. They may form. They may disappear All the sorts of things they can do. There's a completely different description of that With in a theory that has no gravity in one dimension fewer and that's an important clue I think that we ought to get back to in one dimension fewer Which just looks like a somewhat difficult but but in principle possible particle physics calculation and so This gives you this amazing Insight into what gravity may or may not be but it also gives you this amazing toolbox Because one of the things that comes along with these dualities is that it tells you that sometimes the easy calculations on one side Of the duality turn out to be the hard calculation on the other side So for pragmatic reasons we like dualities because usually they tell us they give us ways of calculating things that we normally can't get at So so there's a piece of physics you're trying to describe which is a really hard particle physics Computation and it tells you do this gravity computation and you'll get the answer or there's a really hard gravity Computation and it says do this particle physics calculation you get the answer this amazingly gives you insight into A whole bunch of interesting problems that were sort of held up for decades So let's see if we can't make sure we understand what ADS means anti-decentral space so Tell us a little about remind us this sense in which it's not the real world We live in the real world and the real world seems to have a positive energy in empty space a positive cosmological constant indeed and so The cosmological constant what the different ways of thinking about one way to thinking about is that there's just Intrinsic It just comes with the territory amount of energy associated where if you take a chunk of space time and you were to look at its energy content You would find that it has some and their three possibilities it can either be positive negative Or zero even in empty space even in empty space space itself has this as this energy density associated with it and So for a long time we thought that it was zero For for for for our world and we didn't notice any right? We didn't notice any in theorists being theorists then wrote many many papers saying well of course it's a row here's my theory You might have must be sure exactly and and The So the object you know so there've been observations that suggest at least among the simplest explanations is that our universe actually has a small Uh Positive cosmological constant You can also write the universe apart Indeed it's one way of thinking about it is that it really sort of accelerates expansion of the universe The negative cosmological constant is is the other possibility um and uh So like I said it doesn't necessarily seem to have anything to do with our universe but Because of this duality I was telling you about it tells you about how to do calculate because calculations in such negative Uh cosmological constant spaces secretly are calculating for you um Strongly coupled particle physics question, right Um, there are ways in which people have been using that forgetting about the whole whether or not This is anything to do with theories of everything or anything like that It's just an issue of I now have this toolbox that tells me how to do these strongly coupled calculations Which are really important for understanding things in nuclear physics Uh really important things for understanding things in condensed metaphysics there are there are there are phases of particle physics whether it's a lots of electrons interacting with each other and in a certain kind of medium Or whether it's the core of a neutron star or whether it's um Just the nuclei of uh of of of of our atoms um those actually are intrinsically strongly coupled systems that nature Tells us are there and we can experiment on them and they have phenomena that we don't understand in terms of doing weekly coupled calculations So you need a tool that can tell you how to do some of these strongly coupled calculations and um Uh There are many different kinds of tools but among the tools are now Thinking about them in terms of these dual theories of gravity right so I'm still not completely convinced that Uh, uh, we all know what ADS is so I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep counting on this sorry. Uh, it's fine. So uh ADS is we say it's a space time with a negative cosmological constant So it's not like a place you can go. It's not like you know a location in our universe This is a hypothetical universe right that we physicists can write down the equations for and it's basically in empty universe Except that there's a negative energy in empty space itself. That's what that's what anti-disorder space is. Yes, right? Yes, there's a person named a sitter Yes a hundred years ago and he invented a sitter space and now we just changed the sign Change the sign and a whole lot of things change when you change that simple sign exactly. Yeah, and it's uh This might even be dangerous to say but maybe it's better to bring up the confusions and fix them to pretend that they're not there If a positive cosmological constant accelerates things apart Uh, why wouldn't a negative cosmological constant just cause the universe to recalapse into a big crunch? Oh, that's a good question. I have to think about Think about a good way of thinking about that. Uh, I mean the short answer is that it does if there's other stuff Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to think I'm trying to think it sort of famously um when you start adding Uh, when you start adding things you will get instabilities right. I'm trying to think in some ways why the pure case is still Quite robust. I mean, it's kind of nothing to cross. Yeah, I guess there's nothing to crunch. Yeah, that's a guy That's that's a good way of putting it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so we have an infinitely big space Yeah, negative energy everywhere and you're saying that a theory of gravity of quantum grip Mm-hmm In that space is dual two which is done the way of saying is sort of physically the same But in written in a different way as a theory with no gravity at all in one less dimension So if we had a four-dimensional anti-disorder space That will be dual to a three-dimensional quantum field theory. Yeah, and Problems that are hard in one theory might be easy in the other one advice first And now we have this way of taking hard problems and mapping them on to easy problems So this is full employment for theoretical physicists. Yeah, I mean ultimately that's really all we do We we find tools for answering You know doing cow you know being able to calculate in various regimes and understand things and Much of the rest is you know decoration So the word holography also So I was gonna get to that because one of one of the things It Also tells us is that worrying about the dimension of space time itself Uh Maybe a red herring I personally think it's this is all a clue that You know when we start going oh string theory has this a number of dimensions and you hit a bunch of them won't have it I think one day will understand that that's all the red herring. It's overrated. It's based times overrated Well dimension itself is is is is something that is Going to be somewhat in the eye of the beholder and we already see it in this in this context you do um These calculations in in one of these gay series so you start out for example trying to understand certain phenomena in Three plus one dimensional space time you think surely that's the right way because we live in three plus one dimensions And you do the calculation and it goes off to strong coupling and you have good experimental reason to want to know what the Anzazar and strong coupling and then someone comes along and says well for that particular phenomenon Here is a way of understanding it, but you've got to work with a five-dimensional theory of gravity And now with anyone ordered right and and you know you might go well That's just nonsense or you might go I just want something that can tell me what the answers are and and uh and so you just hold Your nose if the wrong number of dimensions and it's the theory of gravity which isn't where I started But from a pragmatic perspective that's telling you that you can get answers to physical phenomena Nature doesn't care whether you label it with this number of dimensions and whether this is gravity or not and nature's just nature I think that's where we're being led. Yeah And that we saw that also with the is it particles is it strings is it membranes is what have you nature doesn't care And this is part of why and I think this is the single hardest thing for people in the public to get as to why String theorists are so excited. I mean there's been an anti-string theory backlash. There was a pro string theory, you know Councilman four last You know the elegant universe came along people were very very excited Nova special etc and then they there was these books against it and people got upset But when you're in the trenches doing string theory this theory that you wrote down in the 1960s Keeps pushing us in interesting directions that we didn't even anticipate it It smells like something right is going on and maybe that's Maybe it's not right, you know, it's always possible because at the end of the day It's going to be experiments that decide but there are really good reasons to think that it's not just all an accident that all this is working out Yeah, not on this it's not an accident. It's not that we're being misled by you know a A vocal set of senior people what have you because the point is is that This is this is theoretical physics so you can do those calculations and the calculations themselves are telling you what's going on some some you know some visionary senior people may tell you to look at those calculations But then very rapidly you get up to speed and you see oh this really is interesting and then for your own reasons Depending upon your own flavor of a physics that that led you to where you are you go Oh, there's something really interesting in here And and there's more than meets the eye and and so I think historically This is an interesting time because I think we really are sort of chipping away at corners of something that I think is much larger much more interesting and None of us know where it's going to go and yes But it is certainly the case that it could turn out all to be wrong But I suspect even if it turns out to be wrong in the sense of it isn't good for the thing that we thought it was going to be good for I'd be surprised if it wasn't going to be good for something Well, you made the point that it's we developed technology in this sense and it's It can now be applied to problems that are other than the big bang or quantum gravity right and so give us just give us just one example First to fix our minds either from your work or from somewhere else about how we can use Let's say ADSCFT this duality between particle physics and gravity to do to answer some tangible questions about physics Yeah, well, so there are a number of regions where I think a lot of the work is is You know just that one step further than then then maybe you're sort of qualitative in the sense that there are kinds of behavior that you would like to Um Classify you'd like to understand at least what the possibilities are that you see in strongly coupled systems are in real experiments so people actually make You know their condensed matter people people who worry about clumps of Material that where the electrons are doing stuff in some strange way and there's some new kind of way they behave as a result of them interacting strongly You'd like to understand but we're talking about real people in real life. There's a lot five-dimensional Yeah, these are real people in real lab building stuff that maybe in your phone one day right or or something like that And then on the other hand, there are questions to do with the kinds of things that can happen when you take lots of nuclear material Quarks interacting strongly and clump them together now one example is just nuclei themselves the nuclei of atoms But you also have nuclear material doing interesting things in astrophysics You get entire You know 10 miles across Lumps of nuclear material condensed together called neutron stars that we now actually observe them colliding Yeah in real positionally And that may be the place where a huge amount of the heavy elements You know gold famously and what have you actually that that we see here on earth actually came from All of those have to do with phases are strongly coupled matter That that we know take place in in nature and we don't have good descriptions of so there many many different kinds of possibilities and of the the working with These dual theories At least help you enumerate the kinds of possibilities They don't get the answers right on the nose because these systems are typically very complicated and Have many more components and we can handle computationally But there are there are broad Brush strokes you want to get right Initially like a what is even possible what kinds of phases um of these different kinds of matter Exotic matter if you like can you get and previously we had no good tools for enumerating those phases very nicely That's one thing that you do get out of these Out of these These kinds are strongly coupled models so didn't I see that you wrote a paper with neutron stores in the titles um Have I written a paper with neutron stars? I mean I have been thinking about neutron stars. I plan to write some papers on your But this is the kind of thing but literally using the tools we learned from string theory to understand the neutron stars out there Yeah, yeah, so so some of my earliest work was Very early on when this ADSCFT stuff came out um I I figured out ways with with some colleagues of of working out You know what the physicists would call the phase diagram which is essentially a diagram of the possibilities the kinds of phases so famously phases Water It has a solid form. It has a liquid form. It has a gaseous form You can actually work out the phase diagram of water under under various pray, you know This pressure and this temperature what form is it in so you can work that out you need to know that to understand water If you really claim to understand water so you need to understand that for nuclear physics as well So so some of the sort of the very early work Was the stuff I was involved with in showing that this in principle could help you get the the phase diagram of the core of a neutron star right in principle You know this was again broad brush strokes Because I was I was convinced that that would be Uh a really great application for some of this stuff now as I said this is broad brush strokes is a lot to be done What's been happening really very recently which I think is is very exciting is the whole business of being able to calculate very difficult quantum mechanical Sorry, yeah quantum mechanical diagnostic tools as it were in in field theories again our colleagues in um The experimental world of various kinds want to know when these different phases are are happening or about to happen or about to be changed from one phase to another What do you keep track of to figure out what what you know what's going on? How do you characterize these things a lot of these Trudy a lot of the traditional phases of matter I typically would be go that we learn about in school and what have you have to do with things being driven by very classical sorts of things that are going on now a lot of these new phases are driven by quantum effects, so it's harder it's harder and it's harder to calculate yeah And so there are very important quantities called entanglement that are the things that we like to keep track We think it would be good to keep track of turns out these are really hard things to calculate in in in field theories outside two dimensional field theories where it turns out their tricks you can use um one of the really big things that's been happening in the last um Just a few years I would say um has been the explosion of methods using gravity duels Of calculating These quantum diagnostic things what things like entanglement entropy and various cousins of entanglement entropy And you use these now as as the things you track to see when the degrees of freedom are rearranging themselves in a new phase Is coming up um that's going to be hugely important um I think in as an application on the quantum side But then uh we've also been turning it on its head Because I think people are beginning to realize that keeping track of quantum degrees of freedom maybe a a a more Maybe arguably fundamental way of keeping track of what's going on on the spacetime side what what's what's what's gravity actually doing right? And and so um It's becoming also important in understanding what truly are black holes in string theory um What and and hopefully what truly black holes are quantum mechanically and fuzz balls are in the news the black holes might be fuzzy balls of string Yeah, so so this is again something is hugely important um I think uh the going back to 1996 Uh where we embedded black holes in string theory Uh Now with the new knowledge that strings is more than strings. It's all of these other kinds of things And we realized that we could understand a number of the fundamental things that beckonstein and hawking had said about black holes And quantum mechanics back in the 70s. We understood how to actually prove some of those things they said in uh in 1996 and that was started with strawmanger and vat as beautiful paper um And then what happens is that we sort of forgot some of the lessons that we learned from that paper and and some of the follow-up papers and and and and then we started revisiting black holes and quantum mechanics again and water black holes quantum information paradox and uh and samir mahthor pointed out that actually if we go back to that original picture of strawmanger and vat and and just follow What the string theory tells you It tells you something quite remarkable Which is that all of that stuff you use to build the black holes out of these strings interacting with membranes Won't have you if you follow what those things do um it tells you that black holes Really in some sense are themselves emergent phenomena. They're not really real They are the result of uh of taking the classical limit and going to general relativity in some sense and the full quantum phenomena are real Yeah Yes, I tried to shy away from the word um fundamental in the little you at 59 minutes using the word yeah um and so so that's all sounds a bit woolly but the pragmatic result is that um Again in a way it's maybe again a kind of a duality if you're interested in astrophysical problems that are far away from the business of quantum effects sure use Einstein's general relativity and that solution that shwoshield taught us Is the black hole with a horizon and that'll that'll do a good job um if you're interested in Understand the internal structure of the black hole from a quantum mechanical perspective Um, that's not good enough yet And what and what this picture coming from string theory tells you is that you build black holes out of these uh these uh fuzzy kinds of domains that that you can actually describe in string theory that they're in in a way the stringiness makes it all very fuzzy And when you put lots of them together and sort of squint a little bit It effectively looks like the thing you call a black hole with with a sharp horizon But if you if you if you if you if you look closely enough you'll see that actually there is no horizon the horizon just to this effective thing That describes the collective Phonomena coming from all of those things interacting together and and in some ways it Immediately tells you that the black hole information paradox isn't a paradox at all right It's just a paradox that is forced upon you by taking that approximation of pretending there's a horizon Effectively where there really isn't so speaking of the real world we're in it uh and your professor and if you go teach a class So um, I really wanted to talk about the fact that you wrote a graphic novel. I have a little more time Are you ever more no more? I'm not I'm not too far away and uh and uh if you have students don't start turning up for at least another few minutes off the class So you know how much time you have so uh I'll mention it in the in the intro but tell us a little bit Because it it comes out of your desire to everyone be enthusiastic about physics and string theory But you wrote a graphic novel and you illustrated it. Yeah, and you know in some ways um the the the the the illustrated and graphic part of it um Wasn't the driving force so much as as my my frustration with the fact that um uh You know the kind of books we we we write You know as sort of professional theorists who want to tell you exciting things about what we're doing um Uh aren't always um aren't always inviting you to be part of the conversation And what I really wanted to do was was was have something that was more conversational and in some ways That it didn't see they didn't I don't want it to just be the voice of the expert telling you what to think about start And there's nothing wrong with that kind of book you've written so far I'll probably write some I'm gonna talk and you're gonna listen And uh do not read the comments and uh and so um and so i wanted to Revisit in some ways i realized that it would be fun to revisit this ancient form which is the dialogue form Yeah, where you actually uh as a reader you end up eavesdropping on a conversation between people about ideas and in some sense that gives you multiple voices and Different points of view and it helps you unpack The the concepts in a way that i i i i think is not done as much as i think would be nice in sort of contemporary Writing so that was the idea and then i've long had the ambition of writing a book in dialogue form My publisher does not want me to do it. I think i'm working on it It would not be illustrated, but you pulled it off so i'm jealous well, you know Thank you and yes a lot of publishers In fact most of them just didn't get it right they didn't get what i was trying to do they they uh and uh and uh And then worse it had all these pictures because then i thought because i was thinking actually would be really great Would be to see that these conversations aren't you know When we do think of the dialogues going back to these The ancients we think of people in togas on mountain tops having deep conversations about philosophy And i want us to go well you can have conversations Um but they're taking place in the contemporary world you know In cafes and museums and on buses and trains where we all are right and and sciences and just taking place in in labs and Conference rooms and what have you and then the other thing was it would be ordinary people And it would be great if you could see these people in these places So that was the whole package and i thought oh clearly this would be Narrative art would be a graphic novel style book and are they talking about string theory and so they do that string theory is in there You know it isn't a book about string theory. It is one of many things that That people talk about in these conversations the other great thing about conversations is that conversations don't have a signpost telling you what it's about right So one of the great things about science is that it's interconnected right and you start talking about one thing and you end up in this other place And it's all been interesting i mean hopefully Yes Jack it can't be claimed and and and and so that messiness of conversation i also thought would be fun to have um and then the final thing and i Because i'm sort of babbling um is is the fact that i think these conversations really do happen I i'm a big people watcher i sit in cafes and i'm listening to people and science does come up and you hear people You know neither of them are experts but they they want to engage with the stuff they saw a tv show or they read a book and they want to talk more about these ideas And so in One of the things that's frustrating is that no one celebrates that these conversations are taking place So i wanted the book that really celebrates the spirit of those conversations invites people to have their own And gives you a snapshot of some of those conversations Through through You know thumbing through and seeing what's going on. So that was the idea and yeah, it seemed to like it They do have they do happen these conversations and they don't happen enough and we can encourage them a little bit more And so it's called the dialogues yes dialogues Subtitle conversations about the nature of the universe available wherever books are available Where the books are available and uh, you know You'll find some bookstores where it's in the science section and some bookstores where it's in the graphic novel section Just ask for it just ask and and and if they don't have it tell them to order a bunch because other people will find them and Usually really really love it once they once they find it all right clever jones. Thanks so much for being on the button It's a real pleasure
