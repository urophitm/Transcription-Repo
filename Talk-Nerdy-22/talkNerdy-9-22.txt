Hello everyone and welcome to talk nerdy today is Monday December 2nd 2019 I'm the host of the show Cara Santa Maria. I'm actually time traveling a little bit because although I'm recording this in my studio in Los Angeles I am currently in it looks like I've just landed in Melbourne Australia from Christ church Where I'm doing a little tour with the skeptics guide to the universe at the skeptic conventions there in that part of the world So if I just saw you in Christ church that was fun. I think even though it hasn't happened yet All right, I'm really excited about this week's show we get to talk to you doctor Robert crease But before I dive into all that I want to thank those of you who have made talk nerdy possible remember talk nerdy Is and will always be a hundred percent free to download and that's because of support from listeners just like you those of you who have gone to patreon.com slash talk nerdy and pledged your support I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart I want to also just give a shout out to the top supporters this week And they include Sinai Ulrika Hagman Pedro Em Rosario Barbosa Dutas Infinitas Filty Bear the zombie drummer David J. Eastmith Brian Holden and Jeffrey Siul All right guys, so let's talk about this week's show. It is oh my gosh. It's such a good one. It's everything. I love so This week I get to talk to dr. Robert Creece He's the chair of the philosophy Philosophy Department at Stony Brook University He has a brand new book out called The Workshop and the World what 10 thinkers can teach us about science and Authority so this book is all about kind of the public's relationship with the idea of authority and Science denial. This is about what we can learn from the past from experiences of past thinkers and the social context in which they existed and You know how that is telling us a lot about what's going on in our society right now So it's a really really good one guys. I can't I can't say better things about it So I think probably the best thing to do is I don't know just listen I guess without any further ado here he is dr. Robert Creece Well Robert, thank you so much for joining me today Thank you for inviting me Cara Absolutely, so I've been really looking forward to chatting about your newest to book At this point it did come out a few months ago now, right Because we're recording this in November Yes, it came out in March Yeah, yeah, and it's been sitting on my shelf and I've been I've been periodically Looking at the individual stories of the different chapters in the book. It's such a timely and important topic that you Die into really deftly, but you do it through a survey of history, which I think is really really important You know that kind of classic Saying that history is going to repeat itself and we must we must learn from history But it's something that we very I think rarely want to do or want to have to do so Do you think that it would be safe for me to say that The main theme if we had to pick one of this book is Is kind of a warning against science denial Sure, I mean it's it's an exploration of the authority of science how much authority should science have Where how do you gain it? How do you lose it and if you lose it how to regain it again? But as you said, I I'd like to go back to the beginning that is you know nowadays we We need Science input into governmental policy and decisions more than ever the key existential questions facing the planet are all requires scientific input the Global warming being one pollution being another And what I thought I do and yet we have politicians who who make a point out of denying the importance the authority of Science in fact they even it's somehow appealing to voters. It's a it's a mark of anti-illitism to To reject the authority of science. So what I thought I'd do And you put it really well is to go back to the beginning that is in the first In the first few decades when the modern science began There were people like bacon and and galley on day card who argued for that science has should have authority and This was when no science yet existed there were no cell phones no automobiles no higgs bosons And so they had argued to the people around them the politicians around them and the political leaders around them that Science had authority and the science was a source of authority Worth in fact essentially essential to listen to But they met resistance they met the first science deniers and they had a cope with that resistance So what I thought to do for the book is to go back and look at the experiences of these first The these first people argued for the authority of science see how they did it see what kind of resistance What kind of denial they encountered and see how they They cope with that denial and I hope to find clues for what to do today from their stories I mean, I think that that's so important because so often we think of Sort of the modern era as something that is much more advanced much more sophisticated almost as if we're a different species as if we've evolved to beyond the cognitive biases and the geopolitical and kind of tribalistic issues That may have existed hundreds of years ago But ultimately you're really seeing kind of the same theme recapitulating You know just because we now have as you put a modern science like it is an institution We have a lot of publications. We have consensus on several topics That doesn't mean that everybody knows how to think scientifically or even respects the scientific method The way that maybe people who have studied might or people who have taken the time or even have had the opportunity in the privilege To think about these things philosophically have you right we think of ourselves as different But in a way we're in a very similar situation that is it's it's a question of of trusting people Who know more than we do I mean the basic question is authority and authority means Someone has authority if they if they're able to get people to defer to them with comfort in situations Where the people are vulnerable? So you know modern societies run by experts when do we defer to experts and that's not necessarily a when should we defer to experts and that's not That's not a scientific issue. That's the question of who you trust and and and how How much you need the advice and how seriously you take the advice which is interesting because there's almost a Sheen or a facade to science that somehow it doesn't require That kind of bowing to authority that there's something a little bit more populist or egalitarian About it that that the whole point of the scientific method is that like I can observe with my own eyes and I can Find confirming or disconfirming evidence like that science is not about the monarchy It's about the people yet of course not everybody's going to dedicate their lives to the type of study that Required that's required in order to understand sophisticated science. Oh, absolutely. I mean the solution to science denial is not to make everyone scientists Um, the um veteran owned and operated the bearded Viking meat crews reinventing the ancient art of meat making with a modern twist They're award-winning needs are handcrafted with high quality ingredients offering a rich variety of flavors that range from bold and fruity to smooth and traditional Whether you're sitting there classic OG or enjoying creative blends like choke cherry vanilla or jalapeno raspberry There's something for every palate with a commitment to quality and flavor the bearded Viking meat company focuses on creating good times for a great Meetup to bring family and friends together.

That the you know we can talk about science denial and and obviously this occurs on several different levels There is denial of individual topics within science There is denial of kind of the idea of science as an institution or or you know of of things that are maybe Disconfirming for individual agendas or tribes and then there's this kind of more severe I would say even incipit a societal issue of of like you said kind of denying or or being afraid of Authority as a whole and it seems like you know and some amount of that is obviously very healthy But then when you go beyond it It seems like you're kind of almost moving past science denial and into like conspiratorial thinking Do you think that that really is what underlies it's kind of a central theme of most conspiracy thinking? It's just this I do not want to trust authority. Oh absolutely No, you make a good point first of all It's science denial People who do it don't deny all science. They just didn't they just pick and choose So the same who deny global warming let's say we'll go to doctors and take the medicines they prescribe or consult engineers or buildings and so forth But it's only in certain select areas where they practice Science denial so the question is why they do that and it has um as uh And you can you can distrust say one particular scientist or the organization that scientist comes from or the scientist message or the whole scientific community And what I think you were getting at was that the uh now it's different now what happens is politicians make a point of Including our president make a point of denying um the uh Science as a whole um If four political purposes that is you know when Bobby Gindel of Louisiana um rejected his scientific vice he he said that he was being a populist in the model of of Huey Long one of his predecessors So it's become you know science denial is now become part of political posturing I don't know if you meant that's what you meant by conspiracies, but Well, I think that that's a big part of it I was even thinking beyond you know because the other podcast that I work on the skeptics guide to the universe one of the things that we deal with quite often is kind of pseudoscience Extreme pseudoscience and so some of sometimes that comes in the form of like actual conspiracy thinking kind of like believing in A Loch Ness monster or in or in psychics or believing that there is a you know vast liberal conspiracy to um uh Prop up the green energy sector so that you know like in perpetrate this lie of climate change this hoax of climate change Like you know the people who get really really steeped into it to the extent that some other people You know might be like that's like a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist that really is in some ways the extreme version of of basic science denial Yes, wait a couple of things first of all it's important to distinguish Science denial from pseudoscience and skepticism. I mean suppose I go to a doctor Um, and the doctor tells me you have this very serious illness um, you have to take this kind of medicine and I say well I'm gonna take this other medicine that I heard about that I can get in Mexico and hasn't been approved by the uh, this certain studies that were made um approve it That's a doctrine pseudoscience that that's when you are what you are arguing is trying to pass itself off as science But then suppose you go to the doctor and and uh instead you say that You you hear this news from the doctor and you say wait I'm uh, I've heard other doctors say this and I've had other Friends who have taken this other uh, this other medicine and it's okay. I've done my research that skepticism Um, that's where you really take the time to research yourself But in the other hand if I go to the doctor and I say you're wrong you're lying that science denial So you have to distinguish between these three um, uh, between these three things Yeah, I think that's important. Do you think though that science denial often feeds into adapting pseudoscientific views? Oh, yeah, because then you you you tend to look for something to justify yourself I mean that that's you see that in in the anti-vax thing. I mean you you there's this one study by wakefield that uh, that says that um that that links autism and vaccinations Well, you know, it was a study that that has been withdrawn and the sample size was 17 or so so um and wakefield himself has become a kind of celebrity Looked upon as an expert by the anti-vax community So if you deny mainstream science one of the things that you do is look around for somebody that you can cite As an expert even if they aren't um if they aren't at all uh, respectable Isn't it funny then that there's still this underlying kind of Need it's almost impossible to slog through modern society and not have a certain level of trust in expertise of trust and authority because you know It's only the most extreme version and that's kind of where I was getting with the idea of um of Conspiracy thinkers right? It's only the most extreme version in which you can just say I don't trust anybody And I'm going to question everything to the extent that it's not a healthy skepticism But it's actually an outright denial and you know anytime anybody is in a position of power I'm going to assume that they are um They're you know working against my interest as opposed to a healthy skepticism like we discussed which is you know What is their agenda who were they being funded by is this a Political move or is this actually based on the evidence? You know, there's this kind of extreme version where people just don't trust any authority figures But for the most part you really can't survive in the modern world without putting your faith in In a handful of things that you just don't have the competency to understand yourself Right and also sometimes it's justified. I mean um the scientists In in vault who were brought forward by the tobacco industry for instance or by the atomic energy commission And so forth there are sometimes there are Sometimes you're justified in assuming there's a conspiracy. That's why it's yeah the Tuskegee syphilis trials for example Yeah, for example, and think of the lingering impact on that you know, it's very difficult to uh It's often to bring um To do studies in minority communities just because Tuskegee is is a model for how they can be abused But the uh, I mean you mentioned conspiracies. Yeah every time The groundwork for um the the landscape that makes conspiracy theories possible is any kind of social stratification whenever you involve the level of experts um and who are governing or giving advice to um to a public that that that is not fully um Not fully familiar with the experts you that that kind of social stratification is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories um so and and so that that's partly what what's involved here. I mean think of climate change. It's incredibly difficult to um To understand the science of climate change in vault the best way to buy a car is the Werner way You'll find more value every day at Werner Hyundai.

So it has to be piece together in a very complicated way So when you have no single person on top of that then that's you know, that's almost an invitation to be suspicious It's true, and there's also you know, it has become highly politicized. There's also uh some disagreement about certain Uh, I'd say factors within the there is like a main consensus and then there's some you know confusion about You know if this model versus that model is the most appropriate and anytime Unfortunately individuals See scientists themselves disagreeing or they see them iterating which is how science works right like we we find new evidence We can disconfirm old evidence and we can move forward people might see that from a more political view this you know I think that our our political leaders have established this mentality in us that if we change our minds that means that we're no longer um, trustworthy that we're a flip flopper instead of no I changed my mind because I learned something new and I evolved Um, unfortunately that we see is like weak in our society and not to be trusted Right, I I have several thoughts about that one of which is that the um climate change is so incredibly complicated There are many many hundreds of dials and you have to know exactly where to set the dials and there's uncertainty Uh, in a few of them such as the behavior of water vapor and and clouds and so forth But they themselves don't add to the overall picture But it's easy for opponents to look at the um To look at the uncertainty and say oh see the scientists are uncertain But that leads me to the other point you made which is that science actually it's part of the point of my book My book said how does this happen and there are some things that make science go That uh also make it vulnerable to science denial and one of them is the fact that it's open ended It's always subject to re-analysis. It's always subject to to new evidence new evidence can get people to To change their minds um and because of that you can get people um Like uh scot pru it's saying well we The climate science is constantly changing. We um in a few years. Maybe we will think differently So there's always new evidence out there So the very thing that this is the ironic thing that i talk about uh in the book The very things that make science strong that make it go the gears that drive it Also appear to give a veneer of legitimacy to those who would deny it So the fact that uh just to repeat myself the fact that it um that so i's open ended uh Revizable in the face of new evidence or analysis Um make it possible to say well, let's let's wait for that and see That's one thing that goes all the way back to Galileo. Do you want to hear a Galileo story or Absolutely, I mean that's kind of what i was going to say is that Obviously there are some takeaways from this that we will get to but i want to go back to the beginning like what were they dealing with what was the pushback well Different kinds of pushback so pushback that bacon god was just um governmental inertia why should we uh Why should we adopt your your plan when it requires spending a lot of money and we don't know whether it will work on that check okay, so we still deal with that today like every day Yes, and so he had proposed to utopia use many things he used the language of the bible for instance the the with that the uh in the bible there were uh Well that there two books the book of nature and the book of scripture and the book of scripture is about how to be moral and the book of nature is about how to understand nature So he would use biblical language and fables and and and short stories in order to communicate The importance of doing science um Galileo also did that too his primary um the primary pushback he got got was not from the government um but from For for bacon it was king James, but for him it was the religious authorities his primary pushback was guess the religious authorities and remember i mean this is a long story to tell in the book but in the uh there are only a few sentences in the bible that contradict what uh Galileo was saying in the heliosentric um model of of the universe but in the after the reformation in the post um um in in the post council of trend era even if you had a remember that the the process and idea was that everyone can interpret the bible for themselves you didn't need the whole infrastructure of the church but uh the church insisted no they had the right to interpret the bible to provide the authoritative interpretation and uh if only a few sentences the bible appeared to contradict uh appeared to be contradicted by the new science that was a problem and that's what got Galileo in trouble now what Galileo did was and i think this is very instructive for today he um he took the his opponents own authorities that is the religious authorities and turn those authorities uh against them that is he went right back at them so he he he quoted saint uh saint augustine he quoted tertulian he quoted all the the church fathers the saying studying nature is important um and he pointed out that the bible was not about nature that the bible was about um being moral being spiritual um that there's only one planet mentioned in the bible it seems venous and they um and it's bizarrely given the name lucifer but um he he had this wonderful statement that he was a very good writer i mean italo kovino total said that he was the the best writer in the Italian language um but he could be very pithy and sarcastic and at one point he says uh the bible uh doesn't teach us teaches us how to go to heaven not how heaven goes and uh which is a very witty remark and i imagine somebody nowadays saying something like uh the founding fathers um taught us to legislate creation no sorry i blew the joke uh but the founding fathers taught us to create legislation uh not to legislate creation yeah absolutely that's the kind of thing again appealing to um the the the uh people who the the the science deniers consider um authoritative that is the founding fathers so um so what galley did was turn the very arguments of his opponents against them do you think that when you are reading you know you're steeped in your in your research and you're thinking about these things philosophically does it ever like frighten you or piss you off or just like do you ever find yourself helping like how are we still dealing with the same basic basic issues that we were dealing with during galleyos time like how have these these um conflicts not become maybe a little bit more sophisticated well that's an interesting question i don't find it surprising that that we're dealing with the same basic issues i mean remember i'm a philosopher we're still worrying about the nature of the good which is something play to an Aristotle uh worried about we're still exploring justice and beauty and so forth so we're wrestling the same issues what is uh what makes me incredibly angry and i hope that shows up in the book is the fact that the stakes are so much higher and that we expect our politicians to be much more to be governing wisely and the evidence is so much clearer so it's not so much the the issues involved is the uh the clarity of the stakes involved we're facing an existential crisis um and uh are the people who we've elected to the highest offices um are still governing hello it is Ryan and i was on a flight the other day playing

this like unique status amongst politicians where you'll literally hear them say things like well i'm not a scientist so you know my view is the blah blah blah populist one but you never hear them say things like well i'm not an economist or i'm not a you know financial expert but those things are true too but somehow they feel like they can speak with authority on everything but science and science is the place where they're able to like deny authority outright. that's a good question i'm not exactly sure how to answer it my suspicion is that the reason has to do with the fact that the the existential crisis that we face depends so directly upon facts and the natural science about which there is such a strong consensus that is i don't think you can say the same for the social sciences. yeah it's funny it's i mean obviously you've said this multiple times and it really is one of the kind of hallmarks of this book but it's it's like the very thing that makes science such a strong kind of institution is the thing that helps people who are agenda driven sort of try and argue for loopholes within it or deconstruct its it's kind of conclusions and it's almost like the flip side of that you would think that because um there is so much consensus on certain issues that it would be easier for somebody who is in a position where they don't really understand the science themselves because because again they're not a scientist that they could just say oh i don't even have to think about this of course climate change is real i mean 97% of climate scientists all you know argue for that. yeah and that's another thing that makes science strong and which makes it work which also makes it vulnerable which is the fact that it's technical i mean that's related to the point i made a few minutes ago about about strata is that science works partly because it's abstract things are you abstract from a lot of from a lot of things in order to to discover a kind of a back-order framework on which you can evaluate what's what's happening and so it's technical and Galileo for for instance knew this that it was um you you the the his his comment was um you know there's the book of scripture and the book of nature and the book of scripture is written in the language for ordinary people the the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics he said so that the in order to understand nature you had to understand mathematics now that implies that that was a huge um uh importance because it implies that that you can't understand nature without understanding this technical language of mathematics which meant that uh there's the birth of what we now uh call the uh the two cultures the humanities and sciences um is that you need to understand the special language uh this technical language which leaves people on the other side feeling like they're they're excluded from it so you get um you just referred to people saying uh i'm not a scientist that is really commonly said has been said by Robert Kennedy Jr when um in the face of the autism studies it's been said by many the congressman um and it's been said by justice Roberts who when he was um the supreme court justice Roberts who when he was confronted with mathematical evidence of gerrymandering said well i'm not a scientist i'm just uh looking at issues involving democracy so the um the the fact that there's a gap between the language of science and ordinary language seems to justify people saying well that that technical stuff is not relevant here i have to ask do you and it might sound like it's coming a little bit out of left field but um but i promise you it's not do you think that your approach um to you know the the work that you do in philosophy but also like the popular writing that the the history of science work that you do is unique amongst kind of academic philosophers amongst your peers and colleagues because you so seamlessly just then switched between talking about something that uh is very important historically and that is very kind of uh requires i think a lot of his sophisticated historical knowledge to a and a very important modern like issue that's happening right now and that is really politically charged and i feel like sometimes when i communicate with academics they are like i don't want to talk about politics i don't want to go there i that's not my purview and i i need to kind of stay in my lane which i think can be really dangerous because you end up with the silos the siloed understandings that we we don't synthesize very well oh absolutely and and thank you for pointing that out um yes i do feel like i'm different i don't want to be in one silo i don't want to be in one lane i mean what's the point my um i know my academic colleagues will almost all agree with me um but what i i want to communicate something different which is something that uh something that you can only communicate via stories that is stories are special they can people can get up and uh can get caught up in stories to see a deeper lesson that they couldn't without the story i mean that's the point of esophables is that you it's not about a turtle and and a hare or a tiger or uh um you know a fox it's about something else that emerges um more directly and clearly in the story than if you wrote a uh a technical studies so that's what i consider this book to be it's not just ten story individual story it's ten individual stories that each of which make a point but then the overall story of those stories isn't even bigger point yeah and it's a point that's also that would be absolutely and it's not only is it relevant today but it's i think sometimes hard for some people to talk about because i mean we struggle with this in in my other show in the skeptics guide because we have a multi-faceted audience we have a conservative listeners and um liberal listeners and we have libertarian listeners and we talk about scientific skepticism and we dive into that so often scientific skepticism has an application that has direct implications for politics but if we start to talk too deeply about politics or we start to identify too much with individual political leanings which i'm sure at this point you can tell that i'm like ultra ultra left um but you know some people on the show don't want to kind of show their hand what ends up happening is that the discourses shut off people immediately say like oh you're just like a liberal bleeding heart i don't want to listen to you anymore or on the flip side oh whatever you're like rocking your magahat there's no way that you're going to be able to have a rational discussion about this um like actually getting into the grit of the politics and the emotional shit is sometimes messy and it almost makes i think a lot of kind of academics afraid because they're afraid that then their academic lessons are going to be lost in the in the emotional foray oh sure i mean it's so clear to people on the left and to scientists what the right answer is that they can all be the the opponents is being irrational or you know illiterate scientifically illiterate or stupid or you know corrupt or something but there's i think there's more to it than that i mean people aren't it's more complicated than that well then how do you appeal to those people and i thought that that my ideas was stories of of you know stories of human beings that work trying to do the best they could was the the best way to communicate that it is ryan c crest here there

the show absolutely I was I was hoping maybe you know we talked about starting at the beginning with bacon and Galilei and Descartes but then you move forward into into other both scientists and like philosophers and how some of their I guess those those conflicts those difficulties that they ran into can be very telling for us in a modern world are there any stories that really stand out to you that you feel like it would be important for the listeners to hear maybe before they go and buy the book yes there's all of them is the all of them yeah that's why I picked those because each of them has a different you know a gallio bacon and Descartes wrote at a time when when science does exist yet they they had a dream but when the dream starts to be realized then people begin to spot problems with the dream and issues with it people can get too involved with science so that they forget about what philosophers called the life world or science can be dangerous the story of you know Frankenstein that Mary Shelley wrote but the I guess one of my well they're all my favorite stories but one of the most interesting was you know I didn't want this to be just about the west this isn't just a European problem so I wrote about the the Ottoman Empire that used to be one of the great empires of the world it rivaled the Austro-Hungarian Empire the Russian Empire but about the 18th century 70th 18th century it began losing battles to the west and it became obvious that that the reason it was looting losing battles had a lot to do with the fact of the new science and the new technology that the western powers had now what to do how can you do you import this science and technology if you do you're importing stuff that's been invented by and developed by heathens so the question was could you import knowledge from the west and still be a good Ottoman citizen and a believing Muslim and this the result was about a hundred years long cultural debate at all levels you know from the highest level from the sultan down to newspapers and poems and plays and so forth and cartoons about whether how to cope with this what the the virtue was in adopting western science and technology and the point was here was an existential threat and they were discussing discussing how to do with it in a culture-wide debate well that's the kind of debate that we need that the west needs to have again it did once upon a time and it and we need to do it again so that's one of my favorite stories in the book it's still happening right I mean it's still it's like that's obviously why you wrote it but it's still so important this idea of these kind of culture I guess wars I hate to use such a cliche but like this idea of these culture wars these disagreements about fundamental moral issues or fundamental kind of religious issues that maybe preclude the ability to share technology or the ability to share iterative knowledge um between tribes between societies I mean it's it's funny when sorry to take a tangent but again I mentioned the other show that I work on we argue a lot about space exploration we argue a lot about kind of futurism and this idea of um uh cologne basically what I view is like a colonial kind of very western male view of like we need to go and we need to settle on other lands and I'm very like against this view um and there seems to be this kind of intrinsic moral conflict that even though the science might be uh non-emotional I don't know how to put it there's there's a fundamental like should we that comes out of it and one of the arguments that I often make about settling Mars for example when people say oh we'll have the technology in 50 a hundred years don't worry we're going to be there I'm like yeah but we're not going to have the human capability like we physically cannot go to war we physically can't like have like appropriate diplomacy still to this day and we think that just because the technology takes us somewhere that somehow humans are going to become more sophisticated in our thinking and in my view modern science and technology is highly outpacing our basic kind of philosophical and humanitarian um evolution is this something that you grapple with? No sure no that goes back that basically goes back to the issue we talked about before in terms of you know is it desirable to make everyone a scientist um the thing is who it would be nice to work on switch and we could switch it on and humanity would suddenly go oh yeah we have to trust scientists but that there is none and there will never be one you know the bad the the battle for establishing authority will be ongoing you know it's sort of like uh trusting someone in a relationship there's no switch you can turn on to say oh yeah this person will trust me um I will trust this person it's you know yeah trusting is always a mon it always involves a monitoring and and looking for whether things are going wrong or not so the um the you know the the struggle to to promote and maintain the authority of science is going to continue and should continue um and and part of it will be having to to tell the um the the the story of what it's like if we don't trust science I mean that that's another of my if I could stop and talk about another of my favorite stories uh that of of August Combe who is a French philosopher and he realized that uh science as few scientists did that that science is not inherently self-authenticating that is you know people have to be convinced people have to be reminded of how terrible things were before modern science and so one of the things that he argued for that was needed in the future was to periodically tell the story of how we got to be how the human uh how humanity got to be where it is and what it was like when we thought that we had to appease the gods to keep the floods from happening or the lightning from striking um so important so when we forget to do that all the time yeah and and what I compared it to was a a sader that is you know how at the sader people tell the story of how of the you know liberation from Egypt to sort of remind ourselves uh uh remind the people are telling it who they um who they are and where they came from um that's a content effect said that in order to maintain the authority of modern science you need something like a scientific sader to to retell the story again and that's part of what I thought I was hoping to do in the book oh absolutely I mean I guess take it to its extreme though um and I think it's equally important and and I know that you do too because you talk about it in the book this idea of and sometimes I actually find sorry I'm like restarting my thought ten times over sometimes working as a science communicator I see these arguments and these struggles within the scientific communication uh uh uh uh community which is I need to advocate for science even though like I'm not a journalist I'm a communicator and so I need to advocate for science um because there's such a big trust issue that I don't want to tell stories that are going to induce any sort of questioning because it's going to undermine the point of advocating for science but we all see what happens to when you have this almost uh this purely logical positivist this almost like religious fervor for science I mean you see it's happening in Silicon Valley right now with a kind of futurist almost like a libertarian futurist movement that can actually be kind of scary and a little go off the rails as if science has all the keys to to morality or as if science can solve every ethical or philosophical problem on the planet like science is what science is but it's not other things that makes sense that raises a whole bunch of complicated uh issues I mean the which is how do you advocate for science I mean my stony brook where where I teach has a uh communications science communications workshop it's the Alan Alda Center for communicating science it was sent up by the actor Alan Alda who's very interested in science and I teach a scientist how to communicate what they do better um that's good but it's only a part of it you know it's it's uh uh public won't trust science you know trust science a little bit more if the scientists can communicate better but it's the feeling that what is really needed is the feeling that science is not just a specific interest but a general interest that is you know in the halls of congress or in governments uh scientists are just one voice among many you know housing poverty and and and so forth and how do how to communicate that that those voices are not speaking just for an interest group um but for a general interest of general social interest um and that's the that's the struggle that's the struggle that's going to have to continue um but I think you were um but you were talking about something different which is specific like a dogmatism like a like a like a like a worship of science that goes beyond what the purpose of the scientific method is and almost a deify science to be able to answer questions or solve problems that are not even kind of within the purview because it's not um you're not capable of disconfirming evidence in those areas well you know sometimes that's important uh i mean science uh another side of science is symbolism and the sometimes the symbolism is is useful for gathering support for science so i'm thinking of you know the large particle accelerators discovery the Higgs boson or you know the program the Kennedy announced in 1961 to land someone on the moon now that you know galvanized a lot of uh public interest but as you point out there other uh initiatives that are kind of red herrings in terms of um uh uh the social social impact and social importance yeah and i i mean i guess i guess my biggest concern lately because i'm so active within the skeptic community and i know that this is maybe a very small concern because science denial as a whole is a much larger issue but this like rabid like science is the only way to truth this idea that science and i agree science is kind of in many ways the best epistemology that we have um because i mean that's what i do for a living right i'm a science communicator and evangelizer to some extent and i agree that science as an epistemology is like super super important because it's iterative and it has you know the scientific method is the best method we have but it doesn't apply to everything and i think that that's where the breakdown comes in when people think that science is the only epistemology and that it's fully applicable to every single moral or philosophical problem oh absolutely i mean i i love the skeptic uh skeptical community i i i believe in what they do on the other hand it can have a certain tone and the tone is our our opponents are scientifically illiterate there's a rising tide of of irrationalism in the country today and so forth and i just don't think that that's helpful because ultimately people trust science and accept the authority of science not um not out of scientific reasons but out of human reasons you know though they they have to think that it's uh as kong said that science will help them live better and that's not that that's something that you that that you have to appeal to uh personal experience and uh personal notions for what the good is i mean those people are scientists and they shouldn't be their humanity or their sportsmen or their their their parents and so forth and you have to appeal to the kinds of values that those people uh have living in their lives not just scientific values and again that's why i think stories are are the way to go rather than you know denunciations i mean in in science magazines every few weeks you've seen them in nature and science and so forth there's denunciations of you know very specific compelling uh refutations of uh science deniers um but they they an impact so we have to ask the question what and this is this is a kind of epistemology too what gets uh this is a kind of epistemology you have to study what what how do you uh communicate and convince people who aren't scientists of the authority of science uh exactly i mean that's it's it's so self apparent if you study science right but to the extent that it almost seems cult like to the outside it's like oh you go to a quote liberal institution you study the scientific method and all of a sudden you you can't see the world any other way of course the scientific method is the best method we have and blah blah blah blah but from an outsider that seems religious from an outsider that seems like a cult like why why should i believe and trust that and i don't want to even dip my toe in because the minute that i do they're going to get me you know with their liberal knowledge and it's it's a it's a it's a very difficult thing to communicate to people who like overtly do not trust and so we've for decades in the science communication um community we're like oh it's a knowledge deficit problem it's a knowledge deficit problem and then we started to do actual social science work on the problem and realized no it's freaking not the we can't just shove more information in people's faces that is not how you how you open up the conversation so what is the solution exactly it is not a knowledge deficit a problem it's it's a um well let me tell you about my favorite photograph in the book my favorite photograph i don't know if you saw it at the very end shows somebody sitting in the middle of railroad tracks reading a newspaper with his dog by his side and uh you know he's facing up the railroad tracks and the question you you can imagine this right if you don't have him from yeah i'm actually looking at it right now but yes everybody listening can imagine it's a pretty dramatic photograph especially when it's in color he's in the he's like on the track he's right on the tracks um and the the tracks uh you know turner corner so that you expect any minute a local motive is going to come down and the question is you know he's stupid for sitting in the tracks well there's two ways that you could prevent him from getting killed one of which is put someone from the outside putting great great regulations on you know you have more police you have barbed wire surrounding the tracks so that you he can't get off you have warning signs but that doesn't change what's in his head because in his hey it's Ryan C crest life comes at you fast which is why it's important to find some time to

him to get off the tracks are you know they're part of the liberal elite they're they're you know they want him off for other reasons they're getting paid off and so forth and though those ways forcibly get him off the tracks but the key thing is to get inside his head and make him convinced leave him convinced that it's dangerous to be on the tracks so you have to get inside his head rather than forcefully remove him from the tracks and that's the kind of epistemology that we need how do you convince him that he's in danger and there again I think stories will do that better than shouting at him yeah you know it really it reminds me a little bit I see a parallel with some of the clinical work that I've been doing the therapy work that I've been doing lately where and and that really has opened my eyes up as a skeptic having this more kind of empathic view of where people come from it reminds me of I think the the arguments that we see in the addiction world where they're you know historically legislation and policy has been all about removing access to the drugs you know somebody who is struggling with addiction well if they can't get the heroin or if it's more illegal or if we you know lock them up in a treatment facility where they can't and yes that solves the problem in the short term but ultimately if we're not approaching why that person keeps using over and over and over and over and we're not getting to the basic psychological issues that this coping mechanism are alleviating you know that this palliation is is providing then it we're what is the point like it's like we're trying to mediate a problem that has a vaccine like why not prevent it and I think that's the real issue that that we struggle with across the board and I think that that image is such a perfect example of that like how do we meet a person where they're at instead of trying to speak to them in French about an issue that they only know in German right but the the problem is it's especially if you know French really well that's the that's the easiest way that you can think up to talk to that person I mean the I also refer to that's a real temptation that we were talking about before I also refer in the book to the movie jaws you've seen jaws right oh yeah well I show my there's a spot right near the beginning that involves three people on the beach the mayor the scientist played by the nerdy Richard Draifus and the sheriff and the scientist said says there's a shark out there you have to close the beaches the mayor says we can't close the beaches because there's so much because our economic well-being depends on it and by the way and do you have any evidence and and actually you just want to get in the pages of the national geographic and then the sheriff is trying to figure out what to do now in my classes I show in science and technology I showed this this two-minute clip at the beginning of the class and I say this is this is the scariest part of the movie it's a far more than any of those scenes involving sharks because you see immediately why the mayor is doing what he's doing and that he's justified doing it that is you know he's elected to represent the people on the town he knows the people in the town he is well-being he's his job is to protect the well-being the economic well-being of the people in the town whereas nobody knows who Richard Draifus is and he's nerdy he has no social skills he has no evidence that the mayor can understand so that's you know the point is the mayor it's not irrational he's not scientifically illiterate he knows what a shark is and so that that whole scene sets the problem and the but the the real problem is we are sitting in the audience of the movie we know there's a shark out there because we've heard the music and we've probably seen it times before we know there's a shark out there and we can easily say you know you're such an idiot believe Richard Draifus but if you were on the beach it would be very difficult to decide who to believe it's true and I mean it takes me back to trying to put my myself in the shoes of and sometimes I've got to admit even as somebody who's working as a therapist like I said who's really striving to always be as empathic as possible putting myself in the shoes of somebody in in a Trump rally where he is you know talking about this hoax and that hoax and he's sowing all sorts of disinformation and a person with a much more populist view who is really concerned about the economic well-being of their family you know and and I'm maybe talking about somebody in the audience who's not racially motivated and who's not you know a nationalistic but just somebody who's in the audience who literally is listening to these things and they just make sense to them it's such a sometimes really difficult thing to do to meet somebody there but it's so important for us to be able to do it we see that's where you use the word make sense and those are the key those are the two key words because things don't make sense on their own things make sense only in the context of a bigger story once again you have to read to figure out a way how to retell that bigger story so all of a sudden it doesn't make sense anymore and I think that you know there are some luckily some very good outlets and organizations that have that get that who have always get that gotten that I really advocate that I think everybody should watch front line on PBS because I think it's one of the best documentary series of our modern era it's very in many ways neutral but it's also beautiful in terms of its inter I mean as neutrals you can be but it's beautiful in terms of its contextualization as an investigative journalistic unit so that when they tell the story of Trump getting elected they tell the as whole the story as they can about where the country is at that point in time and why people want a leader like Trump because if you look at these things in isolation like you said they don't make sense you have to have the context yeah no I completely agree you you need to tell as big a story as possible so big that people can recognize their own role and their own past beliefs in that story yeah and so that you can wonder a big story so that you a big enough story so that you can tell oh here's why Trump supporters see that they fit in here's why it it makes sense for Trump for people to vote for Trump only if you tell that big a story do you have any chance of moving beyond where we are now yeah I mean to maybe borrow a more physics not even an astronomy metaphor for for the listeners out here who are who are stargazers you can't start looking for the the thing that you're looking for in the sky this the lestial object a messier object for example on the highest field of view because you lose all context you're never going to be able to find it you you know same thing with microscopes right when you're looking for an individual organism under the microscope you have to start on the lowest field of view possible so that you can get the entire context of what you're looking at then you can focus in and you can start doing the the more specific work but periodically you'll lose it and you've got a widen back up so that you can find it again it's the only way that you can really understand something is in its connected context and so often we just don't think about that and you've done such a good job of showing us that connected context um temporarily not just in terms of taking a snapshot of where we are today but how we've taken so long to get where we are you know it's what we think today is based on hundreds of years of ideology and change exactly and what we're going through is not that much different from what people have been going through for 400 years and so if we learn from that if we learn from um from the history of how we got here it will help us understand the present more but see that's a different kind of a epistemology than scientific epistemology which which addresses just the the evidence here and now oh absolutely almost devoid of context which yeah can can have pretty dire consequences as we've seen with like the Manhattan project for example or any of those real extreme examples where you know we we basically are so narrowly focused on solving one problem or even just like throwing satellites up you know we talk a lot about the space junk issue obviously the technological problems that satellites have solved are huge they are amazing and life would be very different if we didn't have satellites but sometimes we've got to think about you know what happens when we just keep putting a bunch of shit up there like where's it going to go what happens when they start crashing into each other or you know the plastic pollution problem that's a great example plastic solves so many problems it's such an important product it also is wreaking havoc on the environment we just didn't think about that in a contextual manner and the thing is these unintended consequences are sometimes blatantly obvious if we were to take a larger contextual view um you know there are definitely always the stories and the examples of people who were ringing those alarm bells early on because they saw the big picture um it's it's actually very rare to say oh nobody saw this coming um someone did we probably just didn't really listen to them um you you I've just got to say you've done such a beautiful job in this book of kind of bringing things really full circle but also raising I think a very important alarm um and not being afraid to to kind of put these really tough issues in front of the reader um that maybe are are a little bit uncomfortable to think about that but that are really really important to think about and so number one I want to thank you for that and number two I was hoping that you know we were coming up on the hour point that before we actually um go that maybe I can open things up and ask you the same two questions that I close every podcast with maybe before we do that though is there anything else that you feel like we didn't get to that um we'd be really remiss not to mention well with respect to the last point I just wanted to say that that reminds me of another story that I tell in the book which of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein which is exactly that that point which is that it's the story of somebody who was told you know Dr. Frankenstein who was um told uh you know to go ahead and just explore as far as he could and re and go into every corner of nature to discover things and um that the words that Mary Shelley used uh evoke um words that bacon and daycart uh wrote so it's it's an it's a perfect example of someone who is encouraged to pursue knowledge as strongly as possible but who uh then produced something that had um unanticipated consequences yeah this idea of this kind of unfettered unchecked and one of the things that I think we often hear when we study science is you know investigation for the sake of knowledge studying learning just for the sake of understanding is something that's very pure and something that should be celebrated and although I I agree with that I only agree with it to an extent yeah there is you know there is always going to be something that we have to think about and I think now we've got these more uh modern examples of that like human genetic engineering for example CRISPR is a great example like we've got to be thinking of the ethics of this instead of just pushing the technology to the limit but um but yeah anyway so so Robert I always close every episode with the same two questions and like the as a philosopher as a historian of science as somebody who um really grapples with these these deep issues and of course is presenting them to us in a way that we can grapple with them as well I am going to be I think fascinated to hear your responses to these questions but I have to warn you they're kind of big picture and I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit no worries so I want you to think about the future which obviously you do um you do in your in your book especially by relating relating it to the past so when you think about the future and whatever context is is relevant in your mind right now so it could be big big big like like cosmic level or it could be maybe very personal um number one I want to know what is the thing that truly does keep you up at night if you had to pick one thing that you are really concerned about maybe even pessimistic maybe even cynical like very deeply concerned about uh what is that and then on the flip side so we can end things on maybe a later no more positive note um what is the thing that you are truly authentically optimistic about you know not playing lip service like the children are the future although that might be it but like at a deep level what is it that when you think about it you're like okay things are going to be okay I'm actually really looking forward to this so your two questions are um what are my pessimistic about and what am I what I'm optimistic about yeah like what are you exactly and what keeps me going and what keeps you going yeah that's a good way to put it I guess what keeps me up at night is the lack of enough good stories for people to realize what's happening to us I mean we're the the way I put it at one point in the book is you know science denial is like shouting stay put in a burning building um and how do you get people to realize that the building is burning and to listen to um and to reject the um the advice that's being shouted at you so my my fear is what keeps me up is that they're the uh we don't have enough for those big stories and it should be the task of the humanities to provide those stories and but the humanities are becoming increasingly specialized so um I'm really worried that the humanities aren't up to facing the problem that we need uh to face which is of writing these big enough stories um but on the flip side what am I optimistic about I'm optimistic about uh about the fact that we can write those stories and it's the kind of thing I like to do and I will um I will continue working on it so I think those stories can be written compelling vivid stories um with very strong characters and terrific plots that that that that make clear to those read them what's happening what's going on and what we have to do here here guys the the book is the workshop and the world what 10 thinkers can teach us about science and authority Robert thank you so much I learned so much from you today and it really I'm feeling really inspired here at the end of our chat but thank you Carol it was wonderful being on the the program absolutely and everybody listening thank you for coming back week after week I'm really looking forward to the next time we all get together to talk nerdy g w group void for prohibited by law 21 plus terms and conditions apply
